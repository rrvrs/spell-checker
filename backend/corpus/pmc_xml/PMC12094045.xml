The essential FA linoleic (18:2n-6) and a-linolenic acids (18:3n-3) are partially converted to longer-chain FA: 18:2n-6 to arachidonic acid (20:4n-6), and 18:3n-3 to eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3). We compared abomasal infusions of 18:2n-6 (N6) and 18:3n-3 (N3) on the incorporation of essential FA into the milk fat of cows. Infusions lasted 20 days, with subsequent carryover evaluation until day 36. During the treatment period, n-3 FA transfer efficiency to milk for N3 was 47%, whereas n-6 FA transfer efficiency to milk for N6 was 39%. In addition, only n-3 FA had a positive carryover effect. However, the absolute quantity of n-3 FA in milk fat was still very low, especially considering 20:5n-3 and the lack of 22:6n-3.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ceab20"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="celist10"><list-item id="celistitem10"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="para10">Abomasally infusing 18:3n-3 increased n-3 FA in milk fat.</p></list-item><list-item id="celistitem20"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="para20">Positive carryover effects were observed for n-3 milk FA.</p></list-item><list-item id="celistitem30"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="para30">We did not detect 22:6n-3 in milk.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><abstract id="ceab30"><p>Our objective was to compare abomasal infusions of linoleic (18:2n-6) and &#x003b1;-linolenic (18:3n-3) acid on the incorporation of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids (FA) into the milk fat of dairy cows and to evaluate their potential carryover effects. Six rumen-cannulated multiparous Holstein cows (252 &#x000b1; 33 DIM) were fed the same diet and assigned to 1 of 2 treatments in a completely randomized design with repeated measures. Treatments were abomasal infusions (67 g/d total FA) of (1) n-6 FA blend (N6) to provide &#x0223c;43 g/d 18:2n-6 and 8 g/d of 18:3n-3; or (2) n-3 FA blend (N3) providing 43 g/d 18:3n-3 and 8 g/d 18:2n-6. The treatment period lasted from d 1 to 20, and the carryover period lasted from d 21 to 36. Compared with N6, the N3 treatment increased the yields of total n-3 FA, 18:3n-3, and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) from d 4 to 20, decreased total n-6 FA from d 8 to 20 and 18:2n-6 from d 8 to 16, and tended to decrease arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) from d 12 to 16. During the treatment period, n-3 FA transfer efficiency to milk for N3 was 47%, whereas n-6 FA transfer efficiency to milk for N6 was 39%. A similar pattern was observed for milk FA content, with N3 increasing the contents of total n-3 FA, 18:3n-3, and 20:5n-3 from d 4 to 20; and decreasing total n-6 FA from d 4 to 20, 18:2n-6 from d 4 to 16, and 20:4n-6 from d 12 to 16 compared with N6. We only observed positive carryover effects for N3, with the treatment increasing or tending to increase the yield of n-3 FA until d 28 and increasing the content of total n-3 FA until d 26. We observed no carryover effects for N6. In addition, we did not detect 22:6n-3 either during the treatment or carryover periods. In conclusion, abomasally infusing N3 and N6 for 20 d increased the yields and contents of n-3 and n-6 FA in milk fat, respectively. Interestingly, the increases were more pronounced in n-3 than in n-6 milk FA, with a transfer efficiency of 47% and 39% during the treatment period, respectively. Furthermore, a positive carryover effect was observed only for n-3 FA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="para40">Linoleic (18:2n-6) and &#x003b1;-linolenic (18:3n-3) fatty acids (<bold>FA</bold>) are essential for dairy cows because mammals lack the enzymes &#x00394;<sup>12</sup>- and &#x00394;<sup>15</sup>-desaturase capable of inserting double bonds distal to position 10 of the carbon chain (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Palmquist, 2009</xref>). These PUFA can be further elongated to longer-chain PUFA, with 18:2n-6 being converted to arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and 18:3n-3 to eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Palmquist, 2009</xref>). Both n-6 and n-3 FA are vital for several biological processes, such as being constituents of cell membranes, synthesizing eicosanoids, and modulating the immune system (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Palmquist, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Moallem, 2018</xref>). However, although 20:4n-6 can be converted to proinflammatory eicosanoids, n-3 FA and their products have the potential to reduce excessive inflammatory responses (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Palmquist, 2009</xref>). Thus, some authors have proposed that dietary supplementation of n-3 FA to dairy cows could also benefit consumers, as milk and its derivatives are important and popular components of Western diets (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Moallem, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="para50">Ruminal biohydrogenation is the primary factor challenging the enrichment of PUFA in milk. This process has several steps, with the general outcome being the extensive conversion of unsaturated to saturated FA by rumen bacteria (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to biohydrogenation, the storage and transport of absorbed n-6 and n-3 FA play a crucial role in determining the transfer of PUFA to milk. Lipid fractions such as phospholipids (<bold>PL</bold>) and cholesterol-ester (<bold>CE</bold>) less efficiently supply FA to the mammary gland compared with triglycerides (<bold>TG</bold>) and nonesterified fatty acids (<bold>NEFA</bold>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Christie, 1981</xref>).</p><p id="para60">Abomasally infusing PUFA avoids rumen biohydrogenation, allowing for more detailed examination of postabsorptive metabolism of these FA. In our companion paper, we reported the effects of abomasally infusing 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 on the incorporation of n-6 and n-3 FA into plasma lipid fractions of lactating dairy cows and evaluated their potential carryover effects (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">dos Santos Neto et al., 2024</xref>). In this paper, our objective was to compare the effects of these same infusions on the incorporation of n-6 and n-3 FA into the milk fat of dairy cows and evaluate their potential carryover effects.</p><p id="para70">The animals and treatments in this study are the same as those reported in our companion paper (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">dos Santos Neto et al., 2024</xref>). Experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Michigan State University (East Lansing, MI). Six rumen-cannulated multiparous Holstein cows averaging 252 &#x000b1; 33 DIM and 44 &#x000b1; 6 kg milk/d (mean &#x000b1; SD) from the Michigan State University Dairy Cattle Teaching and Research Farm (East Lansing, MI) were randomly assigned to one of 2 treatments in a completely randomized design with repeated measures. Before the start of the experiment (&#x02212;2 d), pre-treatment measurements were taken, and abomasal infusion devices were inserted into the abomasum as described previously (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Tyburczy et al., 2008</xref>). Treatments were abomasal infusions (67 g/d total FA) of (1) n-6 FA blend to provide approximately 43 g/d 18:2n-6 and 8 g/d of 18:3n-3 (<bold>N6</bold>); or (2) n-3 FA blend to provide 43 g/d 18:3n-3 and 8 g/d 18:2n-6 (<bold>N3</bold>). The choice of doses, the proportions of safflower, high linolenic flaxseed, and palm oil used, and the FA profile of treatment blends are described in detail in <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">dos Santos Neto et al. (2024)</xref>. The capitalized acronyms N6 and N3 are used only when referring to the abomasal infusion of n-6 and n-3 FA blends in the current study. The N6 and N3 treatment blends were prepared using safflower, high 18:3n-3 flaxseed, and palm oil. The oils were saponified to ensure infusions were supplied as FA rather than triglycerides (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">dos Santos Neto et al., 2024</xref>). Daily doses of N6 and N3 were weighed in individual glass jars and dissolved in ethanol, resulting in an infusate solution of 108 mL. The infusate solution was divided into 4 equal infusions per day at 6-h intervals. Infusate solutions were delivered into infusion lines using 60-mL plastic syringes. This treatment period lasted from d 1 to 20. After d 20, all cows remained on the same diet but did not receive abomasal infusions. This carryover period went from d 21 to 36. Cows were housed in individual tiestalls and milked twice daily (04:30 and 15:30). Throughout the treatment and carryover periods, all animals received a common diet (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">dos Santos Neto et al., 2024</xref>) formulated to meet their nutrient requirements (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">NRC, 2001</xref>).</p><p id="para80">The collection and analysis of diet ingredients and orts, as well as diet and N6 and N3 formulations, are described in our companion paper (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">dos Santos Neto et al., 2024</xref>). Access to feed was locked from 08:00 to 10:00 for collection of orts and offering of the new feed. Feed intake was recorded, and cows were offered 115% of the expected intake at 10:00 daily. Water was available ad libitum in each stall, and stalls were bedded with sawdust and cleaned twice daily. Pre-treatment DMI and yields of milk and milk components were determined on d &#x02212;2 before the first infusion. During the treatment period, DMI and milk yield were determined daily, and milk samples were collected on d 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 of infusions. During the carryover period, these variables were evaluated on d 22, 24, 26, 28. 30, 32, 34, and 36. Milk yield was recorded, and 2 milk samples were collected at each milking.

Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with repeated measures as Y<sub>ijk</sub> = &#x003bc; + F<sub>i</sub> + T<sub>j</sub> + C<sub>k</sub> (F<sub>i</sub>) + F<sub>i</sub> &#x000d7; T<sub>j</sub> + pFM + e<sub>ijk</sub>, where Y<sub>ijk</sub> = the dependent variable, &#x003bc; = the overall mean, F<sub>i</sub> = the fixed effect of treatment, T<sub>j</sub> = the fixed effect of time, C<sub>k</sub> (F<sub>i</sub>) = the random effect of cow within treatment, F<sub>i</sub> &#x000d7; T<sub>j</sub> = the fixed effect of the interaction between treatment and time, pFM = pre-treatment measurement used as a covariate, and e<sub>ijk</sub> = the residual error. First-order autoregressive was the covariance structure used for analysis. To estimate milk FA yield response (<bold>FAYR</bold>) to additional FA intake, we used the predicted individual milk FA yield values adjusted for covariates. Milk FAYR was calculated for each sampling day during the treatment period for both n-6 and n-3 FA. For each day, FAYR-n-6 (%) = [(n-6 milk FA yield of individual cows on N6 &#x02212; average n-6 milk FA yield of N3)/(n-6 FA infused in individual cows on N6 &#x02212; average of infused n-6 FA of N3)], and FAYR-n-3 (%) = [(n-3 milk FA yield of individual cows on N3 &#x02212; average of n-3 milk FA yield of N6)/(n-3 FA infused in individual cows on N3 &#x02212; average of infused n-3 FA of N6)].

Interestingly, N3 increased the yields and contents of 20:5n-3 and 22:5n-3 in milk, but we did not detect 22:6n-3, highlighting that the conversion of 18:3n-3 to 22:6n-3 is very inefficient, as discussed in our companion paper (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">dos Santos Neto et al., 2024</xref>). This also agrees with a review by <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Moallem (2018)</xref>, in which the author did not detect 22:6n-3 in milk fat in any of the experiments supplementing dairy cows with flaxseed products. Interestingly, a recent study by <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Gervais et al. (2023)</xref> that infused high doses of flaxseed oil (0, &#x0223c;70, &#x0223c;140, &#x0223c;280, and &#x0223c;560 g/d) detected 22:6n-3 in milk fat but found no effect of treatment on this FA.</p><p id="para170">Consistent with our observations in plasma lipid fractions (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">dos Santos Neto et al., 2024</xref>), the relative increase in n-3 milk FA was higher than for n-6 milk FA. Considering yield differences, N3 increased total n-3 FA by 16.5 g/d and N6 increased n-6 FA by 13.7 g/d. Furthermore, carryover effects were observed for n-3 but not n-6 milk FA. This is consistent with our companion study, where we observed a positive carryover effect for n-3 but not n-6 FA in plasma TG and NEFA (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">dos Santos Neto et al., 2024</xref>). Although these lipid fractions were not the most responsive to our treatments, they are the fractions that predominantly deliver FA to the mammary gland (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">dos Santos Neto et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Christie, 1981</xref>). In addition, these results could be associated with the preference of &#x00394;<sup>6</sup>-desaturase for 18:3n-3 over 18:2n-6 during the first step in the biosynthesis pathway of longer n-3 and n-6 FA (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Palmquist, 2009</xref>). We observed higher FAYR for n-3 FA compared with n-6 FA during the treatment period. Notably, FAYR for n-6 FA was 39%, lower than the 46% reported by <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Drackley et al. (1992)</xref> when abomasally infusing over 5 times more 18:2n-6 than our current study (240 vs. 43 g/d). <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Urrutia et al. (2023)</xref> abomasally infused single bolus doses of &#x0223c;49 or 80 g/d of 18:3n-3 and observed FAYR of 59 and 43%, respectively. We observed an FAYR average of 47% for n-3 FA when infusing 43 g/d of 18:3n-3,</p><p id="para180">The actual yields of n-3 FA (N3 = 25.8 g/d and N6 = 9.28 g/d) were lower than those of n-6 FA (N3 = 42.1 g/d and N6 = 55.8 g/d). Our diets had slightly higher levels of 18:2n-6 (1.09% diet DM) than 18:3n-3 (0.90% diet DM, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">dos Santos Neto et al., 2024</xref>). As reported previously, &#x00394;<sup>6</sup>-desaturase has a greater affinity for 18:3n-3 than 18:2n-6. However, 18:2n-6 is normally present at higher concentrations in cellular pools than 18:3n-3, leading to a greater synthesis of long-chain n-6 FA (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Burdge and Calder 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Palmquist, 2009</xref>), which reflects the higher yield and content of total n-6 compared with total n-3 milk FA in the present study. A recent study by <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al. (2023)</xref> observed similar responses in milk FA profile of transition cows fed an n-6 FA-enriched diet based on extruded soybean compared with an n-3 FA-enriched diet based on extruded flaxseed.</p><p id="para190">It is important to emphasize that we abomasally infused the treatments, avoiding ruminal biohydrogenation and ensuring the PUFA were delivered to the small intestine. In practical terms, increasing n-3 FA in milk by feeding 18:3n-3 to dairy cows on farms is challenging. A meta-analysis evaluating feeding studies that included 6 different dietary sources of flaxseed reported a transfer efficiency varying from &#x0223c;2% to 6% (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Leduc et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, the authors did not estimate FAYR, but simply calculated the grams of FA in milk per 100 g of FA consumed. If we use the same approach and consider the basal diet supply of n-3 FA along with the N3 infusion, only &#x0223c;9% of the total n-3 FA provided during the treatment period were incorporated into milk fat. An additional difficulty for enriching n-3 FA in milk is associated with their storage and transport dynamics, where absorbed PUFA are not readily incorporated into lipid fractions that effectively deliver FA to the mammary glands (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Christie, 1981</xref>). As we reported in our companion paper, plasma TG and NEFA were the least responsive lipid fractions to abomasal infusions of N3 or N6. Plasma PL and CE had the highest PUFA content and were the most responsive fractions to these abomasal infusions (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">dos Santos Neto et al., 2024</xref>). Selectively incorporating essential FA into PL and CE ensures their use for vital biological mechanisms and reduces their use in nonessential roles, such as milk fat (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Mattos and Palmquist, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Christie et al., 1986</xref>). <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Gervais et al. (2023)</xref> reported it is possible to overcome this mechanism in cows and increase 18:3n-3 in TG at the expanse of CE when abomasally infusing very high levels of flaxseed (&#x0223c;140 to 558 g/d). However, at &#x0223c;558 g/d, milk was prone to oxidative degradation (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Rico et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, strategies to increase the absorption of PUFA focusing on beneficiating the cow itself rather than on the enrichment of specific FA for human consumption should be more successful.</p><p id="para200">Numerous studies have reported that reducing the dietary n-6 to n-3 FA ratio attenuates inflammation and improves production and reproduction of dairy cows (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Greco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Sinedino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2023</xref>). Our current study was primarily designed to examine alterations in blood plasma lipids and milk FA profile; it was not designed to evaluate production variables, which did not differ between treatments. In addition, this could be related to the fact that we used late-lactation cows (252 &#x000b1; 33 DIM).</p><p id="para210">In conclusion, abomasally infusing N3 and N6 for 20 d increased the yields and contents of n-3 and n-6 FA in milk, respectively. The relative increases were more pronounced for n-3 than for n-6 milk FA. During the treatment period, N3 had a n-3 FA transfer efficiency to milk of 47%, whereas the transfer efficiency of n-6 FA for N6 was 39%. We did not detect 22:6n-3 despite N3 increasing 20:5n-3 and 22:5n-3. Furthermore, a positive carryover effect was only observed for n-3 FA.</p></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bales</surname><given-names>A.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lock</surname><given-names>A.L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effects of increasing dietary inclusion of high oleic acid soybeans on milk production of high-producing dairy cows</article-title><source>J.
