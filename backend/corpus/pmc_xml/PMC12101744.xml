But there has been an ongoing discussion on the extent to which learnings from stated choice studies can be generalized to real-life decisions. As such, one of the most important concerns about the use of stated preferences studies is the existence of hypothetical bias, which is the disparity in preferences in hypothetical and actual situations [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Some of this bias may be explained by adopting a conceptual framework of &#x0201c;psychological distance&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to this approach, an object or decision can be perceived as distant if it is not in the time (temporal distance) or space of the individual (spatial distance), it is considered as belonging to someone else (social distance) or, it is perceived with the low probability of occurrence (hypothetical distance) [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Construal level theory (CTL), a cognitive science theory, describes the impact of psychological distance on individual thinking about technologies or interventions [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. According to CTL, an individual&#x02019;s decision-making is either abstract or concrete, depending on how far the decision is perceived<italic toggle="yes">.</italic> Decisions and events that are part of the individuals&#x02019; direct experience are considered psychologically proximal when they have more detailed and reliable information about these decisions and events, and process and perceive them differently from the psychologically distant entities [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In many areas of health care, investigating public attitudes (potential users) can improve the decision-making process for interventions. Hence, it is important to know how preferences for certain health interventions are shaped by psychological distance (mostly hypothetical and temporal distance). This helps researchers better understand the source of the hypothetical bias and design effective mitigation techniques by reducing the respondents&#x02019; perceived psychological distance in stated preference studies. In health research, only a few previous studies have investigated the impact of psychological distance on perceived disease risk, choice, and behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>This study aimed to explore whether psychological distance from the decision leads to a difference in preferences for prenatal screening strategies. Prenatal screening provides an important scenario and opportunity to study the impact of psychological distance on the decision-making process because non-pregnant women can be considered as the potential users of these strategies and their difference from the current users (pregnant women) is their distance to the real-life choice. By comparing the outcomes of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) conducted for samples of non-pregnant women and pregnant women, we were to evaluate the extent to which the distance from the real-life decision affected the preferences for a prenatal screening test. In other words, how people&#x02019;s preferences changed when the hypothetical situation was changed to a more real one. Investigating the consistency of preferences, perspectives, and resulting hypothetical bias could provide essential evidence for policy decision-making in developing and improving prenatal screening programs in publicly funded health systems. To our knowledge, no previous studies have compared pregnant women&#x02019;s and the public&#x02019;s preferences for prenatal screening and diagnostic strategies. However, differences in preferences can impact choices and decision-making, and the values of both pregnant women and the general public must be considered in developing and implementing prenatal testing strategies. Therefore, it is important to investigate differences between preferences from a general population or societal perspective and the values that pregnant women place on aspects of prenatal screening. This study was to fill the gap in the literature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Good research practices for stated-preference studies were followed in conducting this study and analyzing the data [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the University of British Columbia Behavioural Research Ethics Board (H17-00591). Informed written consent was obtained from respondents.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>DCE development</title><p>Following recommendations for good research practices to conduct a DCE [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we used a mixed-methods approach to develop the DCE attributes and questionnaire. This approach involved both quantitative and qualitative research components. Firstly, a literature review of studies on preferences for prenatal screening and diagnosis was conducted to gather information about potential attributes and levels. In addition, we conducted qualitative research. This qualitative study involved four in-depth, semi-structured focus groups with pregnant women and their partners/support people. Through this qualitative study, important factors such as the time of diagnosis, information on conditions tested, false positives, cost, the invasiveness of the test, and potential harm to women and babies were identified [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These themes showed the conceptual attributes important to participants&#x02019; decision-making for prenatal screening and diagnosis. After collecting a list of potential attributes and possible levels based on the literature review and qualitative study results, we consulted with an expert in medical genetics and prenatal screening about the face validity of these potential attributes and levels. This process led to the selection of five attributes and their corresponding levels: timing of the results, false negative rate, false positive rate, risk of miscarriage, and out-of-pocket cost. We also used the pre-screening risk of chromosomal conditions as a constant attribute.</p><p>The study design was similar to our previously published study estimating public preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for prenatal screening and diagnostic strategies [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As described there, we applied experimental design techniques using SAS (SAS software version 9.4) [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to generate optimal combinations of attributes and levels that respondents evaluated in the DCE. Searching for the maximum efficiency design was based on the D-efficiency measure given the constraints. Using this approach, 36 choice sets were generated and then were blocked into four versions of nine choice questions.</p><p>We applied the within-set dominated pairs test to assess respondents&#x02019; comprehension and consistency. Two fixed questions were added to each questionnaire version, and in these tasks, one of the options was worse than the other alternative in terms of all attributes. Respondents who chose the dominated strategy in both tests were considered to have failed the consistency test. In addition, using response time as a proxy for cognitive engagement, we set time criteria for the questionnaire based on the completion time for our study and the limits used in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We calculated the minimum amount of time for completing the questionnaire based on data from pilot testing (around 3 minutes). Therefore, we set three minutes as the minimum completion time to exclude responses from potentially inattentive people who completed the survey quickly and may not have given the DCE choice questions enough thought. We also wanted the respondents to complete the DCE as uninterruptedly as possible in order for them to be engaged, comprehend the concept of the DCE choice task, and understand the implicit trade-off between attributes. Hence, we assumed respondents who left the survey for longer than 24 hours might have provided less reliable responses. Therefore, those who completed the survey in less than three minutes, or more than 24 hours, or failed the two consistency checks were excluded from DCE data.</p><p>We employed a dual response choice experiment approach [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], in which respondents were first forced to choose among two prenatal screening and diagnostic strategies and then were asked to choose between their chosen strategy from the first stage and a &#x0201c;no screening&#x0201d; option (unforced choice). A sample of DCE questions for forced-choice and unforced choice is presented in <xref rid="pone.0324370.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>. Background information on chromosomal conditions and prenatal screening and diagnosis was included in the questionnaire before the DCE choice tasks. Socio-demographic characteristics and experiences of pregnancy and prenatal screening were asked in the final section of the survey questionnaire. The full survey is included in <xref rid="pone.0324370.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>.</p><p>After developing the DCE questionnaire, we conducted &#x0201c;think-aloud&#x0201d; interviews with 10 respondents as a qualitative pre-testing method to assess the questionnaire&#x02019;s clarity and respondents&#x02019; interpretation. Further, as a quantitative test, two rounds of pilot testing were conducted to determine whether respondents could comprehend the attributes and choices and cognitively manage the number of choice tasks. The data obtained in two rounds of pilot testing was statistically analyzed separately and was not included in the main analyses. A total of 108 and 105 respondents completed the first and second rounds of the pilot testing, respectively. 101 (93%) and 95 (90%) respondents met the consistency and completion time requirements. Based on pilot testing data analysis, the estimated individual-level weights had expected signs and order, which showed that in general, respondents understood the DCE tasks and could manage the number of questions.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study sample</title><p>The online DCE survey participants (18 years and older) for this study were recruited by IPSOS, a global market research firm. Johnson and Orme&#x02019;s rule of thumb [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] was used to determine the minimum sample size (<xref rid="pone.0324370.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>), but we aimed for a much higher number for both samples to achieve sufficient statistical power to estimate preferences [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The first study sample of pregnant women was selected from a survey administered and completed by a group of pregnant women in Canada. The second study sample of non-pregnant women was selected from a survey administered and completed by a sample of Canadian general public members. The samples were collected in May and November of 2018. To evaluate the potential impact of excluding respondents based on time criteria or failing the inconsistency test on the study&#x02019;s outcomes, we undertook a sensitivity analysis that included these respondents in the sample. This analysis was aimed at assessing the robustness of our findings by taking into account the criteria used for respondent exclusion.</p><p>Since the systematic differences between the characteristics of two groups of respondents (pregnant women vs. non-pregnant women) can be a potential confounder when comparing their preferences, we used a greedy matching algorithm to increase the validity of the comparison. We chose the sample of non-pregnant women and the sample of pregnant women who had similar baseline characteristics, i.e., age, sex, education, and whether having children using one-to-one matching. DCE response and demographic data from the matched samples of pregnant women and non-pregnant women were used for the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In this study, the hierarchical Bayes (HB) [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] method has been used to effectively model preference heterogeneity and estimate individual-level part-worth utilities. By combining individual-specific choice data with the prior distributions of the parameters, HB provided a proper method to derive the individual-level utility weights. This approach enhances estimation precision and leads to more reliable individual-level estimates, especially with small sample sizes, by leveraging information from the entire study population. We used MATLAB, edition R2014 (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) for estimating the Bayesian hierarchical model. In the final model, 10,000 initial iterations were discarded as &#x0201c;burn-in,&#x0201d; and 20,000 iterations were used for the estimation. Since the draws from Gibbs samplings were correlated, to reduce the correlation, after convergence, every tenth draw was used, and the rest were discarded. The prior on the covariance matrix was inverted Wishart, and the prior on the random parameters was uninformative. Both forced and unforced data were analyzed.

To account for the scale effect in the coefficients, we used the marginal rate of substitution (WTP) to compare the two samples&#x02019; preferences. Using the individual-level preference weight, we also estimated the probability of choosing different prenatal screening and diagnostic scenarios (the non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT), amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling (CVS), and optimal case) for each respondent. Predicted uptake rates for various scenarios were computed and compared between the two samples. Furthermore, we compared the predicted choice of different prenatal screening strategies with the actual decision for each respondent in both samples to quantify hypothetical bias.

The main diagonal of <xref rid="pone.0324370.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> for each strategy represents the correspondence between the predicted choice in the hypothetical situation and their decision in the real world. Overall, the individual predicted choice of NIPT, CVS, and amniocentesis (versus no screening) agreed with the actual choice respectively for 74%, 73%, and 74% of the pregnant women sample. The consistency between the predicted and actual choices was more significant among respondents who had or planned to have prenatal screening. For the group of respondents who had screened, 80% (NIPT), 74% (CVS) and 75% (amniocentesis) were correctly predicted to choose a prenatal screening and for the women who planned to have prenatal screening, these percentages were 82% (NIPT), 77% (CVS), and 78% (amniocentesis).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0324370.t004"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0324370.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Comparing predicted and actual choices for prenatal screening; pregnant women and non-pregnant women.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0324370.t004" id="pone.0324370.t004g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Pregnant women</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Non-pregnant women</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

We used their response to this question as a measure of their actual decisions. Similar to the pregnant women, the estimated probability of choosing different prenatal screening strategies (NIPT, CVS and amniocentesis) versus no screening was computed and then converted to the predicted choice for each individual non-pregnant woman. The results of comparing the predicted and actual choices for different strategies are presented in <xref rid="pone.0324370.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Out of the 426 respondents in the non-pregnant women, 228 (53%) were previously pregnant. After excluding the respondents who answered &#x0201c;Don&#x02019;t remember&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Don&#x02019;t know,&#x0201d; there were 208 women who specified their previous decision toward prenatal screening. Of this number, 104 (50%) had a previous screening, and 104 (50%) had decided not to have prenatal screening. As the results shown in <xref rid="pone.0324370.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the predictive power of DCE estimates was lower for non-pregnant women. There was correspondence between the predicted choice of NIPT and actual decision for 75% of respondents who have had screening and 40% of the ones who have not had screening. These numbers were 70% and 45% for CVS and 74% and 56% for amniocentesis. Like pregnant women, the consistency between predicted and actual choices was higher among non-pregnant women who have undergone screening compared to those who reported no previous screening.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p>We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of excluding respondents who did not meet internal consistency criteria. The sensitivity analysis aimed to determine whether including these respondents significantly influenced the study&#x02019;s outcomes. The results are presented in <xref rid="pone.0324370.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>. These results indicated that the inclusion of these respondents did not have a significant impact on the overall outcomes of the study. Specifically, the order, sign, statistical significance of attribute levels, and relative importance of attributes remained consistent after including data from this group of respondents.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Discussion</title><p>Conducting the same DCE among pregnant women and members of the general public provided us with the unique opportunity to investigate the impact of being closer to real-life choice on preferences and WTP for prenatal screening and diagnostic testing. Some previous studies compared preferences for prenatal screening and diagnostic strategies between pregnant women and healthcare providers [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To our knowledge, no previous studies have compared the preferences of pregnant women with the general public.</p><p>Our findings showed that for pregnant women, the ability to detect chromosomal abnormalities was the most important attribute of prenatal screening strategies. False-positive rate and procedure-related risk of miscarriage were the second important characteristics. Some previous studies also have found that pregnant women put a great value on the accuracy of the screening and diagnostic strategies, especially the detection rate [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. According to our analysis, time of results in terms of gestational age was not significant for pregnant women when they chose the prenatal screening and diagnostic strategy, which is consistent with the finding of some prior studies [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>For the matched sample of non-pregnant women, false-negative rate and risk of miscarriage were the most important attributes. Same as pregnant women, time of results was not significant for non-pregnant women. Respondents from both samples placed a higher value on strategies with lower cost, higher detection rate, lower false positive rate, and lower risk of miscarriage, and revealed a systematic preference for screening over no screening. The results of our previous study showed that the false-negative rate was the most important attribute for the total sample of the general public. False-positive rate and procedure-related risk of miscarriage were also important for the members of the general population [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Comparing WTP for different screening and diagnostic strategies showed that pregnant women were willing to pay more for improvement in test characteristics than non-pregnant women and general public members [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The results of this study are in line with the assumptions of the CTL. Pregnant women, for whom all aspects of physiological distance to screening decisions were smaller, perceived risk differently from non-pregnant women and showed more willingness to pay for preventive treatment (prenatal screening). Previous studies have shown that smaller psychological distance is associated with an increase in perceived risks [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and that people with higher perceived risk are willing to pay more for health interventions than those with lower perceived risk [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. White et al. (2014) found that psychological proximity can impact threat perception. They showed that people perceived viruses that originated recently (psychologically close) as more dangerous than the ones discovered in distant years (psychologically distant) [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, psychological proximity was associated with an increase in WTP for protections like a vaccine. In another study, Johnson (2018) [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] found that there was a link between a lower psychological distance and an increased motivation to engage in protective behaviours. According to Veldwijk et al. (2019), people&#x02019;s choices for genetic screening for colorectal cancer vary depending on their psychological distance, particularly in terms of temporal and spatial distance [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our results also suggested that non-pregnant women were more sensitive to increases in the cost of an optimal screening and diagnostic strategy compared to pregnant women. Based on our previous analysis, the sensitivity of demand for screening and diagnostic strategies, representing the degree of responsiveness to changes in cost, is also higher among the sample of the general public compared to pregnant women [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These findings are consistent with previous research, which indicated that, in general, individuals are more price-sensitive in hypothetical situations [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Another strength of our study is that we were able to measure and quantify hypothetical bias. We compared the predicted choices for different prenatal screening and diagnosis strategies with the real-world prior decisions of our pregnant and non-pregnant women samples. The results showed a more significant difference between the actual and predicted choice among non-pregnant women. Some previous studies have evaluated the external validity of DCEs in health economics [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but only a few studies compared the comparing predictions to choices in the real world at an individual level [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The difference between the predicted and actual choices in both samples in our study was more significant than Mohammadi et al., with an overall agreement rate of 83% [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and Lambooij et al. with 80% [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and Salampessy et al. with 82% [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and was closer to the results of Krucien et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Similar to these previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], our study&#x02019;s prediction based on DCE results was more sensitive than specific, indicating a higher predictive power of DCE for the respondents who chose to have prenatal screening. This suggested that prior screening experience or seeking information in preparation for the procedure may influence decision-making outcomes, with individuals who have undergone screening (or plan to) showing a greater alignment between their stated preferences and actual choices, potentially mitigating hypothetical bias.</p><p>This study showed that the difference in preferences between hypothetical and actual situations might be explained by the impact of psychological distance on the perceptions, preferences, and choices of respondents in stated preference studies. Implementing methods to decrease the perceived distance to the choice, such as using an educational tool, can help to mitigate or overcome the hypothetical bias in stated preference models [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>One potential limitation of this study was that both questionnaires were administrated online, and pregnant women and members of the general public without access to the internet were excluded. As such, these samples may have been prone to selection biases. Also, similar to other DCEs, the results depend on a limited number of attributes that could be included in the study. As such, there might be some other considerations in individuals&#x02019; real-life decision-making for prenatal testing that is missing from our study. However, by following the recommendations for good practice in designing DCEs and employing &#x0201c;think-aloud&#x0201d; interviews as a pre-testing method and two rounds of pilot studies, we tried to minimize this issue. Next, in terms of generalizability, our study focused on prenatal screening and diagnosis. This raises the question of whether our findings generalize to other areas. Considering that in many areas of healthcare, accounting for the preferences of different stakeholders is significant for informed policy decision-making, it may be of interest to examine the impact of psychological distance on stated preferences in other areas. Additionally, there was a slight difference in wording between surveys for pregnant women and the general public, from which the sample of non-pregnant individuals was selected. In the general public survey, which included male respondents, the wording was, &#x0201c;Please imagine you or your family members are pregnant and considering prenatal screening and diagnosis,&#x0201d; but in the survey for pregnant women it was &#x0201c;Please imagine that you are considering prenatal screening and diagnosis.&#x0201d; Acknowledging the difference, we believe that after matching the two samples by demographic characteristics, it is reasonable to assume that non-pregnant female respondents would empathize with the perspective of a pregnant women and project themselves into that role when responding to the task. In fact, we chose the method of matching the two samples, to ensure that the perspectives elicited were as close as possible. Furthermore, we matched the two groups, considering factors like having children. This approach aimed to avoid confounding effects related to not being pregnant and not having children simultaneously. Although preferences may vary between non-pregnant women without prior pregnancies and pregnant women, we could not identify the specific factors contributing to these distinctions if we didn&#x02019;t match the two samples. Our study primarily focused on assessing the influence of psychological distance, particularly temporal distance. Even though some non-pregnant women had children, their current non-pregnant status can lead to distinct preferences for prenatal screening due to the temporal gap, affecting hypothetical bias. In essence, the passage of time creates a unique psychological context, which we aimed to investigate. Our prior research among the general public indicated that having children was associated with a reduced likelihood of choosing screening over no screening [<xref rid="pone.0324370.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Future studies can delve deeper into the impact of having or not having children on prenatal screening preferences and hypothetical bias.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>According to the findings of this study, although both pregnant women and non-pregnant women placed a higher value on strategies with higher detection rate, lower false-positive rate, lower risk of miscarriage, and lower cost, pregnant women were willing to pay more for improvement in these strategy characteristics and less sensitive to changes of strategy cost. We also evaluated the difference in the predictive power of DCE (hypothetical bias) between the two samples. This difference can be explained by their psychological distance from the decision. The identified hypothetical bias emphasized the special attention paid to the perceived psychological distance in designing stated preference studies. Furthermore, our findings of Canadian pregnant women&#x02019;s preferences for different aspects of prenatal screening and diagnosis have important clinical and policy implications for the development of more patient-centered approaches to prenatal care. These results can be used in designing and implementing prenatal screening and diagnostic strategies in a way that more meet the needs of the target groups. Additionally, they can facilitate predicting the acceptability and uptake of emerging technologies in prenatal screening and diagnosis for chromosomal abnormalities, thereby contributing to more informed decision-making processes in healthcare delivery and policy formulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec024" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0324370.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>A sample of DCE choice sets (forced and unforced).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0324370.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0324370.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Preference weights with 95% confidence intervals;
