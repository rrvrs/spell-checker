There is yet no robust evidence on the effectiveness of SM interventions for people with long-term conditions (LTCs) in LMICs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Underpinned by a comprehensive search of seven databases, we conducted a systematic review and evidence synthesis. Paired reviewers completed study selection, methodological, and data extraction. Here, we report a synthesis considering disease-specific (<italic>e.g.</italic> glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), quality-of-life (QoL), and economic outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 49&#x02009;222 citations, 26 studies were included in the analysis (one systematic review, 14 trials, five cross-sectional, and six qualitative studies). LTCs for which SM interventions were reported included: diabetes (14 studies, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2388), hypertension (six studies, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1779), and arthritis (two studies, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;180). Further, three studies (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;237) were on co-morbid diabetes and hypertension. Interventions were broadly classified as: SM education, mobile health-guided SM, and community-based support for SM. Education on SM showed the most promising improvement in clinical outcomes (<italic>e.g.</italic> mean pain intensity scores from 3.97 to 2.77), functional ability, HbA1c (pre-intervention mean of 8.58% to a post-intervention 8.08% in one study; 9.45% to 8.98% in another study), millimetres of mercury (mmHg) (pre-intervention mean of 129.7/83.7 to a post-intervention 117.9/75.3) and health-related QoL (<italic>e.g.</italic> EuroQol Five Dimension score improvement from 0.77 to 0.89 post-intervention) among patients living with diabetes, hypertension and arthritis compared to usual care. Effectiveness of interventions was dependent on literacy, SM education delivery aids, and disease-specific care, as patients preferred in-person (interactive) education sessions over virtual assistance alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Guided SM interventions with community-based support show promise for improving outcomes for people with common LTCs in LMICs. However, a dearth of cost-feasibility data and variability in outcomes limit decisions on scalability and policy decision making. There is a need for regulatory bodies to develop clinical guidelines and promote implementation of tailored SM education as a core management strategy for LTCs care in LMICs.</p></sec><sec><title>Registration</title><p>PROSPERO CRD42022345762.</p></sec></abstract><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="48"/><page-count count="22"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) and other literatures reports increasing morbidity and mortality from chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) with 86% of premature deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Non-communicable diseases are projected to rise sharply in LMICs, at a greater rate and impact than in high-income countries (HICs) [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. According to the World Bank, NCDs increasingly threaten the health care and economy of LMICs, with these systems not being adequately prepared to face the NCD crisis [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, policymakers, donors and academics have consistently directed more efforts towards acute infectious disease control in resource-limited settings [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Unfortunately, &#x02018;lengthy and expensive&#x02019; treatment costs for NCDs also known as long-term conditions (LTCs) quickly drain household resources and force people in LMICs deeper into poverty, increasing their risk of worsened morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Self-management typically involving individualised partnership with health care providers where the patient actively takes part in their care, are recommended first-line interventions in HICs [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; but these are highly dependent on individual health literacy, and self-efficacy, and are yet to be fully explored in LMICs context for people living with LTCs. Health is a collective and collaborative investment and patients have a crucial role in the management of their disease. During this process, patient develops knowledge on their condition and assume personal skills and coping mechanisms to deal with disease-related adversity [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This fosters a care culture that supports patients as partners in co-creating health, embeds person-centred care in everyday life within the community, ultimately optimises health outcomes, and reduces the burden and need for direct constant care from health care professionals (HCPs) in hospitals. Empowering people through self-management is an excellent way of improving overall patient health, as well as relieving economic stress on the public and overstretched health care systems of LMICs.</p><p>Current evidence support the effectiveness and patient benefit from self-management interventions for LTCs in HICs [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in form of moderate to strong association with improved clinical outcomes [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], increased engagement in self-care behaviour [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], effective mental illness management [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and overall positive health outcomes [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, there is yet no robust synthesised evidence on self-management of LTCs in LMICs. A scoping review highlighted emerging evidence base in support of the employability of self-management for improving care in LMICs [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but it was limited to diabetes and cardiovascular conditions and did not involve an appraisal of methodological quality which is crucial to guide policy and inform clinical decision making. This review aims to present a more up-to-date and appraised evidence via the inclusion of newer studies, other common LTCs (including osteoarthritis and mental health conditions), and considerations for self-management in co-morbid LTCs. The overall aim of this study was to summarise and critically appraise currently available evidence regarding self-management of common LTCs in LMICs. Specific objectives were to identify and appraise current evidence on interventions designed to facilitate self-management of common LTCs in LMICs context, in terms of clinical, quality of life and economic outcomes and explore what are the barriers and facilitators to effective self-management of LTCs in LMICs.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Protocol and registration</title><p>We established a research protocol prior to conducting review. It was submitted to the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO-ID CRD42022345762). We reported this review in conformity with the PRISMA statement [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Information sources and search strategy</title><p>We developed, in collaboration with the information specialist, a search strategy for relevant studies relating to LTCs, and self-management in LMICs. We conducted a comprehensive search of databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AMED, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) for relevant primary studies without setting any date limits up until June 2022. The detailed search strategy (<italic>e.g.</italic> MEDLINE) is provided in Appendix S1 in the <xref rid="S1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Online Supplementary Document</bold></xref>. In addition, we examined reference lists of included articles to identify other potentially relevant article(s). We managed literature search results in Rayyan (Rayyan Systems Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, USA), an online screening software.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility and study selection</title><p>We developed and agreed upon the detailed eligibility criteria. Briefly, we included studies if they reported original research on self-management interventions of one or multiple LTCs, and included adults aged &#x02265;45 years residing in LMICs. We selected the age criteria based on documented age of onset of most common LTCs [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and pragmatically based on contextual knowledge that approach to management, organisation of care, and access to care are also likely to differ for older adults across many health infrastructures in LMICs.</p><p>We defined LMICs according to the World Bank&#x02019;s country and lending group list and excluded studies conducted in HICs. We prioritised interventions that encouraged patients to self-manage at home or in community settings, rather than self-management programmes that are fully supervised by trained health service providers or take place mostly in health care facilities. To be eligible, self-management typically involves individualised or collective partnership with health care providers where the patient actively takes part in their care.</p><p>To be eligible, participants needed to be diagnosed with any one or more common LTCs [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, musculoskeletal conditions (<italic>e.g.</italic> joint pain including arthritis of the knee, hip, back, and widespread pain), which are high contributors to disability-adjusted life years [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] in LMICs. Co-morbid mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, were also eligible, given emerging evidence that mental health problems often co-occur with physical health issues [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>To gain a comprehensive overview of all currently available evidence, the included study designs were either experimental (<italic>e.g.</italic> randomised trials, comparative cohort studies, before-after designs) or non-experimental (prospective or retrospective observational cohort studies, qualitative studies, cross-sectional surveys). We excluded case studies.</p><p>There were no restrictions on the language of publication or the date of publication. However, primary studies published before June 2020, investigating self-management interventions for diabetes in LMICs were excluded, due to the existence of a comprehensive systematic review [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] of self-management in diabetes up to June 2020. It was necessary to apply this criterion in accordance with good practice in order to avoid duplication and research waste. We have therefore included summary information from this review as part of the evidence on self-management intervention for diabetes in LMICs.</p><p>An initial pilot screen was conducted where reviewers independently reviewed a sample of 200 titles and abstracts, and conflicts were discussed among the team to ensure agreement on the selection process and an established eligibility criterion. Reviewers subsequently screened the remaining titles and abstracts according to specified eligibility criteria. All potentially eligible full-text articles were independently reviewed by reviewers in pairs, including detailed notes/reasons for exclusion as appropriate. Disagreements on the eligibility of full texts were resolved by discussion till a consensus was reached among the reviewers or by the independent opinion of a third reviewer.</p></sec><sec><title>Data items and data collection process</title><p>We used a pre-piloted and customised spreadsheet to aid data extraction from included studies. Data items included study characteristics (first author, year of publication), setting, study population characteristics, intervention characteristics (what and how interventions are delivered), treatment effectiveness and outcomes. Where available, information regarding facilitators and barriers, fidelity and feasibility of interventions, as well as patient satisfaction outcomes, was documented. Data was extracted for each paper by one reviewer (TA, MG, and MA) and was independently checked for validity and accuracy by a second reviewer (TA and OB). Disagreements were resolved by discussion until a consensus was reached.</p></sec><sec><title>Quality assessment</title><p>The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated through the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The MMAT was designed to assess an array of study designs (qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies); and is suitable for use in complex systematic reviews that are reporting on context-dependent designs and outcomes, such as in the present study focusing on various self-management interventions across multiple LTCs in variable LMIC settings. MMAT tool assesses validity of study design (clearly formulated research question, appropriateness of outcomes, participants recruitment and selection). It also assesses aspects of study methodology such as delivery of intervention (where relevant), influence of participant characteristics on study outcomes, data analysis and study reporting. Individual MMAT items were reported as a yes, as a no or as unclear. A &#x02018;yes&#x02019; meant the criteria were clearly met, a &#x02018;no&#x02019; meant the criteria were clearly unmet, and an &#x02018;unclear&#x02019; meant that the information provided by the authors was insufficient to make a judgement. This reporting was done on the individual study level and across all the included studies in this review. Differences in opinion were resolved by discussion until consensus was reached or by the independent review of a third party, who also checked for consistency. No studies were excluded on the basis of low scores on the quality appraisal tool used in this review. However, the methodological quality of the evidence base contributing to each intervention was considered in assessing the strength of evidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Data synthesis and analysis</title><p>We did not conduct a meta-analysis due to a high degree of variability in outcome data across included studies. We used a narrative best evidence synthesis approach to analyse data and summarise findings. Primary analyses focused on assessing the effectiveness of self-management interventions on health-related outcomes (disease-specific, quality of life) and, where possible, economic costs/affordability. Further, primary analysis focused on the barriers/facilitators of self-management intervention and scalability in low-resource settings.</p><p>We analysed data and reported findings according to LTC categories &#x02013; diabetes, hypertension, musculoskeletal pain conditions, and mental health. We explored the robustness and impact of methodological quality on overall results, mainly the effectiveness of self-management interventions. We explored subgroup analysis according to self-management intervention approach/subtypes. Variability in outcomes was also explored with reference to the impact of factors such as cultural sensitivity to approach/delivery of self-management interventions, socioeconomic status/literacy of study participants, contribution of caregivers (<italic>e.g.</italic> spouse) and level of involvement of health care professionals in delivery of self-management interventions. We constructed evidence tables to aid the presentation of findings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Study flow and characteristics of included studies</title><p>The literature search yielded 49&#x02009;222 studies, and we selected 331 studies for full-text review. Of the 331 texts, 26 studies met the inclusion criteria and were subject to data extraction and quality assessment. Key reasons for exclusion were that study participants were, on average, aged &#x0003c;45 years, not resident in an LMICs, interventions were solely delivered by health professionals, or studies did not report any direct outcome of self-management intervention (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jogh-15-04148-F1" position="float"/></fig><p>In addition to one systematic review [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the review included quasi-experimental studies (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] of self-management interventions, cross-sectional (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and qualitative studies (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] which explored patients&#x02019; experiences of self-management for LTCs.

Self-management education and advice interventions covered topics such as diet, self-monitoring of disease outcomes, medication adherence, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle. Typically, they were delivered in the first instance by health care professionals (including pharmacists, family physicians, nurses, community health workers (CHWs), and cardiology residents) at different levels of training and qualifications across studies. There was no standardised delivery schedule for self-management education interventions across the different LTCS reported, such that frequency and duration of sessions varied significantly from ten minutes (individual one-on-one session only) to up to 30 minutes of group education, including up to four booster education sessions over 12 weeks.</p><p>mHealth-guided management and community-based support shared similar objectives with the educational interventions, with mHealth interventions utilising remote internet/telephone-based assistance, mobile applications and short message/messaging service (SMS) for monitoring and reminders, while CHWs supported patients in actual self-management activities in community-based initiatives, including home visits (Appendix S3 in the <xref rid="S1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Online Supplementary Document</bold></xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Effect of self-management interventions on health-related outcomes and quality of life</title><sec><title>Diabetes</title><p>Overall, 12 studies (six trials [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], one quasi-experimental [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and three cross-sectional [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]) explored the effectiveness of different self-management interventions among 2237 participants.

All the educational sessions in these trials were face-to-face sessions aimed at educating the patients on the cause/pathology of diabetes as an LTC, its complications, and both the pharmacological and lifestyle approaches to self-management. In a total of 672 diabetic patients, the trials reported statistically significant HbA1c levels reduction (<italic>e.g.</italic> from 9.45% to 8.98% HbA1c in Nazir et al.

The two trials that supported self-management via mHealth have a positive effect on glycaemic control. For instance, in a trial investigating 60 participants [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], diabetes care mobile application in Indonesia fostered improved glycaemic control (HbA1c improved from baseline 8.043 to 6.440% compared to 8.553 to 8.240% in control participants who received usual diabetes care). Similarly, Mohamed et al. [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] highlighted the importance of close follow-up and continuous education for achieving significant reductions in HbA1c levels (1.88% reduction in HbA1c in intervention group <italic>vs</italic> 1.89% increase in usual care group, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.001), indicating that SMS messages received by experimental groups showed promising effectiveness in reinforcing knowledge/capability for self-management.</p><p>Only one study [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] explored the effectiveness of community-based support for self-management for patients with diabetes.

Community-based support for self-management and self-directed self-management programmes delivered/supported online, via telephone or app-based may be best used to optimise education as a first-line self-management intervention for diabetic patients in LMICS.

[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] conducted an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis and found that the use of comprehensive patient-centred care (face-to-face individual patient education) significantly reduced the average cost of medicines per patient, frequency of dosage, and insulin doses monthly, with a reduction of 1581 Egyptian pound per 1% HbA1c reduction for patients maintained on the programme for three months compared to usual care. Self-management is evidenced as a useful tool in reducing personal costs and out-of-pocket expenses relating to living with LTCs in LMIC settings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have systematically identified, appraised, and synthesised current evidence regarding outcomes of self-management intervention among patients living with LTCs in LMIC settings. The barriers and facilitators of successful self-management and the feasibility of these interventions were also described. Based on available evidence, profiled self-management interventions led to modest but improved clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. These results are consistent with Lamptey et al.&#x02019;s [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] scoping review. Although there was significant heterogeneity in reporting of the demography of study participants, most studies included patients from a wide array of backgrounds (socio-economic, education, and marital status), and gender. Our findings are therefore applicable to most people in LMICs context though methodological limitations of included primary studies forming the evidence base implies findings must be interpreted with caution.</p><p>As indicated in the evidence base, self-management for diabetes was most prevalent. On one hand this shows increasing awareness of diabetes as a common LTC in LMICs but also shows a huge gap in practice &#x02013; a lack of standardised approach and incorporation of self-management education as a core treatment for all patients living with diabetes in LMICs. Living with one or multiple LTCs is difficult, affecting almost every facet of life for patients and their careers. It is also a long-term sail meaning that supporting people with LTCs on a journey of self-activation will help them feel more in control and live a better life. Though studies reported on disease specific clinical outcomes and quality of life, follow-up reports on these outcomes were non-existent or were of short duration (maximum 12 weeks). Since none of the studies explicitly investigated nor reported on patient activation and readiness to engage in self-management in the longer term, the successes reported in these studies will therefore need to be interpreted with caution.</p><p>In the context of self-management, it is essential to consider both barriers and facilitators of self-care. Despite this review found no studies reporting on self-management of mental health problems as a LTC in LMICs, psychological distress was reported as a major barrier to self-management, but no study reported patients with reported LTCs (<italic>i.e.</italic> diabetes, hypertension, arthritis) having been diagnosed with mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. Given current evidence on the existence (co-morbidity) of anxiety and depression with physical LTCs such as diabetes, hypertension, and musculoskeletal pain in HICs [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], it is highly likely that these mental health problems are being missed among people with LTCs in LMICs. Systematic omission of these evidently compromises vital aspects of person-centred care. Lack of education /awareness among health professionals and development of self-management strategies that incorporate mental and physical health may negatively impact on the health of people living with LTCs and further increase the overall burden in LMICs.</p><p>Overall, the evidence on economic feasibility was scarce. Out of the 26 studies included in our analysis, only one study evaluated the decrease in cost associated with patient self-management interventions. The intervention resulted in reduced medication usage in the future, which was a contributing factor to the financial impact of living with LTCs in a low-resource setting. The paucity of reports with standardised cost-effectiveness units (<italic>e.g.</italic> cost per unit of Hba1c improvement) hindered attempts at comparison across different self-management interventions. Careful investments in self-management interventions could potentially reduce further unnecessary health care utilisation in already over-stretched health systems.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This review provides a summary of the current evidence on the effectiveness, facilitators, and barriers of self-management of LTCs in LMICs, drawing together, for the first time, findings from the most common LTCs <italic>i.e.</italic> diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. Other strengths of this review include a comprehensive search of the literature, an evidence synthesis incorporating all available evidence (experimental and qualitative studies) and conducted in line with robust systematic review methodology.</p><p>However, there are also limitations to our study. Large heterogeneity in study design and reporting from primary studies precluded intended statistical pooling meta-analysis and grading of evidence. There are currently no core outcomes set for evaluating self-management programmes with cultural sensitivities in LMICs. This is needed to facilitate robust methodological evaluation and inform policy and clinical decision-making. Future research should also investigate the cost-effectiveness of self-management interventions using quantitative and standard units like cost per percentage improvement in biological markers (<italic>e.g.</italic> mmHg) or dollars per life-year gained.</p><p>The minimal age of 45 years in our eligibility criteria also implied that some evidence of self-management interventions in LMICs among younger patients was not represented in this review. Given factors such as literacy, self-efficacy, motivation and increasing use of mobile technology in LMICs, approaches to self-management interventions which will be readily feasible, successful and scalable among younger populations with LTCs are likely to be different to those of older populations. This is an important focus for future primary research and systematic review of evidence from LMICs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Self-management education and advice shows promise for improving outcomes for people with common LTCs in LMICs. mHealth-guided self-management and community-based support are best used as a complementary approach to optimising care. Beyond diabetes and hypertension, further intervention development and implementation studies on self-management in LMICs (including mental health and musculoskeletal health self-management protocols) are warranted but there needs to be first an agreement and specification of core-outcomes set for evaluating self-management interventions among people living with LTCs in LMICs. There is a need for regulatory bodies to develop clinical guidelines and promote implementation of tailored self-management education as a core management strategy tailored for LTCs care in LMICs.</p><p>Support initiatives to improve access to reliable health care information through education and advice should be seen as a basic fundamental right of every patient. This is especially true for patients living with LTCs in LMICs. This will combat myths and misinformation, uninformed practices that could further lead to deterioration/poorer health and quality of life outcomes. Ensuring that health workers have access to reliable health care information and have sufficient time in consultations to do so should be a moral obligation of government and regulatory bodies involved in provision of health care services. For instance, there is currently no clinical practice guideline on the management of multiple LTCs in LMICs. Given that most LTCs share similar risk factors, adopting a person-cantered care approach with conscientiously developed self-management education and advise as a core management is a first step. This will need to be closely followed by proper implementation plan to deliver this at the grassroots level across health systems parastatals in LMICs. One of such infrastructures that could be employed is community-based LTC management centres to empower patients with knowledge for improving their health and QoL outcomes. Here, culturally appropriate practical workshops and creative learning can easily be implemented to promote knowledge and patient activation for self-management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional material</title><supplementary-material id="S1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>
