Although studies have shown the importance of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metabolic reprogramming during cancer metastasis, the link between EMT and metabolic reprogramming, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms by which both mediate cancer cell invasion and metastasis have not been elucidated. Here, we observed that interactions between platelets and cancer cells promote the secretion of TGF-&#x003b2;, thereby initiating EMT, promoting the invasion, and altering the metastatic and metabolic potential of colon cancer cells. TGF-&#x003b2; activates the AKT signaling pathway to enhance HK1 and HK2 expression in cancer cells, leading to increased glucose consumption, ATP production, and precise modulation of cell cycle distribution. In an energy-deficient model induced by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibition with oligomycin A, TGF-&#x003b2;-induced highly metastatic HCT116 (H-HCT116) cells adapt by upregulating HK expression and glycolytic metabolism, while concurrently decreasing cell proliferation to conserve energy for survival. Mechanistically, H-HCT116 cells regulate cell division rates by downregulating CDK2, CDK4, and Cyclin D1 protein expression and upregulating p21 expression. Furthermore, H-HCT116 cells display enhanced motility, which is linked to increased mitochondrial metabolic activity. These findings indicated that cancer cells-platelets interaction secreted TGF-&#x003b2; activates cancer metastasis potential by inducing metabolic reprogramming and bioenergetic adaptation. The present study provides new insights into the adaptive strategies of highly metastatic cancer cells under adverse conditions and indicates that targeting glycolysis and metabolic reprogramming could serve as a viable approach to prevent cancer metastasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cancer metastasis</kwd><kwd>platelet-cancer cells interaction</kwd><kwd>transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;)</kwd><kwd>metabolic reprogramming</kwd><kwd>bioenergetic adaptation</kwd><kwd>epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="Section1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Cancer is a significant challenge to the world's public health, with about 20 million new cases to be diagnosed and 9.7 million deaths attributable to the disease in 2022 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. The metastatic spread of cancer remains the primary cause of mortality among patients and poses a significant obstacle in advancing cancer management <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies and the main cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. At the time of diagnosis, a significant number of patients have already progressed to the stage of tumor cell metastasis, and approximately 50% of CRC patients experiencing distant metastases <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Despite the advancements in therapeutic options that have enhanced the prognosis of patients with CRC, a majority of cancer survivors still face an unfavorable outcome primarily due to metastasis. Hence, it is imperative to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying colon cancer metastasis and devise preventive strategies.</p><p>Extensive evidence indicated that platelet plays an important role in the process of metastasis, as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) evade immune surveillance through interactions with platelets, thereby facilitating their survival and subsequent metastatic dissemination <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Furthermore, activated platelet release of transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) enhance cancer metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that facilitates cancer cell extravasation and tissue invasion <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. EMT represents a key transformation where cells lose epithelial features and gain mesenchymal and stem cell-like characteristics, which enhance invasiveness <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. TGF-&#x003b2; signaling can induce EMT through Smads and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, thereby activating EMT transcription factors <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. The active involvement of PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in promoting invasion by metastatic cancer cells has been extensively researched, including the regulation of EMT-related proteins (such as E-cadherin) and transcription factors <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p><p>Metabolic reprogramming is one of the hallmarks of cancer, and plays a crucial role in regulating the survival and metastasis of cancer cells <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Cancer cells usually require much more energy than normal cells to sustain their rapid proliferation. The cell primarily relies on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis as its main energy metabolism pathways <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. The majority of cancer cells exhibit a high rate of glycolysis, which not only compensates for the increased demand for adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), but also contributes to cell proliferation and survival by modulating signaling pathways and enhancing the biosynthesis of macromolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids and lipids <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. The first key enzymes in glycolysis, known as hexokinases (HK), are essential kinases that converts glucose into glucose 6-phosphate <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Under the influence of an altered cancer microenvironment, metabolic reprogramming facilitates the adaptation of cancer cells to sustain aggressive growth and metastasis through efficient energy acquisition <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Although studies have shown the importance of EMT and metabolic reprogramming during cancer metastasis, the link between EMT and metabolic reprogramming, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms by which both mediate cancer cell invasion and metastasis have not been elucidated.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the effects of TGF-&#x003b2; on the cancer cell migration activity, metabolic potential, and proliferation rate. Additionally, we examined the ability of TGF-&#x003b2;-induced high-metastatic cancer cells to adapt to extreme environments (such as inhibition of OXPHOS) and their stress response ability. By exploring the molecular mechanisms of TGF-&#x003b2;-induced metabolic reprogramming and bioenergetic adaptation, this study aims to provide new insights into the adaptive strategies of highly metastatic cancer cells in challenging microenvironments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human colorectal cancer cell lines HT29, HCT116, and LoVo were obtained from the Shanghai Cell Bank, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In contrast, the TGF-&#x003b2; levels in the control group, which consisted of platelet-poor plasma (PPP), were approximately 300 pg/mL. Additionally, our results demonstrate that platelets significantly upregulate pSmad expression in HT29 cells compared to the control group (<bold><xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>B</bold>). These findings suggest that platelets enhance the EMT and metastasis of cancer cells through the secretion of TGF-&#x003b2;, which activates pSmad expression.</p></sec><sec><title>TGF-&#x003b2; promotes the invasiveness and metastatic potential of colorectal cancer cells by inducing EMT</title><p>The EMT is a dynamic process involved in cancer metastasis, characterized by the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype and a reduction in intercellular adhesion, which enhances cellular motility <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Numerous studies have established that TGF-&#x003b2; is a key regulator of EMT, and models of TGF-&#x003b2;-induced EMT have been applied across various cancer types <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. In our experiments, we observed that TGF-&#x003b2; treatment induces EMT in colon cancer cell lines (HT29, LoVo, HCT116) compared to untreated controls. Detailed microscopic analysis of TGF-&#x003b2;-treated cells, as shown in <bold>Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A and <xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>A</bold>, revealed that after 24 hours, these cells began to exhibit mesenchymal characteristics. After seven days of exposure to TGF-&#x003b2;, we noted the emergence of spindle-shaped cells with increased pseudopodia formation and larger intercellular spaces.</p><p>To confirm TGF-&#x003b2;'s role in EMT activation, we examined the expression of EMT-related mRNA in HT29, HCT116 and LoVo cells using qRT-PCR for various time periods. The results are shown in <bold>Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B</bold>, treatment with TGF-&#x003b2; led to a significant time-dependent upregulation of HK1, HK2, HIF1, FN1, VIM, ZEB1, SNAIL2, and TWIST mRNA levels of HCT116 cells compared to the control group. Similarly, when exposure of HT29 and LoVo cells to TGF-&#x003b2; for 7 days resulted in a remarkable increase in HK1, HK2, HIF1, FN1, VIM, ZEB1, ZEB2 and SNAIL2 mRNA levels (<bold><xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>B and 2C</bold>). These findings suggest that TGF-&#x003b2; promotes EMT by upregulating mRNA levels of key EMT-inducing factors. Additionally, we examined the effect of TGF-&#x003b2; on aggressive behaviors of HT29 and HCT116 cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. The transwell assay showed that TGF-&#x003b2; obviously increased the invasion of HCT116 and HT29 cells in a time-dependent manner when compared to untreated controls (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C</bold> and<bold>
<xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure 3</xref></bold>). These results highlight TGF-&#x003b2;'s role in driving cancer progression through the induction of EMT, which enhances cellular invasiveness and the potential for metastasis.</p><p>We also analyzed the effect of TGF-&#x003b2; on the cell cycle distribution of HCT116 cells. As shown in <bold>Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></bold>, TGF-&#x003b2; treatment resulted in a slight increase in the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase, while the proportion of cells in the mitotic phases (S and G2/M) decreased slightly. After prolonged TGF-&#x003b2; treatment (more than five days), the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase stabilized at around 65%, showing little variation over time. These findings indicate that TGF-&#x003b2; modulates the cell cycle to adapt to the cancer microenvironment, maintaining a balance between proliferation and migration. Collectively, these results strongly support the notion that TGF-&#x003b2; is crucial in regulating the cell cycle and acts as a driving force in cancer metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>TGF-&#x003b2; enhances glucose consumption and ATP synthesis through the activation of AKT signaling pathways in cancer cells</title><p>Metastasis requires enhanced invasiveness from cancer cells, which significantly raises their energy demands compared to normal cells. This phenomenon, known as the "Warburg effect," was first described by Otto Warburg in the 1920s and has since become a well-established concept in cancer biology <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Building on this foundation, we investigated how TGF-&#x003b2; influences intracellular glucose consumption and ATP production in cancer cells. Using a glucose assay kit, we measured glucose uptake in HT29 and HCT116 cells after TGF-&#x003b2; treatment. As shown in <bold>Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A-C</bold>, TGF-&#x003b2; significantly enhanced glucose consumption in both cell lines. Interestingly, a 24-hour exposure of HCT116 cells to TGF-&#x003b2; led to a concentration-dependent rise in ATP levels, peaking at 10 ng/mL. Beyond this concentration, ATP levels began to decline, suggesting possible cytotoxic effects at higher TGF-&#x003b2; levels (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D</bold>). Consequently, we selected 10 ng/mL for subsequent experiments. At this concentration, TGF-&#x003b2; significantly raised ATP levels in both HCT116 and HT29 cells after 12 hours, sustaining high ATP synthesis over time (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E-F</bold>). These observations indicate that TGF-&#x003b2; may induce metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells, resulting in enhanced glucose consumption and ATP production.</p><p>Cancer cells predominantly generate ATP via aerobic glycolysis within mitochondria, which supports various cellular activities <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. Hexokinase (HK) is the first enzyme in glycolysis, catalyzing glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, thus playing a crucial role in regulating glucose phosphorylation <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. There are four subtypes of HK, namely HK1, HK2, HK3 and HK4, among which HK1 and HK2 play a role as drivers of cancer cell glycolysis <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. Recent studies indicate that AKT plays an important role in regulating the expression of HK1 and HK2 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. In current study, we found that the mRNA transcriptional levels of HK1 and HK2 in HT29, LoVo, and HCT116 cells after TGF-&#x003b2; treatment were significantly higher than those in normal cells without TGF-&#x003b2; treatment (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B</bold> and <bold><xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>B-C</bold>). Furthermore, the administration of TGF-&#x003b2; resulted in an elevation in the ratios of p-AKT/AKT in HCT116 cells compared to those observed in the control group (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>G-I</bold>). These findings suggest that TGF-&#x003b2; upregulates HK1 and HK2 expression via AKT pathway activation, which may drive enhanced glycolysis and ATP synthesis in cancer cells (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>J</bold>).</p></sec><sec><title>TGF-&#x003b2;-induced highly metastatic HCT116 cells exhibit increased bioenergetic potential and environmental adaptability</title><p>Our previous study demonstrated that TGF-&#x003b2; induces EMT in colon cancer cells, increasing their metastatic potential. Additionally, TGF-&#x003b2; enhances metabolic activity and modulates proliferation rates, which may improve the environmental adaptability and survival of TGF-&#x003b2;-induced metastatic cancer cells. To explore these effects, we compared the stress responses of TGF-&#x003b2;-induced highly metastatic HCT116 cells (H-HCT116) and untreated HCT116 cells under energy-limited conditions by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) with oligomycin A.</p><p>Under normal oxygen levels (20%), untreated HCT116 cells exhibited a rapid drop in ATP levels after oligomycin A treatment (1 &#x003bc;M), with ATP levels declining to 20% of the baseline within 24 hours (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A</bold>). In contrast, H-HCT116 cells showed only a gradual reduction in ATP levels within the first six hours of oligomycin A treatment, maintaining approximately 60% of baseline levels. Notably, after this initial drop, ATP levels in H-HCT116 cells began to increase, nearly returning to baseline after 24 hours. These findings suggest that H-HCT116 cells may rapidly activate alternative energy pathways, such as glycolysis, to compensate for energy deficits when OXPHOS is inhibited by oligomycin A.</p><p>In hypoxic conditions (5% oxygen), ATP levels in untreated HCT116 cells decreased to 50% of baseline following oligomycin A exposure. After 12 hours, ATP levels in these cells began to recover, eventually returning to normal (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B</bold>). In H-HCT116 cells, however, ATP levels did not decline with oligomycin A treatment but instead showed a steady increase, reaching nearly double the baseline by 24 hours. These findings suggest that in low-oxygen conditions, HCT116 cells primarily rely on glycolysis due to reduced OXPHOS, limiting oligomycin A's effect. H-HCT116 cells, however, demonstrate an enhanced capacity to upregulate alternative energy pathways, leading to a substantial boost in energy production. These results suggest that TGF-&#x003b2;-induced H-HCT116 cells possess increased adaptability to harsh microenvironments and can dynamically adjust metabolic processes in response to energy limitations.</p><p>We further examined the effect of OXPHOS inhibition by oligomycin A on cell cycle distribution in H-HCT116 and untreated HCT116 cells. While oligomycin A significantly reduced ATP levels in HCT116 cells, it led to an increase in the proportion of cells in the division phase (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C</bold>). In contrast, prolonged exposure to oligomycin A in H-HCT116 cells resulted in a gradual increase in the G0/G1 phase population, with a corresponding decrease in cells undergoing division (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D-F</bold>). These findings indicate that, under energy constraints, H-HCT116 cells may reduce proliferation rates to conserve energy for survival, effectively maintaining viability. Collectively, these observations suggest that H-HCT116 cells have an enhanced ability to regulate the balance between survival and proliferation in response to environmental stressors.</p></sec><sec><title>TGF-&#x003b2;-induced highly metastatic HCT116 cells exhibit activated hexokinase expression and inhibited cyclin expression in the presence of OXPHOS inhibition</title><p>To clarify the mechanisms that enhance the adaptability and metabolic capacity of H-HCT116 in energy-limited environments, we examined changes in the protein levels of hexokinase isoforms HK1 and HK2 following oligomycin A treatment. As shown in <bold>Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A</bold>, untreated HCT116 cells displayed a reduction in HK1 and HK2 expression over time with oligomycin A exposure. Conversely, H-HCT116 cells exhibited a gradual increase in both proteins initially, with HK2 levels declining only after 48 hours (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B-C</bold>). These protein expression patterns align with previous observations of TGF-&#x003b2;-induced upregulation of HK mRNA (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B</bold> and <bold><xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure 2</xref></bold>) and intracellular ATP maintenance (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A-B</bold>). These findings suggest that TGF-&#x003b2;-induced H-HCT116 cells can upregulate HK expression and glycolytic metabolism, thereby compensating for the reduced energy production from impaired OXPHOS.</p><p>We further investigated the expression changes of cell cycle switch proteins and regulatory proteins following treatment with oligomycin A. The results revealed that the expression patterns of cell cycle switch proteins pRB (S795), pChk1 and pChk2 in both HCT116 and H-HCT116 cells were similar upon exposure to oligomycin A (<bold><xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>A-C</bold>). The expression of pRB (S807/811) initially increased in H-HCT116 cells, followed by a subsequent decrease, aligning with the trend observed in HCT116 cells (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D</bold>). Conversely, the expression levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins CDK2, CDK4 and Cyclin D1 increased in HCT116 cells but decreased in H-HCT116 cells after oligomycin A treatment (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E-G</bold>). The expression levels of CDK6, Cyclin D3 and P27 in both HCT116 and H-HCT116 cells remained consistent upon exposure to oligomycin A (<bold><xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>D-F</bold>). Additionally, while P21 expressions decreased in untreated HCT116 cells, they were upregulated in H-HCT116 cells (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>H</bold>). It is known that phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB) promotes cell cycle progression from the G0 phase <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, while the phosphorylation of Chk (pChk) promotes the closure of G2/M phase <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. The increased expression of CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin D3 promotes cell division, while the increased expression of p18, p21, p27 inhibits cell division <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>-<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>. Our results indicate that TGF-&#x003b2;-induced H-HCT116 cells modulate cell division rates by suppressing CDK2, CDK4, and Cyclin D1 expression while enhancing p21 expression under conditions of limited energy (such as OXPHOS inhibition). These adaptations allow H-HCT116 cells to conserve energy, indicating an advanced survival mechanism in resource-scarce conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>TGF-&#x003b2;-induced highly metastatic HCT116 cells exhibit enhanced cellular deformation and motility in the presence of OXPHOS inhibition</title><p>Using immunofluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we visualized the distribution of mitochondria and cytoskeleton components in both HCT116 and TGF-&#x003b2;-induced metastatic H-HCT116 cells after oligomycin A treatment. In untreated HCT116 cells, F-actin (green, Alexa Fluor 488-labeled) displayed a regular, even distribution, forming an oval or spherical shape with a smooth surface. Mitochondria (red) showed a linear arrangement, indicating organized mitochondrial metabolism (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A</bold>). Upon oligomycin A treatment, the F-actin distribution in HCT116 cells remained largely unchanged, while the mitochondrial arrangement shifted from linear to punctate, reflecting a reduction in mitochondrial activity (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B</bold>). In contrast, H-HCT116 cells demonstrated a fusiform or fibrous shape with pseudopodia extensions and a denser distribution of F-actin. Their mitochondria were arranged in linear structures within the cell (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C</bold>). After 24 hours of oligomycin A exposure, H-HCT116 cells adopted a more elongated shape, with densely concentrated F-actin in the pseudopodia, and a subset of mitochondria transitioned from linear to granular structures (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D</bold>). These observations indicate that H-HCT116 cells exhibit a mesenchymal morphology, with abundant F-actin density in pseudopodia, which supports their increased motility and invasive capacity. While most mitochondria in untreated HCT116 cells displayed low metabolic activity (small, grain-like shapes), H-HCT116 cells retained active mitochondrial regions despite oligomycin A exposure, highlighting their enhanced resilience to the inhibitory effects on oxidative phosphorylation. These findings suggest that TGF-&#x003b2;-induced highly metastatic HCT116 cells can maintain mitochondrial activity and cytoskeletal dynamics under metabolic stress, facilitating their motility and invasiveness.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present studies have observed that interactions between platelets and CTCs promote TGF-&#x003b2; secretion, which subsequently induces pSmad expression in CTCs. TGF-&#x003b2; also activates the AKT signaling pathway in CTCs, driving the expression of HK1 and HK2 and triggering EMT. Together, these effects enhance metabolic reprogramming, modulate cell cycle progression, and increase the metastatic potential of CTCs. Notably, TGF-&#x003b2;-induced highly metastatic HCT116 (H-HCT116) cells can adapt to compromised OXPHOS by upregulating HK expression and shifting toward glycolytic metabolism. Concurrently, these cells limit proliferation rates through the downregulation of CDK2, CDK4, and Cyclin D1, while upregulating p21 to conserve energy for survival. These observations underscore that TGF-&#x003b2;, secreted through CTCs-platelet interactions, enhances cancer metastasis by driving metabolic reprogramming and bioenergetic adaptation (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></bold>).</p><p>EMT involves a loss of epithelial characteristics and a shift toward mesenchymal phenotypes <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, thereby significantly increasing cell migration and invasion potential undergo metabolic shifts, particularly with glycolysis being markedly activated (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></bold>). Compared to oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis can quickly generate substantial energy, supporting the survival and proliferation of cancer cells during metastasis. Under conditions of energy stress, cancer cells further increase glycolytic activity to meet energy demands (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A-B</bold>). Research indicates that increased glycolysis can reinforce EMT, creating a positive feedback loop <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. Both EMT and glycolysis are by signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT and HIF-1&#x003b1;, whose activation facilitates both processes (<bold>Figures <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></bold>).</p><p>While the study focuses on colon cancer, the observed mechanisms&#x02014;platelet-CTCs interactions promoting TGF-&#x003b2; release and subsequent pSmad activation&#x02014;may have broader implications across various cancer types. Many cancers rely on similar pathways to enhance metastasis, evade immune responses, and adapt to the blood microenvironment. Thus, elucidating these interactions in colon cancer could potentially offer insights into metastatic processes in other solid tumors, such as breast, lung, and pancreatic cancers, where TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and platelet-tumor cell interactions are also critical.</p><p>Metabolic reprogramming is the adaptive modification of cancer cell metabolism, marked by a shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis, enabling rapid energy production <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>. As EMT enhances cell migration and additional energy demands met by metabolic reprogramming, especially via elevated glycolytic activity. Our findings demonstrate that TGF-&#x003b2; activates Smad and PI3K/AKT pathways, simultaneously driving EMT and metabolic reprogramming (<bold>Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figures 1</xref>-3</bold>). EMT, in turn, promotes metabolic reprogramming by altering intracellular metabolic conditions, while the metabolic shift fuels EMT by supplying energy and biosynthetic precursors.

Platelet-CTCs interactions lead to the secretion of TGF-&#x003b2;, which triggers the activation of PI3K-AKT and Smad signaling pathways, thereby inducing EMT in HCT116 cells (depicted in the blue section), ultimately transforming them into highly metastatic HCT116 (H-HCT116) cells (depicted in the pink section). On the one hand, TGF-&#x003b2; stimulates the expression of HK1 and HK2 in CTCs by activating the AKT signaling pathway, inducing metabolic reprogramming in them. H-HCT116 cells can compensate for impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) energy supply caused by oligomycin A treatment by upregulating HK expression and glycolytic metabolism. On the other hand, H-HCT116 cells regulate the rate of cell division by downregulating the expression of CDK2, CDK4, and Cyclin D1 proteins while upregulating the expression of p21. This reduces cell proliferation to conserve energy for survival when OXPHOS is inhibited by oligomycin A.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcav16p1310g007" position="float"/></fig></floats-group></article>
