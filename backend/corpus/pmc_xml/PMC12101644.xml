</self-uri><abstract><p>Numerous studies have highlighted the anti-cancer effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study focuses on elucidating the impact of the NSAID ibuprofen (IBU) on cancer cells exposed to hypoxia, as the hypoxic microenvironment significantly influences tumor progression, metastatic potential, and therapy resistance. Given that carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a key hypoxia-associated protein and a promising therapeutic target due to its tumor-specific expression, we primarily examined the impact of IBU on CA IX and the transcription factors regulating CA IX expression. We found that IBU downregulates expression and protein level of CA IX in hypoxic colon carcinoma and head and neck cancer cells, resulting in a reduction of membranous CA IX. To elucidate the mechanism of this phenomenon, we analyzed the key CA IX-regulating transcription factor HIF-1 and found decreased levels of the HIF-1&#x003b1; subunit in IBU-treated cells, leading to its impaired binding to the <italic toggle="yes">CA9</italic> promotor. Analysis of another transcription factor involved in CA IX expression, NF&#x003ba;B, showed suppressed NF&#x003ba;B pathway under IBU treatment. Moreover, we demonstrated IBU-mediated induction in apoptosis in cancer cells, as well as a decrease in their ability to migrate. Our study is the first to demonstrate that ibuprofen downregulates carbonic anhydrase IX expression in hypoxic colon and head and neck tumor cells by decreasing HIF-1&#x003b1; levels. Additionally, ibuprofen impairs key transcription factors NF&#x003ba;B and STAT3, leading to reduced adaptation to hypoxic stress, decreased tumor cell viability, and migration. This indicates its potential as a therapeutic agent in combination therapy for colon carcinoma or head and neck cancer.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Moreover, several epidemiologic studies have observed that the long-term and regular use of NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin) is associated with reduced risk of various cancer types including prostate [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], colorectal [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], lung [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], breast [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], head and neck [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] or gastric cancers [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In general, NSAIDs block cyclooxygenase (COX)-catalyzed prostaglandin biosynthesis and thus inhibit cellular processes mediated by prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and its receptors such as activation of signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and/or angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. There are two COX isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, and based on COX selectivity, NSAIDs are classified as non-selective and COX-2 selective. Both COX-2 and prostaglandins also play a key role in the generation of the inflammatory response. PGE<sub>2</sub> mediates augmentation of arterial dilatation, increases microvascular permeability resulting in edema and acts on the peripheral sensory neurons causing pain. It also contributes to the development of inflammatory granulation and regulate the function of many cell types including macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, and dendritic cells [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Numerous studies provide evidence that chronic inflammation increases risk of cancer, promotes tumor progression and metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, the key anti-cancer mechanism of NSAIDs is believed to be caused by their anti-inflammatory properties, but it has also been demonstrated that NSAIDs induce cancer cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the exact molecular mechanism of the anti-tumor action of NSAIDs remains unclear.</p><p>One of the key microenvironmental condition that occur in a majority of malignant tumors is hypoxia characterized by low oxygen concentration (between 1%-2% O<sub>2</sub> and lower). Tumor cells in such microenvironment induce a number of signaling pathways allowing them to adapt to the unfavorable conditions. Most of the changes are activated by a crucial survival transcriptional program mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) composed of HIF-1&#x003b1; and HIF-1&#x003b2; subunits. In the presence of oxygen, HIF-1&#x003b1; is hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) and factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) enzymes, which facilitate HIF-1&#x003b1; binding to the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein leading to HIF-1&#x003b1; ubiquitination and degradation. In contrast, under hypoxia, the activity of PHD is inhibited, so HIF-1&#x003b1; accumulates, binds to HIF-1&#x003b2; and activates the transcription of more than 100 direct target genes [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To date, few studies analyzing the effect of NSAIDs on hypoxic-related processes (mainly angiogenesis) have shown that NSAIDs inhibit hypoxia-induced <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> angiogenesis in gastric cells <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> increased expression of VHL leading to reduced accumulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; and its target gene vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, NSAID-treatment of prostate cancer cells resulted in reduced levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; and HIF-2&#x003b1; and down-regulated VEGF and Glut-1 [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Critical for the survival of hypoxic tumor cells is the hypoxia-triggered shift toward glycolytic metabolism resulting in the development of an acidic extracellular microenvironment. Both hypoxia and acidosis are hallmarks of cancer associated with aggressiveness, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. One of the most important hypoxia-induced proteins helping tumor cells adapt to the hostile acidic environment is carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX). It is an enzyme facilitating bicarbonate production for the purpose of intracellular alkalinization. It was shown that CA IX contributes to many aspects of tumor progression such as altered expression of extracellular matrix components [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], reduced cell-cell adhesion, increased migration and invasion [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. CA IX is present in a broad range of tumors and its expression correlates with resistance to conventional therapy and poor prognosis of cancer patients. Moreover, there is accumulating evidence of CA IX presence in non-cancerous diseases linked to hypoxia, for example abdominal aortic aneurysm [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or cirrhosis [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. All these facts indicate that CA IX is a promising biomarker and therapeutic target [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we evaluated the effect of a non-selective NSAID ibuprofen (IBU) on CA IX expression in cell lines derived from various cancer types cultivated as monolayers in hypoxic conditions or in 3D models of spheroids. Since CA IX expression is primarily dependent on the HIF transcription factor [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we also analyzed changes in HIF-1&#x003b1; levels and its binding to the <italic toggle="yes">CA9</italic> promotor after IBU treatment. Moreover, we studied the effect of IBU on major pro-inflammatory transcription factors nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF&#x003ba;B) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), both of which are also involved in regulation of CA IX expression. Finally, we showed IBU-mediated impairment of cancer cell proliferation and migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ibuprofen downregulates carbonic anhydrase IX expression in colon cancer and head and neck cancer cell line monolayers at protein and mRNA level</title><p>To evaluate the effect of IBU on CA IX expression in different cancer cell lines, we treated HCT116, RKO, FaDu, and UM-22A monolayers with 0.5&#x02009;mM and 1&#x02009;mM IBU for 24&#x02009;h or 48&#x02009;h in hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub>).

One strategy to improve drugs transitioning into the clinic is the implementation of three-dimensional (3D) multicellular tumor spheroids that more accurately mimic human solid tumor architecture and biology such as cell-cell interactions, cell-extracellular matrix interactions and local gradients of nutrients, growth factors, secreted factors and oxygen. Additionally, cells in multi-layer tumor spheroids constitute a permeability barrier through which therapeutic agents must penetrate [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Spheroid cells form necrotic, hypoxic or quiescent, and proliferating zones, which differ in oxygen levels and thus naturally create conditions for hypoxia-induced CA IX expression.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of IBU on CA IX expression in 3D models, we analyzed the level of the CA IX protein in HCT116 and FaDu spheroids formed in hanging drops with subsequent treatment with 0.5&#x02009;mM IBU, 1&#x02009;mM IBU or DMSO (as a negative control) for 7 days.

Results showed that ibuprofen induced apoptosis in spheroid cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0323635.g005" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). Moreover, in 1&#x02009;mM IBU-treated spheroids (5th day) we also detected cells positive for 7-AAD. Localization of the 7-AAD signal indicates clusters of late apoptotic/necrotic cells released from the necrotic core (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the effect of IBU on spheroid growth, we measured diameters of individually cultivated HCT116 spheroids treated with 0.5&#x02009;mM or 1&#x02009;mM ibuprofen for 7 days using a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL microscope. Results showed that only 1&#x02009;mM IBU significantly slowed spheroid growth (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>), although examination of spheroids by light microscopy revealed less dense cores of 0.5&#x02009;mM IBU-treated spheroids compared to controls (DMSO-treated spheroids), which could be due to wider necrotic zone within spheroids affected by ibuprofen. In addition, as mentioned above, spheroids treated with 1mM IBU released clusters of cells from the inside (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). To evaluate the invasive capacity of these released cells (assuming that these cells are late-apoptotic or necrotic), we further cultivated the extruded cell clusters and found them unable to adhere and proliferate in monolayer.</p><p>Cancer cell migration is one of the key characteristics that facilitates the dissociation of cancer cells from the primary tumor. Therefore, the migration plays a crucial role in the metastatic cascade. To investigate the functional effect of IBU on cell migration, we used the xCELLigence RTCA instrument to examine the migration status of 1&#x02009;mM IBU-treated HCT116 cells under hypoxia. Data demonstrated slower migration of hypoxic monolayer cells affected by ibuprofen compared to control cells (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>). To analyze the effect of ibuprofen on cell dissemination from spheroids, we used the Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL microscope to observe the vicinity of adhered IBU- and DMSO-treated spheroids and to measure cell migration distance from the spheroid edge. Results presented in <xref rid="pone.0323635.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5H</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0323635.g005" ref-type="fig">5I</xref> show that ibuprofen caused a 24% reduction in cell migration from spheroids on 3rd day of treatment and a 38% (0.5&#x02009;mM IBU) or 44% (1&#x02009;mM IBU) decrease in migration of spheroid cells on 5th day of treatment suggesting that ibuprofen may decrease migration capability of cells from primary tumor.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cancer development is a complex process of selective and adaptive steps involving an extensive cast of molecules and signaling pathways. A solid tumor initially grows as an avascular bulk of cells with limited diffusion of nutrients, oxygen and metabolic waste products from the nearest functional blood vessels. These microenvironmental changes result in regional hypoxia and acidosis that put tumor cells under pressure to select a phenotype capable of activating angiogenesis, enhancing invasiveness and metastatic propensity, and gaining therapeutic resistance [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Carbonic anhydrase IX is one of the most important proteins promoting different phases of cancer development. Its expression is restricted to a few healthy tissues, but it is overexpressed in response to tumor hypoxia in many cancers. CA IX plays a critical role in hypoxia-associated tumor acidosis and development of the metastatic phenotype. Therefore, CA IX represents an attractive and promising target for systemic anticancer therapy [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Two major therapeutic tools are being studied for CA IX targeting: monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors (compounds based on sulfonamide/sulfamates and coumarins), but the aim of many studies is to find novel anti-CA IX therapeutics [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>In our study we analyzed the possible effect of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen on CA IX protein. NSAIDs belong to the most commonly prescribed medications used to relieve pain and to reduce inflammation. Moreover, it has been shown that the long-term and regular use of NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin) is associated with a reduced risk of various cancer types [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although the number of experimental studies investigating the effect of NSAIDs on cancer has increased recently, only few of them focused on monitoring the effects on cancer cells in hypoxic conditions. Thus, in the present study we analyzed the effect of IBU on hypoxic human cancer cell lines representing different types of cancers (colon carcinoma and head and neck cancer). The aim of our study was to find whether ibuprofen influences CA IX in these human cancer cells and if so, reveal the possible mechanism of this effect. The concentration of IBU in <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> studies varies and reaches up to 2.5&#x02009;mM. In the present study we treated four different carcinoma cell lines HCT116, RKO, FaDu and UM-22A with 0.5&#x02009;mM or 1&#x02009;mM ibuprofen, since it has been shown that the peak plasma drug concentration in humans can range from low levels up to 0.73&#x02009;mM [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Hypoxic conditions of treated cells were set not only by incubating monolayers in the hypoxic chamber at 1% O<sub>2</sub>, but in our experiments we also used a 3D model (spheroids) that more accurately mimics the human solid tumor architecture and biology, such as cell-cell interactions, cell-extracellular matrix interactions and local gradients of nutrients, growth factors, secreted factors and oxygen and thus naturally creates hypoxic conditions for HIF-1&#x003b1; stabilization followed by CA IX expression [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our results clearly show that ibuprofen decreased CA IX protein and mRNA levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner in all four examined cell line monolayers (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0323635.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) and also in spheroids formed from HCT116 and FaDu cells (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0323635.g001" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). Since the extracellular domain of human CA IX is extended by a proteoglycan-like region, CA IX PG staining on live cells by flow cytometry allowed us to investigate the level of membranous CA IX (mCA IX). 0.5&#x02009;mM IBU treatment in hypoxia resulted in a decrease in the amount of mCA IX by 8%, 13% and 34% in HCT116, RKO and UM-22A cells respectively, and 1&#x02009;mM IBU decreased mCA IX by 23%, 33% and 61% in HCT116, RKO and UM-22A cells respectively. Similar results were described in an earlier study from our laboratory showing a decrease in mCA IX levels in cells treated with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Interestingly, detection of mCA IX in head and neck cancer cell line FaDu demonstrated that neither concentration of IBU affected the level of mCA IX, although Western blot analysis of whole cell lysate revealed a decrease in total CA IX in IBU-treated FaDu cells (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). More experiments are needed to explain this phenomenon. Taken together, our results show that IBU affects CA IX expression in hypoxic cancer cells.</p><p>To elucidate the mechanism of CA IX downregulation, we analyzed HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in IBU-treated monolayers and spheroids. Since HIF-1 is the primary regulator of CA IX expression in contrast to many other hypoxia-inducible genes, due to hypoxia response element (HRE) localized immediately upstream of the transcription start site in the <italic toggle="yes">CA9</italic> promoter [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], using luciferase reporter assay we demonstrated that ibuprofen reduced <italic toggle="yes">CA9</italic> promoter activation (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Decreased HIF-1 activity under ibuprofen treatment was confirmed by the detection of decreased levels of HIF-1-responsive PDHK1 and LDHA (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). We also showed that IBU caused a reduction in HIF-1&#x003b1; accumulation in IBU-treated hypoxic monolayers and spheroids by Western blot (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0323635.g002" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Our findings are consistent with a 2003 study that found that ibuprofen treatment reduced the levels of transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2 in hypoxic prostatic cancer cell lines PC3 and DU-145 [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Disruption of the HIF-1 pathway by ibuprofen may be the key mechanism of CA IX reduction in treated cells, but to elucidate the possibility of IBU-mediated influence on other important transcription factors/pathways, we analyzed the effect of IBU on STAT3 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF&#x003ba;B).</p><p>Signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (STAT) affects various basic cell functions such as cell growth, survival, differentiation, regeneration, immune response, and cellular respiration. Constitutive activation of STAT3 plays an important role in tumor formation, development, metastasis, and recurrence. Therefore, the STAT3 pathway is a promising target for cancer therapy [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, it was shown that treating DU145 and A2058 tumor cells with a STAT3 inhibitor led to a reduction in HIF-1&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. STAT3 also increases the binding kinetics of HIF-1 on the promoters of HIF-1 target genes including <italic toggle="yes">CA9</italic> and thus STAT3 is involved in the HIF-1-mediated hypoxic transcriptional response [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Investigation of the STAT3 protein in our present study showed that ibuprofen caused a decrease in both the total STAT3 protein and its Y705 phosphorylated form p-STAT3 in HCT116, FaDu and UM-22A cell lines under hypoxic conditions in a dose- and time-dependent manner, indicating STAT3 pathway inhibition (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). This is in line with studies demonstrating celecoxib-mediated inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and ibuprofen- and diclofenac-mediated decrease in the level of phosphorylated STAT3 in glioma cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The NF&#x003ba;B transcription factors (complexes of homo- and heterodimers consisting of the subunits RelA/p65, c-Rel, RelB, p50 and p52) are key regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses. They control the expression of important regulatory genes involved in many critical physiological responses such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Thus NF&#x003ba;B plays a critical pathological role in inflammatory disease including auto immunity and atherosclerosis, as well as in neurodegeneration and cancer. The canonical NF&#x003ba;B pathway is activated after degradation of the specific inhibitor of NF&#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;) followed by the release of NF&#x003ba;B (predominantly the p50/p65 dimer) and its translocation to the nucleus, where it activates the expression of target genes [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Data from studies analyzing effect the of NSAIDs on the NF&#x003ba;B pathway are inconsistent. A study from 2004 showed that NSAIDs differ in their ability to suppress NF&#x003ba;B activation. Their results showed that none of the 11 investigated NSAIDs (including ibuprofen) by themselves activated basal NF&#x003ba;B. However, all NSAIDs inhibited TNF-induced NF&#x003ba;B activation and NF&#x003ba;B-regulated gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. The 50% inhibitory concentration for ibuprofen was 3.49&#x02009;mM [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Studies of Stark&#x02019;s group investigating the effect of aspirin on the NF&#x003ba;B pathway in colorectal cancer cells revealed aspirin-induced I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation followed by NF&#x003ba;B translocation to the nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Further experiments of this group brought evidences that aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs decrease the amount of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; followed by translocation of NF&#x003ba;B to the nucleus, indicating activation of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway, but the transcription of the NF&#x003ba;B target gene ICAM-1 was downregulated. They showed that the studied NSAIDs caused nucleolar compartmentalization of RelA/p65, which caused a reduction in the basal levels of NF&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similar results were demonstrated by a study from 2011, where it was shown that ibuprofen induced both I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation and nuclear localization of NF&#x003ba;B in human colon adenoma cells, however the activation of NF&#x003ba;B target genes (<italic toggle="yes">Bcl-2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">survivin</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">cyclin D1</italic>) was suppressed [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Most of the studies investigating the effects of NSAIDs/ibuprofen on NF&#x003ba;B do not include cancer cells and hypoxic conditions. In our study, we examined the effect of IBU on NF&#x003ba;B p50 and p65 subunits in colon cancer cell lines (HCT116 and RKO) and head and neck cancer cell lines (FaDu and UM-22A) under hypoxia. We showed that 1mM IBU concentration caused a decrease in I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; levels in all four analyzed cell lines suggesting release of NF&#x003ba;B from the I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;/NF&#x003ba;B complex and activation of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway. On the other hand, 1&#x02009;mM IBU also decreased precursor protein p105 in all four cell lines and its proteolytically cleaved p50 subunit in colon cell lines (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). To elucidate NF&#x003ba;B activity, we investigated NF&#x003ba;B target protein survivin and found decreased levels of this protein in IBU treated cells (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), although this downregulation could be also related to an impaired STAT3 pathway. Since nuclear localization of p50 and p65 is necessary for proper NF&#x003ba;B activity, we analyzed nuclear subunit levels and demonstrated impaired p50 and p65 translocation to the nucleus by detecting p50 and p65 in nuclear extracts prepared from untreated and IBU-treated cancer cells under hypoxia (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Importantly, there is accumulating evidence for a direct relationship between glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3&#x003b2;) activity and the NF&#x003ba;B signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. GSK3 is a serine/threonine kinase that was identified as a regulator of glycogen synthesis. Its activity is inhibited through phosphorylation of serine 21 in GSK3&#x003b1; and serine 9 in GSK3&#x003b2;. These serine residues of GSK3 have been previously identified as targets of AKT, a serine/threonine kinase located downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). It was shown that GSK3&#x003b2; inhibition disrupts NF&#x003ba;B-mediated gene transcription in pancreatic cancer [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In our experiments we found that IBU increased the phosphorylation of AKT, leading to increased inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3&#x003b2; at Serine 9 (pS9-GSK3&#x003b2;) (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). These results are in line with a study from 2011, where the authors demonstrate elevated levels of inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3&#x003b2; under IBU treatment, although, in contrast to our results, they show increased translocation of NF&#x003ba;B to the nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Discrepancies in the results regarding NF&#x003ba;B translocation to the nucleus might be explained by the concentrations of IBU used in the studies. In a study from 2011, the authors treated cells with 2.5&#x02009;mM IBU and in our study a maximum of 1&#x02009;mM IBU was examined. Moreover, we investigated the effect of IBU on NF&#x003ba;B in hypoxic conditions, while only normoxic cells were analyzed in the other studies.</p><p>Studies analyzing the relationship between CA IX and COX-2 in colorectal cancer showed co-expression of these proteins and that this CA IX/COX-2 axis enhances malignant features of CRC cells [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Through <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> analysis, we were able to demonstrate that there was no relationship between the expression of the <italic toggle="yes">CA9</italic> and PTGS2 genes in colon carcinoma and head and neck cancer. IBU inhibits the production of prostaglandins by decreasing the activity of the enzymes COX-1 and COX-2, but we also wanted to analyze, if IBU affects COX-2 expression. Interestingly, we found that both IBU concentrations (0.5&#x02009;mM and 1&#x02009;mM) increased COX-2 mRNA and protein levels (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0323635.g004" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Only a few studies have analyzed the level of COX mRNA/protein in NSAID-treated cells. Similar data to ours have been described in a study of celecoxib in rat renal mesangial cells [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and in Lewis Lung Carcinoma [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. COX-2 expression was also induced by IBU in normal human bladder urothelial cell line UROtsa, but not in JIMT-1 (breast ductal adenocarcinoma) cells [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In a study of flufenamic acid, the authors conclude that it shows two opposing effects on COX-2 expression: it induces COX-2 expression in the colon cancer cell line HT-29 and macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, but it conversely inhibits tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;)- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced COX-2 expression. [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. COX-2 expression is mediated by NF&#x003ba;B, but since our results demonstrated an impaired NF&#x003ba;B pathway, we sought an alternative mechanism to explain COX-2 upregulation under IBU treatment. It has been shown that several important pathways, for example PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK, are involved in regulation of COX-2 expression [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. To elucidate the possible role of these pathways in IBU-mediated upregulation of COX-2 expression, we analyzed the levels of phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated ERK1/2 in IBU-treated hypoxic cancer cell lines and confirmed that IBU activated both signaling pathways in a dose- and time- dependent manner (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Moreover, using the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 and ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 we proved that both inhibitors suppressed IBU-mediated basal expression of COX-2 protein in hypoxic HCT116, RKO and UM-22A cells indicating, that both pathways are involved in COX-2 expression. On the other hand, in FaDu cells only ERK1/2 inhibitor decreased the level of IBU-mediated COX-2 expression, which suggest that in this cell line only the MAPK/ERK pathway induces COX-2 (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). A study from 2006 showed that inhibition of GSK3&#x003b2; by SB415286 induced the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein, as well as its activity in gastric cancer cells. In contrast to inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway, inhibitors of ERK1/2 did not alter COX-2 expression in these cells [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Considering our results that show increased inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3&#x003b2; (pSer9-GSK3&#x003b2;) under IBU treatment (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), we suggest that IBU-mediated inhibition of GSK3&#x003b2; influences COX-2 expression in hypoxic colon cancer and head and neck cancer cell lines.</p><p>Since our findings revealed IBU-mediated inhibition of HIF-1&#x003b1;, NF&#x003ba;B and STAT3 transcription factors which are important for cell survival, we further investigated cell autophagy and apoptosis under ibuprofen treatment. Similarly to previous studies on the effect of NSAIDs on cell proliferation, we demonstrated that ibuprofen increased the levels of the apoptotic marker cleaved-PARP and the marker of autophagosomes LC3B-II in a dose- and time-dependent manner in hypoxic cell monolayers (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>), and decreased the level of the anti-apoptotic marker survivin (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Moreover, a higher number of apoptotic cells was also confirmed in the 3D model. HCT116 spheroids cultured in the presence of 1&#x02009;mM ibuprofen for 3 days contained more apoptotic cells than controls. Spheroids cultured in the presence of both 0.5&#x02009;mM and 1&#x02009;mM ibuprofen for 5 days had impaired integrity and clusters of late apoptotic/necrotic cells released from the inside (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). These results are similar to our results obtained in an earlier study where we observed such clusters after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Our findings indicate that ibuprofen-mediated changes in signaling pathways attenuated the ability of cells to adapt to hypoxic conditions and thus promote apoptosis in those cells. This phenomenon could be also related to the reduction of CA IX on the cell surface, since it has been shown, that the level of membranous CA IX decreases during the cell death progress due to increased CA IX ectodomain shedding mediated by disintegrin and metalloproteinase ADAM17 [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Even though we realize that we did not monitor autophagic flux, the increased level of LC3B-II in IBU-treated cells indicate changes in autophagosome formation.</p><p>Migration of cells is one of the crucial factors promoting metastasis. A study by Ferreira et al. (2021) showed that ibuprofen inhibited glioblastoma cell migration [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and similarly, a study by Wynne and Djakiew demonstrated that ibuprofen suppressed cell migration of prostatic cancer PC-3 cells [<xref rid="pone.0323635.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In the present study we investigated migration of HCT116 cells cultured in monolayer under hypoxic conditions. Our data revealed that ibuprofen slowed the migration of treated cells in comparison to controls (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>). Next, we examined the migration of cells from HCT116 spheroids. Our results show that the cells were less capable of migrating from the spheroid when treated with ibuprofen, which also indicates that ibuprofen may decrease the ability of cells to migrate from the primary tumor (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5H</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, our study is the first to show that ibuprofen downregulates carbonic anhydrase IX expression in hypoxic colon and head and neck tumor cells and decreases the level of membranous CA IX on cancer cell surface. Moreover, we proved that this downregulation is mediated by decrease in HIF-1&#x003b1; levels, resulting in impaired HIF-1 binding to the <italic toggle="yes">CA9</italic> promoter. We also demonstrated that ibuprofen impairs other important transcription factors, NF&#x003ba;B and STAT3. This involvement in key hypoxia-related signaling pathways and proteins results in reduced adaptation to hypoxic stress, followed by reduced tumor cell viability and migration (<xref rid="pone.0323635.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Taken together, our data revealed novel mechanisms through which NSAIDs may exert their anti-cancer effects and thus could be considered as therapeutics in colon or head and neck cancer in combination therapy.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0323635.g006"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323635.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism of action of ibuprofen (IBU) on hypoxic cancer cells.</title><p>IBU impairs the STAT3 pathway and downregulates HIF-1&#x003b1; protein leading to impaired HIF-1 binding on the <italic toggle="yes">CA9</italic> promoter. The disruption of CA IX transcription results in a decreased level of CA IX on cancer cell membrane. Additionally, IBU impairs NF&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity by reducing the translocation of p50 and p65 to the nucleus despite decreased I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; level. NF&#x003ba;B-mediated gene transcription is also hindered via inhibition of GSK3&#x003b2;. This involvement in crucial pathways results in apoptosis and autophagy of cancer cells. Our study also proved that despite the fact that IBU inhibits COX-2 activity, it paradoxically upregulates COX-2 expression <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 pathways.

We have demonstrated for the first time, that ibuprofen significantly downregulates the expression of CA IX in these cells. Moreover, we revealed the mechanism of this phenomenon, which involves functional impairment of the key CA IX-regulating transcription factor HIF-1 and also inhibition of NF&#x003ba;B, an additional CA IX-regulating protein. Analysis of IBU-treated hypoxic cancer cell viability revealed increased apoptosis and affected autophagy, resulting in a decreased ability of cells to migrate.</p><p>This study not only enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in NSAID action but also opens new strategies for the development of effective anti-cancer strategies. On the other hand, our results demonstrating a reduction of CA IX on hypoxic cell surfaces indicate a lower concentration of the target for CA IX-directed immunotherapy. Most importantly, our study brings new insight into a clinically relevant scenario that may arise while administering IBU treatment to patients with solid tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Monolayer cell culture and treatment</title><p>Colon carcinoma cells HCT116 (kind gift from RNDr. Borivoj Vojtesek, DrSc. from Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute) and RKO and head and neck cancer cells UM-SCC-22A (designated UM-22A) (kind gifts from Nicolas C.
