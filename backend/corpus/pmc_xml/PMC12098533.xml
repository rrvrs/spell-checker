CARs are modular synthetic antigen receptors integrating the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of an immunoglobulin molecule to the TCR signaling. CARs allow HLA independent, T cell mediated destruction of tumor cells independent of tumor associated-HLA downregulation and survive within the patient as &#x02018;living drug.&#x02019; Here we report a safer approach for engineering alpha beta T cells with anti- CD19-CD28&#x003b6; CAR using self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors for adoptive immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>&#x003b1;&#x003b2; T cells from the peripheral blood (PB) were lentivirally transduced with CAR construct containing hinge domain from CD8&#x003b1;, transmembrane and co-stimulatory domain from CD28 along with signaling domain from CD3&#x003b6; and driven by human UBC promoter. The cells were pre-stimulated through CD3/CD28 beads before lentiviral transduction. Transduction efficiency, fold expansion and phenotype were monitored for the CAR T cells expanded for 10&#x02013;12 days. The antigen-specific tumor-killing capacity of CD19 CAR T cells was assessed against a standard CD19 expressing NALM6 cell lines with a flow cytometry-based assay optimized in the lab.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and conclusion</title><p>We have generated high titer lentiviral vectors of CAR with a titer of 9.85 &#x000b1; 2.2&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> TU/ml (mean &#x000b1; SEM; n=9) generating a transduction efficiency of 27.57 &#x000b1; 2.4%. (n=7) at an MOI of 10 in total T cells. The product got higher CD8+ to CD4+ CAR T cell ratio with preponderance of an effector memory phenotype on day 07 and day 12. The CAR-T cells expanded (148.4 &#x000b1; 29 fold; n=7) in serum free media with very high viability (87.8 &#x000b1; 2.2%; n=7) on day 12. The antitumor functions of CD19 CAR T cells as gauged against percentage lysis of NALM6 cells at a 1:1 ratio is 27.68 &#x000b1; 6.87% drawing up to the release criteria. CAR T cells produced IFN&#x003b3; (11.23 &#x000b1; 1.5%; n=6) and degranulation marker CD107&#x003b1; (34.82 &#x000b1; 2.08%; n=5) in an antigen-specific manner. Furthermore, the sequences of WPRE, GFP, and P2A were removed from the CAR construct to enhance safety.

Despite impressive research in the academia and industries, lack of access and availability to the advanced cell therapies such as CAR cell therapy is a major challenge and remains as an unmet healthcare problem especially in resource limited settings across the world (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and the consequent immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity (ICANs), immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT), and other off-target effects are also some of the limitations of CAR T cell therapies. Although effective, CD28 based CARs tends to generate more inflammatory lymphokines and resulted in ICANS in at least 50% patients with stage 3 and above CRS which translates to more hospitalization cost apart from multiorgan damages (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Together with other investigators, it has been demonstrated that alteration in the receptor configuration at the level of hinge and transmembrane domain remains to be one of the most effective approaches to resolve the challenges of CAR therapy in the clinics. Kochendefer&#x02019;s group reported a significant reduction in toxicity without compromising efficacy when the hinge and transmembrane domain is altered with CD8&#x003b1; instead of CD28 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). An optimized receptor design yielding a highly efficient, less toxic and an affordable CAR therapy is yet to be achieved.</p><p>The protocols established for CAR T cells therapy in the clinical trials are tuned for high yield, antitumor potential, and stable expression of CAR transgene. The process flow of cell-based therapy is cautiously evolving to incorporate and purge accessory reagents and alternative approaches. Conventionally, CAR T cells are generated by viral transduction of the primary T cells from the peripheral blood of the patient with an insert coding for CAR receptor followed by expansion in media containing homeostatic cytokines such as IL-2, IL-15, and IL-7. Serum free/Xeno free media with known chemical composition is being increasingly used to mass produce safe products with reduced batch-to-batch variation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). A safe viral vector and transduction protocol for reducing insertional mutagenesis apart from other unintended toxicities are critical to improve the long-term benefits of CAR therapy. Self-inactivating vector (SIN) vectors are considered as an industry standard across lentiviral vector systems (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Importantly the choice promoter that drives the CAR express determines the level of receptor on the surface. While strong promoters with synthetic or xenogeneic origin drives high-level of expression of the transgene and consequent promoter methylation, can result in gene silencing. Although the promoter choice depends on several factors, human origin promoters such as hUBC had been demonstrated to drive stable transgene expression with minimal methylation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). As surface expression of receptor recognize the target antigen, it is important to understand the cellular dynamics and time kinetics of CAR expression in an ongoing immune response. Protein targets, reporter genes and secondary antibodies that target scFvs were increasingly being used to detect the dynamic surface expression of chimeric antigen receptors (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Of the late, universal antibodies targeting the linker region of the scFv, namely G4S were used to monitor the surface expression. Such reagents also help in enriching and purifying CAR T cells.</p><p>To make safe and medically appropriate CAR therapy available to all the tertiary care hospitals, decentralized academic manufacturing in ambulatory settings is suggested. Although multiple CAR T cell manufacturing workflows with reduced cost of production are established, increased demand and reduced supply is projected to be a challenge across public healthcare soon (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, repurposing of CD19 CAR T cells to treat non-malignant disorders such as autoimmune diseases can further increase the demand for product.</p><p>In this context, we have indigenously optimized cGMP compatible workflow for enhanced safety with T cells expanded in chemically defined media, SIN vector with CAR transgene driven by human UBC promoter. The reduced multiplicity of infection and receptor design to diminish the chance of insertional mutagenesis. Additionally, altered receptor design with hinge derived from CD8&#x003b1; as opposed to CD28 ensure reduced cytokine toxicity without compromising cytokine production and antigen specific tumor lysis capacity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>CD19 expressing NALM6 cell line were purchased from ATCC and cultured in RPMI media with 10% FBS and 1% Penstrep as per ATCC recommendations. CD19 knockout NALM6 cell line were generated at our campus at RGCB using CRISPR/Cas9 approach. HEK 293T purchased from ATCC was used as a producer cell line for lentiviral particles.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Lentiviral production and titration</title><p>The CAR construct employed is a second-generation CAR with a single-chain variable fragment
(scFv) from the FMC63 antibody (Spencer and Raikar Laboratory at Emory University, Atlanta, USA). The scFv is linked to the cytoplasmic domain of CD28 and CD3&#x003b6;, through the CD8&#x003b1; hinge and CD28 transmembrane domain. The complete insert is linked to eGFP by a ribosome skipping domain-P2A. A CAR construct without the scFv is used as control in certain experiments. For generating 3<sup>rd</sup> generation pseudo-lentiviral particles, HEK 293T cells were transfected with transfer plasmid (CAR), packaging plasmids (pRSV-Rev and pMDLg/pRRE) and envelope (pMD2.G) using calcium phosphate method. Pseudovirus were concentrated from the supernatants by ultracentrifugation (26000 rpm for 2 hours) and titered via GFP expression of HEK 293T cells transduced with the virus at various dilutions (1/10,1/100,1/1000 etc.). Dilutions with less than 10% GFP expression were used to calculate the viral titer expressed as transduction unit (TU) per ml using the formula TU/mL = (number of cells transduced x percent fluorescence)/(virus volume in mL) (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">

Peripheral blood was collected from healthy volunteers with informed consent and T cells from the blood were isolated using a T cell negative selection kit (Stem Cell Technologies). Isolated T cells were then stimulated with CD3/CD28 beads (1:1) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the presence of IL-2 (100 IU/ml, Miltenyi Biotech) in the serum-free media (Lymphocyte Growth Medium-3, Lonza). After 48 hours of stimulation, the cells were transduced with CAR lentiviral vector and polybrene (8&#x003bc;g/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) via spinfection. Cells were de-beaded on day +3 with replacement of fresh media. The phenotype of the CAR-T cells was measured on day +7 and day +12.</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><title>Phenotyping and flow cytometry</title><p>Transduction efficiency of CAR was assessed by GFP expression and CD19-PE (ACROBiosystems). CAR-T cells were characterized phenotypically with anti-human antibodies of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD27, CD45RA, and PD-1 by flow cytometry. The antibodies were mixed in FACS buffer (PBS+2%FBS) and added to the cells. After 30 minutes of incubation, cells were washed twice in FACS buffer at 1000rpm for 5 minutes. 7-AAD was used to stain the dead cells. All antibodies and 7-AAD were purchased from BD Biosciences.

Moreover, we restricted the multiplicity of infection of transduction to 10 to reduce the insertion of multiple copies of transgene per cell and the consequent insertional mutagenesis. Moreover, a promoter derived from human UBC (hUBC) ensured reduced gene silencing, which was otherwise a major challenge for the stable long-term expression of CAR transgene (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Although a high-titer virus could be developed, batch to batch variations in transduction efficiency of the pseudo-viral preparation prevented it; however, this can be resolved by producing the virus in a single batch.</p><p>Yeskarta and Breyanzi are the two CAR T cell formulations using CD28 co-stimulatory domains.

In view of reducing the toxicity without compromising efficacy, our CAR design incorporates hinge domain from CD8&#x003b1; and transmembrane domain from the CD28 region (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). We also generated sequence confirmed CAR constructs devoid of WPRE, P2A and GFP with higher transduction efficiency and memory phenotype profile.</p><p>Chemically defined media with xeno-free components is being increasingly used for the expansion of therapeutic immune cells (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). To maintain batch to batch consistency, we used LGM3&#x02122; media (Lonza) that was specially formulated to support lymphocyte growth and devoid of exogenous growth factors and artificial stimulators or undefined supplements. Most of the components used for the expansion such as CD3/CD28 beads, IL-2, polybrene and LGM3&#x02122; media are cGMP compatible.</p><p>CAR T cells generated in our lab proliferated to 150-fold and 87% viability, which is approaching industry standard. The antigen specific expansion of CAR T cells when co-cultured against CD19(+) but not CD19(-) tumor cells indicates the higher on-tumor effect of the CAR T cells. Moreover, this platform would permit us to study the tumor-specific molecular determinants of CAR T cell proliferation. This T cell expansion protocol is enriching the effector memory RA+ population which translates to senescent/exhausted cells. The increased expansion of CD8 compared to CD4 CAR T cells may indicate reduced persistence (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In the CAR T cell subset, there is an enrichment of effector memory population akin to CAR T cells with CD28 co-stimulatory domain (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The lower percentage of central memory T cell populations can be a limitation of this protocol. We have modified the flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity assay in which the cells are stained only after the assay (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This assay will also help us to concurrently monitor the cell death of both T cells and tumor cells. Importantly, there exists a discrepancy between IFN&#x003b3; and CD107a expression. Not all CAR T cells that generates IFN&#x003b3; is lysing the tumor cells. Hence, it is important to check the percentage of IFN&#x003b3; positive and IFN&#x003b3; negative CAR T cells. The percentage of cytotoxicity is equivalent to the percentage of CAR transduction. Therefore, improving the percentage expression by CAR mRNA preparation can enhance cytotoxicity (ongoing work). Selecting the T cell subsets such as stem cell - like memory cells combined with alteration in the receptor configuration is yet another approach (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the CAR T cells which we developed is an indigenous workflow for expanding anti CD19 CAR T cells with hinge region derived from CD8&#x003b1; and transmembrane and co-stimulatory domain derived from CD28 with signaling domain from CD3&#x003b6;. We employed a very safe lentiviral SIN vector with hUBC promoter. Our serum free expansion of CAR T cells has viability, antigen-specific proliferation, tumor killing capacity and cytokine production. We also indigenously generated a cGMP-compatible CAR vector, which is ready for further development as a potential clinical product.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. T.R.
