This disorder is characterized by congenital cerebellar ataxia, intellectual disability, and gait abnormalities [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This disorder is extremely rare, with fewer than 20 previously published cases in the literature [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. All cases of CAMRQ2 that have been reported are consanguineous with autosomal recessive inheritance [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The <italic>WDR81</italic> gene has been found to show some similarity with genes including NSMAF (neutral sphingomyelinase activation associated factor), NBEA (neurobeachin), and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator) [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Previously published cases describe other varying features, including thoracic kyphosis and scoliosis, short stature, absent or limited speech, intention tremor, coarse facial features, hirsutism, strabismus, wide and short neck, and small hands and feet [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Findings on brain MRI of previously published cases include cerebellar atrophy, generalized brain atrophy, and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. All previously published cases have occurred in consanguineous families, and the majority of affected individuals ambulated with a quadrupedal gait [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Here, we describe a case report of a more mildly affected female with bipedal gait from a nonconsanguineous family, expanding the phenotype of this rare disorder.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>The patient was twin A of a dizygotic-diamniotic pregnancy, born at 37 6/7 weeks to a 26-year-old G1P0 mother who received regular prenatal care.&#x000a0;She was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to hypoglycemia and vomiting. The NICU course included a neurology consult for apneic episodes and concern for subclinical seizures.&#x000a0;Head ultrasound reported multiple punctate echogenic foci in the basal ganglia bilaterally, but no structural abnormalities were reported on brain MRI at five days of age. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was normal in the NICU, and she was discharged at 10 days of age.&#x000a0;Her family developed concerns for her development around age six months when they noted she was not attaining milestones at the same pace as her fraternal twin.&#x000a0;They noted difficulty with feeding and choking episodes, with the patient requiring the use of a level 1 bottle nipple until she transitioned to solid foods.&#x000a0;She had difficulty sitting unassisted and would often fall to the side.&#x000a0;She began walking at 16-18 months of age but with an unsteady gait and frequent falls. The family also noted a hand tremor when pointing and reaching for objects.&#x000a0;She was evaluated by neurology, and at 18 months of age, she was diagnosed with cerebellar ataxia. Brain MRI reported cerebellar atrophy, most pronounced in the vermis, with ex-vacuo dilation of the fourth ventricle (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Brain MRI findings</title><p>Brain MRI shows cerebellar atrophy, most pronounced in the vermis, with ex-vacuo dilation of the fourth ventricle.

The red arrows depict atrophy of the superior and inferior vermis. Figure C presents sagittal T1 FLAIR view. As shown in this red circle, the cerebellum does fully occupy its allotted space. Figure D presents sagittal T1 post-contrast view.

She is working at grade level in school with tutoring support but without formal academic interventional services.&#x000a0;Family history is negative for similarly affected individuals and consanguinity was denied.</p><p>Results</p><p>The whole exome sequencing trio with subsequent data reanalysis identified a homozygous c.2567 C&#x0003e;T [p.(P856L)] variant in exon 1 of the <italic>WDR81</italic> gene.&#x000a0;Each parent was found to be heterozygous for this variant, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.&#x000a0;</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>T&#x000fc;rkmen et al. (2006), Tan (2006), and Gulsuner et al. (2011) studied a consanguineous Turkish family with five siblings with structural brain abnormalities including cerebellar hypoplasia, severe intellectual disability, limited speech, and quadrupedal ambulation secondary to inability to walk with a bipedal gait [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].&#x000a0;Genome-wide linkage analysis identified a candidate disease locus on chromosome 17p [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].&#x000a0;Ozcelik et al. (2008) confirmed linkage to chromosome 17p13 in the same family [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, in this same family, T&#x000fc;rkmen et al. (2006) discovered a homozygous mutation in the <italic>WDR81</italic> gene (P856L), which segregated from the phenotype and was not present in 549 control subjects [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].<italic>&#x000a0;WDR81</italic> was also found to be highly expressed in the cerebellum and corpus callosum [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. MRI findings presented hypoplasia of the cerebellum and cerebellar vermis, a small nucleus dentatus, and a thin corpus callosum [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Alazami et al. (2015) identified a homozygous missense variant in the <italic>WDR81</italic> gene (G282E) in a patient with hydranencephaly and cerebellar hypoplasia, from a consanguineous family, further supporting an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and the <italic>WDR81</italic> gene&#x02019;s involvement in brain development [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Komara et al. (2016) reported two siblings in a consanguineous Yemeni family with global developmental delay, limited speech, cerebellar hypoplasia, and bipedal ataxic gait [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].&#x000a0;The siblings were found to have a homozygous truncating mutation in the <italic>WDR81</italic> gene (R1333X) by whole-exome sequencing, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and segregated with the phenotype in affected individuals [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Notably, the bipedal ataxic gait in the siblings suggests that although the quadrupedal gait is a common and significant feature in severe cases of CAMRQ2, a broader spectrum of motor phenotypes can be seen [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Genes involved in quadrupedal locomotion include<italic> VLDLR</italic>,<italic> CA8</italic>, and<italic> WDR81.</italic> However, some studies have shown that the <italic>WDR81</italic> gene is not co-expressed with genes such as <italic>VLDLR</italic> and <italic>CA8</italic> [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This raises the possibility that <italic>WDR81</italic> might play a role in a separate developmental regulatory pathway [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>As described above, published cases of CAMRQ2 are characterized by severe intellectual disability including limited or absent speech, with most affected individuals using quadrupedal ambulation secondary to the inability to walk with a bipedal gait [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].&#x000a0;Our patient has a notably milder developmental phenotype.&#x000a0;She has age-appropriate speech skills and a bipedal gait (although with ataxia and frequent falls), and she is able to jump on two feet and dance.&#x000a0;Interestingly, she has the same variant in the <italic>WDR81 </italic>gene (P856L) as in the Turkish family studied [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].&#x000a0;This case underscores the importance of considering <italic>WDR81</italic> mutations even in the absence of consanguinity and severe intellectual disability. Furthermore, the patient&#x02019;s relatively preserved cognitive abilities and age-appropriate speech suggest that early therapeutic interventions, along with environmental factors, may play a critical role in mitigating the severity of the disease. We propose that her early diagnosis and therapeutic interventions have contributed to her milder presentation. This case emphasizes the importance of long-term follow-up to assess the full range of possible outcomes in these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>CAMRQ2 is an extremely rare condition, and our patient demonstrates previously undescribed phenotypic variability with cerebellar ataxia but otherwise age-appropriate development.&#x000a0;This case highlights the importance of iterative genetic testing and shows how gains in information and technology over time can identify rare diagnoses.&#x000a0;In our patient's case, early diagnosis allowed for targeted therapies, such as physical and occupational therapy, which have contributed to a more favorable outcome compared to reported cases of CAMRQ2 presenting with quadrupedal ambulation and severe intellectual disability.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the patient and her family for allowing us to share her story and expand the phenotype of this rare disorder.</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Livia Hochman, Alrick Drummond, Kara Morgan</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Livia Hochman, Alrick Drummond, Kara Morgan</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Livia Hochman</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Livia Hochman, Alrick Drummond, Kara Morgan</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Alrick Drummond, Kara Morgan</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Homozygosity mapping and targeted genomic sequencing reveal the gene responsible for cerebellar hypoplasia and quadrupedal locomotion in a consanguineous kindred</article-title><source>Genome Res</source><person-group>
