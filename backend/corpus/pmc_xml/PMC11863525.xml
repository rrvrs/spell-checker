</p><p id="Par13">On the day of oocyte retrieval (day 15), a transvaginal sonography was performed. The endometrium was thick and measured at 15&#x000a0;mm, and a pregnancy sac with a diameter of 4&#x000a0;mm was observed in the uterus. Thirty-six hours after the trigger, oocyte retrieval was performed with 22 follicles punctured; meanwhile, &#x003b2;HCG was reported as 987 mIU/ml. A total of twelve oocytes were obtained. Of these, five were mature M2 oocytes. Post-intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), these five oocytes were fertilized, resulting in five zygotes denoted as 5(2PN). Subsequently, these zygotes developed into five cleavage-stage embryos with the following grades: 4AB, 4B, 2AB, 2B, and 3B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, six oocytes were identified at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage and subjected to an in vitro maturation (IVM) culture protocol. This IVM process culminated in the maturation of three additional M2 oocytes. Following ICSI, these oocytes were fertilized, yielding three zygotes (3(2PN)) and subsequently three embryos with the grades 8AB, 8AB, and 8BC. However, three oocytes within the GV-stage group failed to reach maturation, and one oocyte was non-viable post-retrieval. Ultimately, eight cleavage stage embryos were cryopreserved. On the day of retrieval, suction curettage was performed to terminate the pregnancy due to the necessity for chemotherapy and the prohibition of continuing the pregnancy. Three hours post-procedure, the patient was discharged from the institute without any complications. And chemotherapy was started. Eight days post-curettage, &#x003b2;HCG levels returned to negative.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par14">The random start ovarian stimulation protocol is employed for oocyte and embryo cryopreservation for fertility preservation in cancer patients who lack sufficient time to perform routine ovarian stimulation at the onset of the menstrual cycle. This protocol can be executed at any point during the cycle. Evidence suggests that the random start protocol offered to cancer patients shares a similar outlook as conventional IVF methods. According to a study conducted by Koang et al., the pregnancy rate following stimulation initiation in the luteal phase is akin to stimulation initiation in the early follicular phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that the clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and live birth rate (LBR) were identical following follicular and luteal phase stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">The required drug dose for stimulation in the luteal phase is slightly higher than when starting at the beginning of the follicular phase. To mitigate increased estrogen concentration during the ovulation stimulation cycle, it is recommended to add aromatase inhibitors like letrozole at the beginning of the stimulation cycle in estrogen sensitive cancers such as breast cancer and endometrial adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">One of the recommended regimens in random start ovarian stimulation is the use of progestins, a protocol known as Progesterone Primed Ovarian Stimulation (PPOS). Progesterone, a crucial regulator during ovulation, can be utilized in lieu of GnRH antagonist to prevent premature luteinization. When progestins are prescribed in the early stages of the cycle, prior to an increase in estrogen, they suppress GnRH secretion in the hypothalamus. It has been demonstrated that LH levels exhibit greater stability with PPOS. However, due to premature exposure to progesterone and the resultant asynchrony between embryo growth and endometrial receptivity, embryos obtained in that cycle are not transferred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This protocol is deemed appropriate in scenarios where embryo transfer is not necessary, including ovarian stimulation in egg donors, fertility preservation, and cycles that necessitate preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The majority of studies indicate that outcomes related to ovulation response, such as the gonadotropin dose, the number of retrieved oocytes, and the mature (M2) oocytes count, are comparable between the PPOS protocol and GnRH agonist cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In a meta-analysis conducted by Guan et al., it was shown that the CPR, LBR, and ongoing pregnancy rate were comparable in the PPOS protocol relative to other ovulation cycles. The PPOS protocol also reduces the likelihood of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) occurrence in patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), both in the follicular and luteal phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Due to better control of LH concentration, lower drug costs, easier administration (oral), and comparable pregnancy and neonatal outcomes with regular cycles, PPOS has been considered as a flexible protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In a randomized clinical trial, the PPOS protocol was unexpectedly associated with a reduced LBR in comparison to cycles using a GnRH antagonist protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this case, given the temporal limitations, a random start protocol was employed to expedite ovulation induction. Notably, the inadvertent conception and the resultant elevation in progesterone levels paralleled the physiological responses observed in PPOS cycles, thereby fulfilling the intended benefits of the protocol.</p><p id="Par17">We postulate that in the aforementioned patient, the elevated level of endogenous progesterone following pregnancy led to the suppression of FSH and LH. Consequently, the dose of gonadotropin used in the ovulation stimulation cycle was increased. In PPOS cycles, high progesterone levels contribute to better LH stability, and it appears that the increase in endogenous progesterone has played a role in enhancing the quality of oocytes and embryos through this mechanism. Additionally, the risk of OHSS in PPOS cycles is lower, and our patient, despite having a high AFC and AMH equal to 5.3 ng/ml, did not develop OHSS due to receiving a high dose of gonadotropin through this mechanism. Moreover, elevated HCG levels can increase the risk of OHSS. A case of OHSS following a PPOS cycle due to an ectopic pregnancy during ovarian stimulation has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In our patient, HCG levels were found to be low. We undertook the actions of simultaneous pregnancy termination and oocyte retrieval in the presence of elevated progesterone levels, which successfully prevented the development of OHSS. One of the risk factors for OHSS in oncology patients is the use of long-acting GnRH agonists recommended prior to initiating chemotherapy. The administration of these agonists with a short interval following oocyte retrieval is intended to suppress the menstrual cycle and offer ovarian protection. However, this can lead to an increase in FSH, LH, and estradiol levels, which can mimic the physiological effects of HCG, thereby potentially precipitating OHSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It seems plausible that if future studies can independently confirm the sufficiency of endogenous progesterone in controlling LH surge under these conditions, eliminating antagonist in ovulation stimulation cycle will be both patient-friendly and cost-effective.</p><p id="Par18">The presence of a measurable level of HCG at the beginning of the ovulation stimulation cycle presents a challenging issue. The increasing interest in the role of HCG on oocyte quality has stemmed from case reports on unintentional stimulation in previous pregnancies. The impact of HCG on oocyte quality remains a contentious issue. Some studies have suggested that HCG likely reduces oocyte quality by causing early luteinization. Conversely, other studies have proposed that the presence of low-level HCG during the ovulation stimulation cycle enhances granulosa cell sensitivity to gonadotropins, ultimately increasing mature dominant oocytes and quality embryos. A possible explanation for these divergent findings could be attributed to different HCG levels in these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">In our patient, the &#x003b2;HCG level was reported to be as high as 372 on the trigger day and 987 mIU/ml on the puncture day. It appears that due to the low level of &#x003b2;HCG, it did not negatively impact oocyte quality. On the other hand, the increase in HCG level from 372 to 987 mIU/ml on the puncture day may have acted as a trigger. Along with GnRH agonist administration, this could have had dual trigger effects on oocyte maturation and aided in better maturation of oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Unlike previous studies, which typically initiated fertility preservation after pregnancy termination or delivery, this case proceeded with ovarian stimulation concurrently with pregnancy. A 2021 case report described ovarian tissue cryopreservation in a pregnant breast cancer patient, but tissue collection occurred after cesarean section at 32 weeks, necessitating pregnancy termination before ovarian tissue cryopreservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Despite the formation of eight embryos of acceptable quality, due to the incomplete treatment cycle of the patient and inability to transfer embryos, her pregnancy outcome remains unknown. Further research and reports in this area would be beneficial for better selection of ovulation stimulation cycle type in similar patients.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p id="Par21">Small Sample Size: As a single-case report, broader validation is needed by further studies.</p><p id="Par22">Long-Term Outcomes: The patient&#x02019;s future pregnancy potential using cryopreserved embryos remains unknown.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par23">This case demonstrates the technical feasibility of ovarian stimulation during pregnancy for oocyte retrieval, though efficacy and safety require validation in larger cohorts. This approach may be particularly advantageous for cancer patients who are unable to delay fertility treatments due to their condition and are candidates for gonadotoxic treatment, where the opportunity for preserving fertility does not exist. It suggests that ovarian stimulation can be integrated into urgent cancer care timelines, even with concurrent gestation. While the successful retrieval of oocytes during pregnancy in this instance is noteworthy, it does not constitute an endorsement of this approach as a conventional protocol for pregnant individuals. Prior to any global recommendation, extensive research and a thorough examination of ethical standards are imperative.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
