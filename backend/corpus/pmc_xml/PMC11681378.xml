Some studies<sup><xref rid="zoi241469r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241469r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> have shown that women diagnosed with breast cancer on biennial, as opposed to annual, mammographic screening have more poor prognostic factors, later-stage cancers, larger tumor sizes, and more interval cancers. However, few studies to date have reported changes in stage distribution or the incidence of regional or advanced cancers after the 2009 screening guidelines.

The SEER 22 and SEER 17 registries used in this study include cancer data from 22 and 17 regional US cancer registries, respectively.

No other exclusion criteria were applied. We did not collect race or ethnicity information for this study because we were not aiming to analyze the results according to race or ethnicity. Our analysis was determined to be exempt from review by the University of Vermont Institutional Review Board because the data are publicly available.

For analyses of surgical treatments, we obtained counts of cases treated with partial mastectomy, total mastectomy, and total mastectomy with reconstruction for in situ, localized, and regional diagnoses from the SEER 17 registries because they were unavailable for all study years in the SEER 22 registries. Partial mastectomies (also known as lumpectomy or breast-conserving surgery) included partial mastectomies with or without nipple resection and reexcision for gross or microscopic residual disease. Total mastectomies included those with or without removal of an uninvolved contralateral breast. Total mastectomy with reconstruction included those performed unilaterally or bilaterally with an uninvolved contralateral breast, a nipple-sparing mastectomy, and reconstruction using tissue, implant, or a combination.</p><p>Patients who did not undergo surgery or underwent an unknown type of surgery were excluded from the analyses of surgical trends. Patients aged 75 years or older who underwent total mastectomy with reconstruction were also excluded because there were few in this age group who underwent reconstruction.

Our results provide evidence of a decrease in in situ breast cancer incidence across all age groups since 2009, consistent with previously reported decreases in the use of breast cancer screening. Patterns in the rates of localized, regional, and distant breast cancer did not change markedly in relation to the timing of the guideline changes. Patterns in the rate of partial vs total mastectomies did not correlate temporally to the timing of the guideline change, and the patterns in surgical treatments after 2012 suggest a trend toward less invasive surgical procedures.</p><p>In situ breast cancer is predominantly detected on mammography screening.<sup><xref rid="zoi241469r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The decreases we observed in in situ breast cancer incidence are consistent with the decreases in screening use observed after the 2009 USPSTF screening guideline changes.<sup><xref rid="zoi241469r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241469r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241469r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241469r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> With this decrease in in situ breast cancer diagnoses since 2009, we anticipated that a proportion of undetected in situ breast cancer would progress, potentially contributing to an increasing incidence of localized breast cancers starting after 2009. However, we observed no discrete shifts in localized cancer incidence trends after 2009; rather, there was a steady continued increase in localized breast cancer consistent with the pattern observed before 2009. A possible exception was observed in women aged 75 years or older, among whom localized invasive cancer incidence increased beginning in 2017 after a period of decreasing in situ breast cancer incidence and stable localized invasive cancer incidence. However, this would require a long sojourn time (&#x02265;9 years) to progression to be attributed to the decrease in in situ breast cancer incidence that began in 2008.</p><p>With the substantial decreases in screening in women aged 40 to 49 years,<sup><xref rid="zoi241469r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241469r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241469r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> we would also anticipate increases in regional and distant cancers in that age group after 2009, which were not seen. There was no evidence for an increase in regional cancers across any age group. Women aged 75 years or older<sup><xref rid="zoi241469r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> experienced an increasing incidence of distant stage cancers during the study period, but the trend began in 2004, well before the 2009 guideline changes. Overall, there was no clear evidence that reductions in screening and in situ breast cancer diagnoses translated to an increasing incidence of more advanced-stage disease during the study period.</p><p>Regarding surgical treatment, there did not appear to be strong evidence that the 2009 screening guideline changes contributed to more aggressive surgical management for in situ, localized invasive, or regional breast cancer. With less screening, we anticipated larger in situ tumor sizes, leading to more total mastectomies, because larger tumors may render some patients ineligible for breast-conserving therapy. There was a trend toward increased total mastectomy and reconstruction rates in women aged 40 to 74 years, but the temporality does not fit our predictions because this trend began before 2009 and leveled off by 2013. After 2012, rates of total mastectomy mostly decreased, whereas rates of partial mastectomy increased or remained the same across all age groups and stages. This finding suggests that lower rates of screening may not have led to increasing incidence of larger cancers that necessitated total mastectomy. Alternatively, this finding could be explained by other factors influencing surgical management of breast cancer, including the increased use of oncoplastic reductions,<sup><xref rid="zoi241469r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241469r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> which allow for good cosmetic outcomes with larger amounts of breast tissue removed. In addition, the shift toward partial mastectomies is consistent with the more recent deescalation of surgical treatment for older patients because some studies<sup><xref rid="zoi241469r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241469r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241469r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> found no survival benefit of more intensive treatments as opposed to less invasive options.</p><p>We observed a consistent upward trend in total mastectomies with reconstruction vs total mastectomies alone during 2004 to 2013. The cause of this shift toward reconstruction is unclear but could be related to increased awareness or availability of reconstructive options, avoidance of radiation, or the desire to avoid future routine screening mammography. In this study, we were unable to determine the motive for reconstruction&#x02014;whether patients chose reconstruction for cosmesis despite being eligible for breast-conserving therapy, for desired cancer risk reduction in the contralateral breast because they wanted to avoid radiation therapy, or because their tumor size necessitated a total mastectomy. The literature surrounding the 2004 to 2013 time frame suggests that women undergo total mastectomies because they desire the reconstructive options, even if they are eligible for breast-conserving therapy.<sup><xref rid="zoi241469r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241469r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>We did not evaluate the frequency of axillary surgery because any observed trends would have been heavily influenced by the Z11 trial, which caused a shift away from axillary surgery for women diagnosed with T1 to T2 cancers with 1 to 2 positive sentinel nodes.<sup><xref rid="zoi241469r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241469r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, these patients would still undergo a partial vs a total mastectomy independent of axillary nodal status based on tumor characteristics, including size. Thus, the partial mastectomy group included those with and without axillary dissection, the total mastectomy alone group included those who underwent a modified radical mastectomy without reconstruction, and the total mastectomy with reconstruction group included those who underwent a modified radical mastectomy with reconstruction.</p><sec id="H2-6-ZOI241469"><title>Limitations</title><p>Several limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our results. First, the SEER registries provide a large, diverse sample population that broadly represents the country, but they do not capture the entire US population. Second, as an observational, retrospective study, this study could not directly assess the effect of screening use on disease stage at diagnosis or surgical treatment patterns. Other temporal patterns could contribute to the observed patterns and obscure the impact of screening changes. For example, decreases in cancer detection via reduced screening mammography use may have been offset by enhanced cancer detection using digital breast tomosynthesis technology in mammography examinations. Digital breast tomosynthesis has disseminated widely since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2011<sup><xref rid="zoi241469r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and has elevated cancer detection compared with conventional digital mammography.<sup><xref rid="zoi241469r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In addition, increased uptake of supplemental screening modalities (eg, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging) in response to mandated dense breast disclosures<sup><xref rid="zoi241469r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241469r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> may have also ameliorated the impact of reduced screening mammography use. Similarly, improvements in available surgical treatments (eg, cosmesis after oncoplastic reductions for large amounts of breast tissue removed<sup><xref rid="zoi241469r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>), increasing use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and other factors have likely influenced trends in surgical management. Third, we evaluated patterns in stage at diagnosis as characterized by SEER Summary Stage but did not investigate American Joint Committee on Cancer stage at diagnosis or tumor size and nodal status subcomponents of staging criteria. Fourth, mode of detection is unavailable in this dataset, so we were unable to evaluate screen-detected vs symptom-detected cases. Fifth, our analysis covers a 10-year follow-up period from the 2009 USPSTF guidelines; given the slow progression of some in situ disease, it is possible that increases in invasive breast cancer incidence may occur after 10 years of follow-up.</p><p>In April 2024, the USPSTF released updated breast cancer screening guidelines that expanded routine biennial screening to include women aged 40 to 49 years rather than starting at 50 years of age in response to the increase in invasive breast cancer incidence in this age group.<sup><xref rid="zoi241469r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Future studies will be required to evaluate the effect of these new recommendations on breast cancer screening use and incidence patterns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI241469"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this cohort study, the incidence of in situ breast cancer decreased with the decrease in use of screening mammography dating back to the 2009 USPSTF guideline change. However, to date, there does not appear to be evidence that reductions in screening and in situ breast cancer diagnoses have translated to increases in the incidence of more advanced-stage breast cancer. Since 2012, there has been a shift away from total mastectomies to partial mastectomies, likely reflecting surgical de-escalation literature and the increase in oncoplastic reconstruction options. Although the 2009 guideline changes did not appear to cause an inflection in the incidence of localized, regional, or distant breast cancer, further research is needed to understand the long-standing increase in localized invasive breast cancers and the decrease in regional invasive breast cancers observed during the past 20 years in the context of decreased breast cancer screenings.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI241469"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi241469r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><collab>US Preventive Services Task Force</collab></person-group>. <article-title>Screening for breast cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement</article-title>. <source>Ann Intern Med</source>. <year>2009</year>;<volume>151</volume>(<issue>10</issue>):<fpage>716</fpage>-<lpage>726, W-236</lpage>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7326/0003-4819-151-10-200911170-00008</pub-id>
