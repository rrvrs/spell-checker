The availability of quality medical abortion medicines is an essential component in the provision of quality abortion care. Understanding the factors that influence the availability of medical abortion medicines is important to help in-country policymakers, program planners, and providers improve availability and use of medical abortion.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Using a national assessment protocol and an availability framework, we assessed the availability of medical abortion medicines across five elements (Registration &#x00026; Quality Assurance, Policy &#x00026; Financing, Procurement &#x00026; Distribution, Provider Knowledge, and End-user Knowledge) in eight countries: Botswana, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Uganda between November 2020 and November 2021. The assessment included an online desk review and virtual or telephone-based key informant interviews.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Registration of medical abortion medicines&#x02014;misoprostol or co-packaged mifepristone and misoprostol products (combi-pack)&#x02014;was established in all countries, except the Central African Republic. In Lesotho and Eswatini, the national regulatory agency is still in development and importation of Cytotec&#x02122; misoprostol is permitted for off-label use in obstetrics/gynecology. Misoprostol was included in all countries&#x02019; essential medicines lists, except Botswana. Burkina Faso and Democratic Republic of the Congo also include mifepristone on their essential medicines list and medical abortion regimens in national abortion care service and delivery guidelines. Additionally, guidelines clarified health worker roles in the provision of abortion care specific to the legal context of each country and permitted task-shifting of abortion service provision. Where guidelines did not exist, medical abortion medicines and their use were not well integrated into the public health care system. Community awareness activities on abortion rights and services have been limited in scope across the countries assessed, however, end-users' awareness of misoprostol as a medical abortion medicine was reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">The national landscape assessments identified several cross-cutting opportunities to improve availability of medical abortion medicines, including importing quality-assured medical abortion medicines; developing nationally approved abortion service and delivery guidelines that optimize healthcare worker roles; and expanding communication strategies to reach end-users and pharmacists.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Medical abortion</kwd><kwd>Mifepristone</kwd><kwd>Misoprostol</kwd><kwd>Combi-pack</kwd><kwd>Abortion</kwd><kwd>Botswana</kwd><kwd>Burkina Faso</kwd><kwd>Central African Republic</kwd><kwd>Democratic Republic of the Congo</kwd><kwd>Eswatini</kwd><kwd>Lesotho</kwd><kwd>Namibia</kwd><kwd>Uganda</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>UNDP&#x02013;UNFPA&#x02013;UNICEF&#x02013;WHO&#x02013;World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2023</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par13">Recent estimates suggest that while the overall rate of unintended pregnancies has fallen, the proportion that ends in abortion has risen, largely driven by improved access to sexual and reproductive healthcare in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The combination of mifepristone followed by misoprostol, or misoprostol alone, are World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended methods for medical abortion (MA) that offer an alternative to surgical abortion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Medical abortion has been shown to enhance autonomy, choice, and safety in abortion care. Medical abortion allows women greater control over the timing and setting of the procedure, leading to increased satisfaction and empowerment. The safety profile of medical abortion is also well-established, with low complication rates, making it a viable option for many women seeking abortion care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, unsafe abortion&#x02014;an abortion carried out by a person lacking necessary skills or in an environment that lacks minimal medical standards, or both&#x02014;remains a public health challenge, particularly in low-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Of the 55.7 million abortions that occurred globally each year between 2010 and 2014, about 45 percent were unsafe and nearly all took place in a developing country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">In recent years, the number of misoprostol-alone and co-packaged mifepristone and misoprostol (combi-pack) products that have been used for abortion has grown globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Since 2014, five misoprostol and three mifepristone products and a combi-pack have been WHO prequalification (PQ)-listed, a global standard for quality assurance for pharmaceutical products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The availability of quality-assured MA medicines (WHO PQ-listed products or those approved by a Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]) is an essential component in the provision of quality abortion care. Understanding the factors that influence the availability of MA medicines is important to help policymakers, program planners, and providers in countries improve availability and use of quality medicines.</p><p id="Par15">This paper builds upon the WHO&#x02019;s landscape assessments on the availability of MA medicines, wherein &#x0201c;availability&#x0201d; means that a woman can request and receive a-quality-assured and affordable MA product or service when and where she needs it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This paper describes results from eight country assessments in Botswana, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, and Uganda. The purpose of the landscape assessments was to generate evidence to support policy dialogue and policymaking that is specific to the needs of a given country, in order to improve the availability of MA medicines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par16">Country selection criteria were based on discussions with WHO Regional Office for Africa and the UNDP-UNFPA-UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP). Factors such as the burden of unsafe abortion and public health need, opportunities to increase access to MA medicines, and country requests were considered during the selection process. Botswana, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, and Uganda were selected for the second round of national assessments. After a reading of each country&#x02019;s abortion law, seven of eight countries were categorized as medium restriction countries; wherein abortion is permitted in cases of rape, incest, fetal impairment, and to preserve the general, physical, and/or mental health of the pregnant woman (Botswana, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia), in addition to economic or social reasons (Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of the Congo). Uganda permits abortion only in cases to save the woman&#x02019;s life and as such, is characterized as highly restrictive.</p><p id="Par17">We developed a country assessment protocol to guide the methodology of the national landscape assessments in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The assessment protocol included the adaptation of an availability framework to MA medicines and abortion, a desk review, key informant interviews, and an analysis of the data to identify barriers and opportunities to improve MA availability. In the case of Lesotho and Namibia, approval or a waiver from an ethics committee was obtained. In the remaining countries the assessments were deemed not to constitute humans&#x02019; subjects research and ethical approval was not necessary. In all interviews, verbal informed consent to participate in assessment activities was obtained from all participants.</p><p id="Par18">We organized the assessments and their findings around an availability framework, including Registration &#x00026; Quality Assurance, Policy &#x00026; Financing, Procurement &#x00026; Distribution, Provider Knowledge, and End-user Knowledge, as described in detail previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Country assessments were conducted between November 2020 and November 2021. Data collection typically took between 12 and 14&#x000a0;weeks per country. Key informant interviews were held largely virtually or by telephone due to COVID-19 restrictions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Registration &#x00026; quality assurance</title><p id="Par19">The national regulatory authority (NRA) in each of the eight countries approved the MA products shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> While NRAs have their own quality standards, for the purpose of the assessments, a product with quality assurance is defined as one that is either WHO PQ-listed or approved by a SRA. Central African Republic had no MA medicines registered, whereas Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda had the greatest number of registered MA medicines with and without quality assurance, at 14 and 11 products, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Only one country, Burkina Faso, had a combi-pack (Medabon&#x000ae;, Sun Pharmaceuticals) that met the quality assurance criteria of the assessment. In Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, the combi-packs that are currently registered are not WHO PQ-listed or SRA-approved but are approved for medical termination of pregnancy up to 63&#x000a0;days or amenorrhea; they are made by the Indian manufacturers, Naari, Synochem, and Acme Formulations. Democratic Republic of the Congo is the only country to have a registered mifepristone product (Prevent&#x02122; 10&#x000a0;mg and 50&#x000a0;mg/Synochem) in our sample, which is neither SRA-approved nor WHO PQ-listed, nor is it the correct dose used for MA.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Number of registered MA medicines with and without quality assurance by country. <bold>*</bold>Health products are imported, not formally registered given the NRA is not fully operational</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12978_2024_1898_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par20">We found that the use of WHO&#x02019;s Collaborative Registration Procedure (CRP), which can enable accelerated regulatory approval in countries, was only used for MA medicines in Namibia. In Namibia, both misoprostol products, Celprotec&#x02122; and Avertiso&#x02122; (Acme Formulations), followed the WHO CRP pathway, and regulatory approval was granted within 90&#x000a0;days. In Lesotho and Eswatini the NRAs are not fully operational and the governments rely upon importation mechanisms of health products, not formal product registrations. Current importation requirements specify WHO PQ or SRA status of medicines, which will also be required for registration of new products when their NRAs are established. In both countries, Cytotec&#x02122; (Pfizer Pharmaceuticals) is imported, which is the originator misoprostol product and is not SRA-approved for MA, only the treatment of gastric ulcers. In Lesotho, a consignment of Cytomis&#x02122; misoprostol (Incepta Pharmaceuticals) was recently imported when the government could not secure Cytotec&#x02122; owing to global COVID-19 supply chain issues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Policy &#x00026; financing</title><p id="Par21">Standard treatment guidelines (STG) indicate rational and judicious use of medicines for specific health indications and national essential medicines lists (NEML) prioritize medicines to be procured for the public healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. National abortion care guidelines define who, when, where, and how abortion services are delivered in the country, and may be separate policy documents or included in STGs. The inclusion of the combination regimen in NEML, STGs, and abortion care guidelines varied across the countries assessed (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Mifepristone and misoprostol regimen for induced abortion is included on the NEML and abortion care service and delivery guidelines for Burkina Faso (2020) and Democratic Republic of the Congo (2020). Misoprostol regimens for prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage and postabortion care (PAC) management are listed in the NEML and STG for Eswatini (2012), Lesotho (2017), and Namibia (2021), as well as the NEML of Uganda (2016). Botswana excludes misoprostol and mifepristone on its NEML; however, a Ministry-approved guideline and trainers&#x02019; manual on PAC (2013) includes the combination and misoprostol-alone regimens for induced abortion. In Uganda, national guidelines for abortion care and service delivery are outdated, and revised guidelines have been stayed by the Ministry of Health since 2015, owing to disagreements on the content and a need to consult further with stakeholders, including religious leaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Inclusion of MA medicines or protocols for their use in national policy documents</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Country</th><th align="left">MA medicines on NEML (Year)</th><th align="left">Type of guideline that specifies MA protocols</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Botswana</td><td align="left">None (2012)</td><td align="left">Comprehensive PAC Guideline &#x00026; Trainer&#x02019;s Manual, 2013</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Burkina Faso</td><td align="left">Mifepristone &#x00026; Misoprostol (2020)</td><td align="left">Reproductive Health Protocols, 2018</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Central African Republic</td><td align="left">Misoprostol (2017)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="left">None</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Democratic Republic of the Congo</td><td align="left">Mifepristone &#x00026; Misoprostol (2020)</td><td align="left">Standards and Guidelines for Comprehensive Female-Centered Abortion Care, 2020</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Eswatini</td><td align="left">Misoprostol (2012)<sup>b</sup></td><td align="left">None<sup>c</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Lesotho</td><td align="left">Misoprostol (2017)</td><td align="left">None</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Namibia</td><td align="left">Misoprostol (2021)</td><td align="left">None</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Uganda</td><td align="left">Misoprostol (2016)</td><td align="left">National Policy Guidelines &#x00026; Service Standards for Sexual &#x00026; Reproductive Health &#x00026; Rights, 2nd Ed, 2012</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>In Central African Republic misoprostol is listed for gastric ulcers only, whereas misoprostol is included for postpartum hemorrhage and PAC on all other NEML when listed</p><p><sup>b</sup>At the time of the assessment, the Ministry of Health was revising the STG/EML.

Our assessment reinforced findings from previous country assessments that showed the registration of combi-pack for MA is possible irrespective of the legal framework for abortion in restrictive countries in Africa and Latin America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Uganda, a country with a highly restrictive abortion law, had the second highest number of registered MA medicines, including five combi-packs and six misoprostol products. The role of civil society organizations in accelerating the introduction and roll-out of misoprostol for postpartum hemorrhage in Uganda has been documented elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and lends credence to the role of market shaping efforts even in highly restrictive contexts to register multiple MA medicines, including the combi-pack for abortion. An argument can be made that MA products should be widely available irrespective of legal frameworks. Good quality MA products can contribute to making abortion safer.</p><p id="Par46">In our assessments, where SMOs are present, there is a combi-pack registered. Whereas misoprostol is imported by commercial wholesale distributors in the absence of an SMO presence in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, and Namibia. However, misoprostol is not well integrated into the healthcare system, and distribution is limited to tertiary facilities in these countries and a limited number of pharmacies. Moreover, Cytotec&#x02122;, the innovator misoprostol product approved for gastric ulcers only, was the dominant product imported. Off-label use of Cytotec&#x02122; is common in obstetrics and gynecology, but &#x0201c;off-label&#x0201d; means product inserts do not include dosage and administrative route information for unapproved clinical indications such as treatment of incomplete abortion and miscarriage, postpartum hemorrhage management and for induced abortion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Providers must rely on clinical training, STGs, or national abortion care guidelines for treatment protocols using such medicines, which were mixed across countries.</p><p id="Par47">The assessment identified the opportunity to support in-country registration of additional mifepristone and misoprostol products that are approved by an SRA or are WHO PQ-listed, using the Collaborative Registration Procedure or other regional regulatory reliance mechanisms to increase the availability of quality-assured products.

The Collaborative Registration Procedure agreement has only been signed by a few national regulatory agencies in our sample. It is envisioned that with greater participation in CRP, duplicative regulatory processes can be eliminated and registrations of quality-assured products can be accelerated. WHO is providing support and training to regulators to streamline the process.</p><p id="Par48">We found that where national abortion care guidelines were approved by the Ministry, mid-level providers at lower levels of the healthcare system were trained to provide abortion services, as in Burkina Faso and Democratic Republic of the Congo. In Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, and Namibia, use of misoprostol for PAC is restricted to doctors, despite global guidance for optimizing health worker roles to improve access to life-saving emergency obstetric care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These countries&#x02014;Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, and Namibia&#x02014;lacked national comprehensive abortion care guidelines.

Importantly, we assessed both the commodity supply-side components with provider and end-user knowledge, including a limited number of pharmacy visits. While pharmacy visits were mostly in the capital cities and not representative, they did bolster key informants&#x02019; perspectives that there is awareness of misoprostol in the urban centers. Future assessments would be bolstered by secret shopper visits or formal inventory assessments at a representative sample of urban, peri-urban, and rural retail outlets and public sector pharmacies. We limited our inquiry to those products formally registered by the NRA of each country. Assessing the availability of unregistered products, pricing, and prescription-status was outside the scope of the assessments but is documented elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The national landscape assessments present some additional limitations. The COVID-19 pandemic required governments to apply measures such as lockdowns and travel restrictions, this allowed for only a limited number of face-to-face interviews and most interviews took place virtually. Key informants were not always willing and/or available to discuss what they deemed a sensitive topic like MA, especially by email survey or phone. We acknowledge potential participation bias in those willing to speak on the topic, however we sought to mitigate this by seeking Ministry-approval and support. End-user knowledge was assessed by proxies relying on the available published literature and key informant interviews, instead of formal knowledge, attitudes and practices surveys, which were outside of the scope of the assessments. The assessments revealed a paucity of data on country-level abortion statistics and abortion-seekers knowledge and practices in each country. This information gap is cited elsewhere and an area in need of inquiry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We recognize that end-user knowledge relies upon other important potential barriers such as knowledge of where to access services and medicines, transportation, distance to and cost of services and medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Despite some limitations, several cross-cutting opportunities that are impacting the availability and use of MA in each country context were identified. These included the approval and import of quality-assured MA medicines, including combi-pack; the development and dissemination of nationally-approved comprehensive abortion care service and delivery guidelines that operationalize the abortion law and optimize healthcare worker roles, including mid-level providers; and recognizing the role of self-managed abortion by expanding information and communication models that reach women and providers alike, including pharmacists who are often first-line points of contact for abortion-seekers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par52">The availability of quality-assured medicines is an essential component of abortion care.

The national landscape assessments can serve as a resource for countries to develop actionable strategies to ensure the availability of medical abortion medicines, including importing quality-assured medical abortion medicines; developing nationally approved abortion service and delivery guidelines that optimize healthcare worker roles; and expanding communication strategies to reach end-users and pharmacists with accurate information on the laws governing abortion, access to care, and products and their use.</p><sec id="FPar5"><title>About this supplement</title><p id="Par53">This article has been published as part of Reproductive Health Volume 20 Supplement 1, 2023: Availability of quality-assured medical abortion medicines.
