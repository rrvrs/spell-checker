The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) has proposed different stages of sarcopenia, probable sarcopenia, defined as low muscle strength, and confirmed sarcopenia defined as low muscle strength and muscle mass. In addition, sarcopenia can be classified as severe if walking speed is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The main reasons for developing sarcopenia are age-related lifestyle factors such as decreased levels of physical activity and poor nutrition, various diseases, chronic inflammation and hormonal changes, all of which accelerate muscle loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The global prevalence of sarcopenia in adults over 60 years varies from 10 to 27% depending on the sarcopenia classification used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and the prevalence of sarcopenia is predicted to increase as the population ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Sarcopenia is associated with a variety of adverse outcomes, including falls, hospitalisation, all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and increased healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In terms of treatment and recovery in different patient groups, sarcopenia is associated with longer hospital stays, severe complications, postoperative infections and higher mortality compared to those without sarcopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Sarcopenia is an important health issue and therefore acceptable and safe prevention and treatment strategies for sarcopenia are needed, with a focus on older people.</p><p id="Par9">To counteract and manage sarcopenia, resistance training has been shown to be most effective in increasing muscle strength and functional capacity and maintaining muscle mass in older adults with sarcopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, higher levels of physical activity, and in particularly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, have been shown to be inversely associated with sarcopenia in both cross-sectional and longitudinal settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, interventions that include both resistance training and physical activities according to the physical activity recommendations could be effective in the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia.</p><p id="Par10">In addition to physical training, cognitive training has been proposed as a possible intervention to improve physical function and walking in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As successful mobility in every day environment requires different cognitive processes, such as executive functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], it may be hypothesized that cognitive training with focus on executive functioning effects on physical functions as well. In addition, due to overlapping neural networks and brain areas that are associated with both executive functions and dual-task walking speed may provide a mechanism by which cognitive training can improve physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a recent meta-analysis, cognitive training in addition to physical training had a small effect on overall physical function, but no effects on physical sub-domains, such as strength or walking speed in older adults with mild or no cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies exploring the effects of combination of physical and cognitive training on sarcopenia, and in our study, we included a cognitive component as an experimental approach to treating sarcopenia.</p><p id="Par11">Those with relatively lower strength or muscle mass levels may have greater absolute adaptations to resistance training in strength and muscle mass, when compared to those with greater strength levels at the baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, due to aging and age-related inflammation and physical inactivity, the anabolic resistance to resistance training and, for example, ingested protein may have increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesize that older adults with sarcopenia have greater improvements in strength and muscle mass, whereas those with severe sarcopenia may have reduced strength and mass adaptations when comparing to those without sarcopenia.</p><p id="Par12">Therefore, this study investigated whether the effects of 12-month physical training including the components of American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) 2007 physical activity guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and additional cognitive training on muscle strength on muscle mass and habitual walking speed differed between sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia groups in older adults who did not meet physical activity guidelines prior to the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par13">This study is a subgroup analysis of the single-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled Promoting Safe Walking among Older Adults (The PASSWORD) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The PASSWORD -study was conducted at the University of Jyv&#x000e4;skyl&#x000e4;, Finland. The primary objective of the PASSWORD- study was to investigate the effects of 12-month physical and cognitive training (PTCT) on maximal walking speed and executive functions compared to physical training (PT) alone among community-dwelling older adults who did not meet physical activity recommendations.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par14">An initial random sample of 3862 people living in Central Finland region was drawn from Finland&#x02019;s Population Information System administered by the Population Register Center and a total of 314 older adults (60% women), mean age 74.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.8 years, were recruited for the study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either PT or PTCT group after the baseline assessment. Physical training for both groups included supervised resistance (including balance) and supervised walking (including balance) training sessions once a week, home exercises with a resistance band 2&#x02013;3 times per week, and advice to do at least 150&#x000a0;min of moderate physical activity per week in bouts of at least 10&#x000a0;min according to the ACSM physical activity guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Supervised resistance training sessions included both hypertrophy and power training and it was organized in a senior gym equipped with machines utilizing air pressure technology and Smart Card/Smart Touch Software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hur.fi/en">http://hur.fi/en</ext-link>). Resistance of hypertrophy and power training increased progressively up to 70&#x02013;80% and 60% of 1 repetition maximum, respectively. Walking sessions were organized on a 400-meter outdoor circular track and, in winter, on a 200-meter indoor oval track.</p><p id="Par17">Computer-based cognitive training in the PTCT group targeted executive functions, more specifically set-shifting, inhibition, and working memory updating. In-house developed computer program (<italic>i</italic>PASS) was used, and participants were advised to do cognitive training 3&#x02013;4 times a week. One training session lasted for 15&#x02013;25&#x000a0;min, depending on individual&#x02019;s skills and performance.</p><p id="Par18">Training adherence was tracked separately for each exercise modality using training logs and diaries. Adherence to the supervised strength and walking training sessions was calculated as the percentage of planned sessions attended by participants.

Maximal isometric grip and knee extension strength were measured from the side of the dominant hand using a dynamometer chair (Metitur, Palokka, Finland). In both strength measurements, after 2&#x02013;3 practice trials, participants were encouraged to squeeze the handle or extend the knee as forcefully as possible. In both measurements best performance from three to five maximal attempts was taken as the result. The appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI, kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was calculated by dividing appendicular skeletal muscle mass assessed with dual-x-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Lunar Prodigy, GE Healthcare, Madison, WI, USA) by the square of the body height. Photocells were used to measure the time to complete the 20&#x000a0;m walk at habitual speed and walking speed (m/s) was calculated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Sarcopenia</title><p id="Par20">Sarcopenia was assessed using the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People diagnostic criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

Sarcopenia was confirmed if the participant, in addition to low grip strength, also had a low ASMI (&#x0003c;&#x02009;5.5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> for women and &#x0003c;&#x02009;7.0&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> for men). Sarcopenia was considered severe if, in addition to low grip strength and low ASMI, the habitual walking speed was less than 0.8&#x000a0;m/s. Grip strength of one participant was missing and this case was left out from the further analysis. In this study none of the participants had severe sarcopenia.

Models were adjusted with age, sex, resistance training and walking training adherence. As there were no differences in the change in muscle strength, mass, or walking speed between PTCT and PT groups in either sarcopenia group (see supplementary file), PT and PTCT groups were pooled for further analysis.</p><p id="Par24">For the main analyses of the pooled data, linear GEE models adjusted for age, sex, and adherence to supervised resistance and walking training were used to explore study group, time, and time by study group interaction effects on the main outcomes.

Physical training increased knee extension strength and habitual walking speed similarly in participants with and without sarcopenia, while the increase in grip strength was greater in the sarcopenia group. No improvement or difference in ASMI changes was seen. This study provides evidence that multicomponent physical training according to physical activity guidelines can be as beneficial or even more beneficial for increasing strength in people with sarcopenia than in those without.</p><p id="Par33">Although a combination of physical and cognitive training may provide small additive benefits for physical function, which is a key determinant of severe sarcopenia, compared to physical training alone, it may not provide additive benefits for muscle strength or muscle mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This is supported by our findings that cognitive training in addition to physical training did not show greater improvements in any component of sarcopenia in older adults with or without sarcopenia. Of note, the discrepancy with the findings of Gavelin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] may be explained by the fact that the present study sample consisted of relatively well-functioning older adults and did not include individuals with severe sarcopenia.</p><p id="Par34">Although muscle mass did not increase in either study group, it was maintained over the 12-month period. Previous studies have shown that adults aged &#x0223c;75 years have an annual loss of muscle mass of 0.6 to 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Chen et al. found that only interventions with moderate-to-vigorous intensity resistance training (greater than 70% of 1 repetition maximum) had an effect on ASMI in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this study, the intensity of resistance training progressively increased above 70% of 1 repetition maximum, but the weekly frequency for gym-based resistance training was probably too low to increase muscle mass. To improve muscle mass in older adults, the frequency of weekly resistance training should be higher than in this study, about 2&#x02013;3 times a week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although the intervention included home exercises with a resistance band, this may not provide sufficient loading to gain muscle mass, but to maintain it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the future, more intensive resistance training interventions may be recommended to increase muscle mass in older adults with sarcopenia. In addition, nutritional interventions, such as protein supplementation, may be recommended alongside resistance training to have greater improvement in muscle mass in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">In our study grip strength, knee extension strength and walking speed increased after one year of multicomponent training. The effect size for improvements in knee extension strength was large in the sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia groups, whereas the effect sizes for grip strength and walking speed were from small to medium. As the intervention included more lower body exercise and walking, this explains why the intervention had a greater effect on lower limb muscle strength. In a recent meta-analysis exploring the effects of resistance training on muscle strength in the oldest adults (&#x0003e;&#x02009;80 years), the effects of resistance training were seen in knee extension strength, but training had no effect on grip strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Grgic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] further discussed that in some cases, grip strength testing may provide limited insight into the effectiveness of resistance training programme, as training is often more focused on the lower body. According to our hypothesis, those with lower baseline strength values had greater improvements in strength compared to those with higher baseline values. This was only shown for grip strength and not for knee extension strength. This may be explained by the fact that there was a larger difference in grip strength (14&#x000a0;kg) compared to knee extension strength (9&#x000a0;kg) between the non-sarcopenia and sarcopenia groups.</p><p id="Par36">The results of our study are consistent with a recent systematic review suggesting that combined resistance and aerobic training improves both muscle strength and physical performance in older adults with sarcopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our results are consistent as well with the recommendations for resistance training in the management and prevention of sarcopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, there is some debate about the frequency of the resistance training and whether once a week is sufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our study suggests that combined physical training including once a week instructed resistance training and home-based exercises is sufficient to increase muscle strength.</p><p id="Par37">It is important to emphasize that physical training according to physical activity guidelines is effective to increase muscle strength and walking speed in sarcopenia group as shown in the present study. This is noteworthy since physical activity guidelines are well promoted in general population and in different health care settings as well. Currently, the implementation of physical activity guidelines among older people is still low. In the most recent report among the Finnish population, about one third or less of adults aged 65 years and over, achieved the physical activity target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], while the proportion of people meeting the guidelines in the Europe is less than 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Therefore, we should focus on improving people&#x02019;s adherence to physical activity guidelines aiming to prevent and manage sarcopenia more effectively. We need multiple strategies to increase physical activity of older people, such as increasing social and environmental support, improving access to physical activity facilities, organising group exercise, and supporting health-care systems to implement exercise-based programmes in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], as well as promoting physical activity through applications of behaviour change theories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">As successful implementation of physical activity guidelines has positive effects on sarcopenia determinants, such as muscle strength and walking speed, it may also help to maintain the physical function in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Good physical function promotes functional independence and health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In addition, higher levels of muscle strength and good physical performance are important factors in preventing falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and decreasing healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. From a physiological point of view, maintaining muscle mass plays an important role in the prevention of age-related diseases, such as insulin resistance, chronic inflammation or cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">To our best knowledge, only a few studies have investigated the effects of long-term combined resistance, and aerobic training on sarcopenia. In the latest meta-analysis, which included a total of 48 trials that studied the effects of different training programs on sarcopenia, the average duration of the interventions was 17.4 weeks, and two trials lasted up to 48 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The results showed that resistance training was best for improving grip strength and muscle mass, while non-resistance training was best for increasing walking speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Recently conducted SPRINTT -study investigated whether 36-months of moderate-intensity PA training, including aerobic, strength, balance, and flexibility exercises, had an effect on grip strength and muscle mass in frail people compared with a group that received education about healthy ageing. In the SPRINTT -study grip strength and lean mass decreased during the 36-month period, but the decrease was less in the intervention group than in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">In this study adherence to the 12-month training was relatively high and the attrition rate was low, which was also seen in the SPRINTT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Important finding was that adherence to training was similar between the sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia groups. In this study, there were several factors that have previously been identified as playing a key role in helping people to adhere to training, including a multidisciplinary training programme and supervision in group-based sessions that provide social support, relatedness and feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In addition, the use of air-pressure machines equipped with the HUR SmartCard system that remembers the user&#x02019;s settings and resistance allowed for easy and enjoyable resistance training and monitoring, that could have an impact to adherence. In addition, the adherence to supervised training sessions was associated with the changes in muscle strength and walking speed. This highlights, that during interventions, maintaining weekly training routines are mandatory for optimal gains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par41">Physical training protocol was designed according to ACSM physical activity guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and was adapted from our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and the LIFE study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], including supervised group exercise sessions.

Because of the explorative nature of the study, there were no power calculations performed for the analysis, and no passive or usual care control group were involved. In addition, relatively healthy people participated to the present study and therefore the effectiveness of intervention could be greater when studying diagnosed sarcopenia individuals. Finally, the total number of participants in the sarcopenia group was relatively low compared to the without sarcopenia group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par43">A yearlong combined physical training including components from physical activity recommendations seem to be effective in increasing maximal grip, knee extension strength, and habitual walking speed in older adults with or without sarcopenia.

More intensive resistance training may be needed to increase muscle mass in older adults. Cognitive training in addition to physical training had no beneficial effects on strength, muscle mass or walking speed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
