In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), granular details about provider actions during resuscitation are largely unknown; therefore, identifying targets for improvement is difficult. The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) recognizes the importance of uniform reporting of clinical neonatal resuscitation studies and published a guideline recommending specific variables to include. We established an open cohort study for newborn resuscitation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as a platform for developing and evaluating novel strategies to improve newborn resuscitation. We included all in-born neonates at two health facilities in Kinshasa, DRC. We gathered data on all enrollees via delivery registry and medical record abstraction. Using the Liveborn Observation app, we directly observed care at birth for a convenience sample. We collected heart rate data when providers used NeoBeat, a battery-operated heart rate meter. From September 2022 to August 2023, we abstracted delivery registry and medical record data for 6,414 newborns and gathered observational data on the infant&#x02019;s breathing status and provider actions for 3,166 (49%). Our dataset includes 85% of ILCOR&#x02019;s recommended core variables applicable to this setting, and 50% of ILCOR&#x02019;s applicable supplemental variables. Our registry also contains variables beyond those recommended by ILCOR that are contextually important for evaluating resuscitation care in LMICs such as duration of suctioning, pauses in positive pressure ventilation and fresh stillbirth. Our experience establishing a resuscitation registry with novel tools in the DRC serves as a model for resuscitation research in low-resource settings. Our cohort study provides important insight to inform subsequent versions of ILCOR&#x02019;s guideline on uniform reporting of neonatal resuscitations studies globally.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Laerdal Foundation Program Award</institution>

Newborn resuscitation training reduces intrapartum-related deaths, but further reductions are limited by the necessary highly technical skills [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), we noted substantial gaps in care among providers trained in newborn resuscitation, including underuse, delays and interruptions in positive pressure ventilation (PPV) for newborns not breathing well by 60 seconds after birth [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Understanding what happens at the bedside during neonatal resuscitations is critical to improve resuscitation care. Currently, in low-resource settings, granular details about moment-to-moment provider actions during newborn resuscitation are rarely available. Furthermore, resuscitation studies in these settings often present baseline characteristics and neonatal outcomes (e.g., Apgars, neonatal mortality, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) without the details of process indicators (i.e., provider actions) that contributed to these outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Understanding the timing, duration, and order of resuscitation practices is necessary to identify quality gaps and develop strategies to improve care.</p><p>The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) Neonatal Life Support Task Force recently published guidelines for uniform reporting of neonatal resuscitation in clinical studies [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The recommendations include core and supplemental variables within seven relevant domains: setting, patient, antepartum, birth/pre-resuscitation, resuscitation, post-resuscitation, and outcomes. Of note, the working group members all practice in highly resourced settings; to ensure the guideline was globally applicable, the working group solicited feedback from providers and investigators in low-resource settings and revised the guideline accordingly before finalization. As these guidelines are implemented globally, more in-depth engagement with a broad group of stakeholders in low-resource settings is needed to increase applicability to those settings [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. ILCOR&#x02019;s recommendations are important for standardizing data elements globally to allow for better interpretation of individual studies and data synthesis across studies.</p><p>We established a resuscitation registry in health facilities in the DRC using novel tools, including a mobile health application for observational data collection of resuscitation events (the Liveborn Observation application [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) and a battery-operated heart rate meter (NeoBeat). This registry is a platform to support development and evaluation of novel strategies to improve resuscitation care in low-resource settings.

Of the 13 fresh stillborns, four received PPV.</p><p>By facility leadership report, we identified 5 (16%) of ILCOR core variables that did not apply to the facilities in our registry (namely, umbilical cord milking [not practiced], CPAP [not offered in the delivery room], respiratory interfaces [limited to facemask only], supplemental oxygen [not offered in the delivery room] and therapeutic hypothermia [therapy not available]). Of the 26 applicable ILCOR core variables, we collected 25% via medical record abstraction, 13% using the Liveborn Observation app, 29% using the delivery registry, and 3% using NeoBeat (<xref rid="pone.0324332.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). For ILCOR supplemental variables, we identified 10 (24%) that were not applicable (namely, umbilical cord pH [not offered], number of times umbilical cord milked and whether cord was intact [cord milking not practiced], time endotracheal tube placed [intubation not offered], PPV device [only bag and mask available], respiratory settings [only bag and mask available], FiO2 at completion of resuscitation [oxygen not offered in the delivery room], fluid boluses [not offered in the delivery room], other interventions [not offered in the delivery room], therapeutic hypothermia mode and control mode [therapy not available] and brain injury on neuroimaging [neuroimaging not offered]). Of the 32 applicable ILCOR supplemental variables, we collected 24% with the Liveborn Observation app, 3% with medical record abstraction, and 12% with the facility delivery registry (<xref rid="pone.0324332.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0324332.g003"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0324332.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Data sources for ILCOR-recommended variables in the registry.</title><p>After eliminating non-applicable variables per report by facility leadership, we extracted the remaining ILCOR variables using a combination of the facility delivery registry, the medical record, the Liveborn Observation app and NeoBeat (see <xref rid="pone.0324332.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

Unreliable documentation in the medical record was a barrier to recording meconium-stained fluid. Limited diagnostic tools were a barrier to collecting air leak syndrome (e.g., lack of xrays) and moderate to severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE; e.g., lack of training in neurological examination and no access to blood gas analysis). Self-prescribed medication usage was a barrier to accurately documenting antenatal steroids; while antenatal steroids are reliably recorded in the medical record when given at the facility, patients frequently obtain steroids independently in the community. We also noted an increased burden of time to conduct individual medical record abstraction compared to collecting data from the facility&#x02019;s delivery register. Training our large pool of observers to use the Liveborn Observation app was a barrier; as such, although the Liveborn Observation app facilitates documentation of the start time and duration of cardiac compressions, we chose not to include these variables in our registry due to the rarity of HBB-trained providers using this therapy. Several facilitators were key to implementation of our registry. Strong support from labor and delivery leadership facilitated partnerships with the primary providers who are midwives. Including resuscitation training and the provision of NeoBeat in the registry increased motivation for midwives to participate in data collection.</p><p><xref rid="pone.0324332.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> lists all variables in our registry with the source and completeness of the data. The vast majority of our variables not recommended by ILCOR are in the pre-resuscitation and resuscitation domains; we collected these variables using the Liveborn Observation app, including the timing, duration, and frequency of drying/stimulation, suctioning, and PPV. We also collected data on stillbirth, including type, using delivery registry abstraction.</p><p>Given our strategy of observing a convenience sample of births, approximately half of participants in the registry have data on resuscitation care. The cohort we observed with the Liveborn app was biased towards a less sick population with lower rates of Cesarean section (0.3% vs 2.2%), prematurity (12.5% vs 17.9% born at 28&#x02013;36 weeks gestation), low birth weight (9.3% vs 12.8% birth weight 1500-2499g), APGAR 1min&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;5 (4.7% vs 7.4%), and neonatal deaths before discharge (0.9% vs 2%) compared to those not observed [<xref rid="pone.0324332.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>].

Our dataset incorporates 85% of applicable ILCOR core variables. The registry includes additional variables beyond those recommended by ILCOR that allow for thorough identification of gaps in quality resuscitation pertinent to low-resource settings.</p><p>Our experience establishing a registry with novel tools provides a model for implementing ILCOR&#x02019;s guidelines for uniform reporting of clinical resuscitation studies in low-resource settings. We found that a combination of abstraction from facility records and direct observation was needed to obtain critical data relevant to neonatal resuscitation. The facility delivery registry endorsed by the DRC Ministry of Health for data collection in all birth facilities included 29% of ILCOR core variables and 12% of ILCOR supplemental variables. This suggests that collecting ILCOR-recommended variables in many low-resource settings will require abstraction from medical records which have varying standards for the amount and quality of data. Paper-recording keeping in LMICs adds to the burden of data collection for a registry; investment in a standardized electronic delivery register and/or medical record could improve completeness of the data and reduce the burden of data collection. While limited quality and content of medical record data may be common barriers to implementing ILCOR&#x02019;s guidelines in low-resource settings [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we found high rates of facility documentation in the medical record for several ILCOR core variables not initially in our registry. This made it feasible to expand the registry to include three additional core variables from the medical record (cardiac compressions, epinephrine, temperature at 1 hour) with feasibility to further expand by adding eight supplemental variables from the medical record. For supplemental ILCOR variables, the Liveborn Observation app was particularly key; of the 13 applicable supplemental variables in the birth/pre-resuscitation and resuscitation domains, we collected 10 (77%) using the app. While we did not collect data on chest compressions, these could be documented using additional features embedded in the Liveborn Observation app.</p><p>Based on common gaps in quality resuscitation care in low-resource settings, we identified key additional variables in the birth/pre-resuscitation and resuscitation domains beyond those recommended by ILCOR that are important indicators to collect [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In particular, delayed initiation of PPV and interruption of PPV are common in low-resource settings with significant impact on neonatal outcomes. For every 30-second delay in PPV, the risk of death or prolonged hospitalization increases 16% [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We observed that delayed PPV and pauses in PPV were accompanied by extended duration of stimulation and suctioning, supporting our previous observations in the DRC [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Similar observations have been reported in Tanzania [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These findings have implications for recommendations globally, calling for de-emphasis of suctioning and more emphasis on continued PPV. ILCOR&#x02019;s current recommendation of collecting simply whether or not stimulation and suctioning were performed does not permit the discovery of potential factors contributing to delayed and interrupted PPV in low-resource settings. Furthermore, although pauses in ventilation are common, ILCOR&#x02019;s recommended variables for PPV [time PPV started (min:sec) and the total duration of PPV (expressed in whole minutes)] do not adequately measure this gap. At a minimum, we recommend considering the addition of average duration of each PPV episode (in seconds) and average time between each PPV episode (in seconds) as supplemental variables (<xref rid="pone.0324332.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). To understand why ventilation is delayed or interrupted, we also recommend considering the following variables: total duration of stimulation prior to initiation of PPV, total duration of suctioning prior to initiation of PPV, total duration of stimulation between initiation and end of PPV, and total duration of suctioning between initiation and end of PPV (<xref rid="pone.0324332.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). To acquire this level of detail, data collection during direct observation would be necessary, and this type of data collection is burdensome. The impact of this practical constraint can be minimized by observing a subset of deliveries. Finally, the type of quality gaps common to a particular setting may be linked to the qualifications of the provider (e.g., skilled birth attendant, nurse, midwife, general practitioner, pediatrician, neonatologist); a facility-level variable capturing the type of provider responsible for resuscitating newborns could be considered as an addition to the ILCOR supplemental variables in the setting domain (<xref rid="pone.0324332.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0324332.t003"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0324332.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Considerations for use of ILCOR-recommended guidelines for uniform reporting of neonatal resuscitation in LMICs.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0324332.t003" id="pone.0324332.t003g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Neonatal Utstein Element</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Current ILCOR Guideline</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Additions to Consider for Research in LMICs</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Eligible resuscitation events</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Respiratory and cardiac failure leading to a clinical decision to provide PPV or chest compressions</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Newborns (liveborn or fresh stillborn) not crying by 30&#x02009;s after birth who do not receive PPV or chest compressions</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Setting</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">

Furthermore, we recognize evaluation of breathing status can be a complex and subjective skill, particularly when differentiating between adequate and inadequate breathing. An alternative, and more objective measure of breathing is crying. An observational study in Nepal showed that non-crying after birth had a 100% sensitivity for non-breathing, and that non-crying but breathing infants had almost 12-fold odds of pre-discharge mortality [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We suggest that the time to first cry may be a more objective variable for core measurements rather than respiratory effort at one minute (<xref rid="pone.0324332.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Newly-recommended quality process indicators for evaluation of newborn resuscitation in low-resource settings focus on crying rather than breathing due to the subjectivity and complexity of respiratory evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Within the outcomes domain, our registry includes two key variables not included in ILCOR&#x02019;s recommended variables: stillbirth (fresh versus macerated) and neonatal death in the first 24 hours. In low-resource settings, flaccid liveborn infants may be misclassified as stillborn [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Infrequent early and inaccurate heart rate detection after the birth of a non-breathing neonate may contribute to misclassification. Misclassification of a newborn as stillborn rather than liveborn may bias providers towards limited or no resuscitation. [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] To adequately evaluate resuscitation care of depressed, liveborn neonates who may be inaccurately classified as fresh stillborn in low-resource settings, we strongly recommend the addition of stillbirth, including type, to the outcome domain (<xref rid="pone.0324332.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Early perinatal mortality, defined as neonatal mortality in the first 24 hours after birth and fresh stillbirths, should be considered as an additional variable that averts the problem of misclassification of stillbirth (<xref rid="pone.0324332.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>ILCOR&#x02019;s reporting guideline focused on liveborn neonates who received resuscitation, defined as those with respiratory failure requiring PPV, bradycardia, and cardiac arrest. We strongly recommend expanding what is considered &#x02018;resuscitation,&#x02019; particularly in low-resource settings where PPV for non-breathing newborns at birth may be underutilized. In Nepal, a prospective observational study showed a significant increase in the initiation of PPV for non-crying infants following resuscitation quality improvement interventions (OR 1.22 [95% CI 1.04&#x02013;1.44]) [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the DRC, we found that ventilation was provided to only 20% of newborns who were not breathing well by 60 seconds after birth. (1) This suggests that we cannot assume that needing PPV is equivalent to receiving PPV in low-resource settings. Due to the concern for underuse of PPV in low-resource settings, we recommend considering expanding the target population to include all newborns not crying by 30 seconds after birth (<xref rid="pone.0324332.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Ministries of Health may similarly consider expanding the target population for evaluating quality resuscitation given underuse of PPV in low-resource settings.</p><p>Reducing morbidity and mortality from intrapartum-related events requires moving beyond a focus on postnatal resuscitation to include an understanding of fetal well-being. In reflecting on the ILCOR antepartum domain, we noted key details regarding fetal well-being and acute perinatal events are not included. While ILCOR recommends collecting data on maternal hemorrhage, other key events in the intrapartum period, such as cord prolapse, uterine rupture, obstructed labor, and severe fetal heart rate abnormalities, are not included. Such intrapartum events significantly increase the risk of respiratory depression and neonatal encephalopathy; for example, in Uganda, hemorrhage, cord prolapse, or uterine rupture significantly increased the risk of neonatal encephalopathy (adjusted OR 8.74 [95% CI 1.70&#x02013;45.02]) [<xref rid="pone.0324332.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While we aspire to add more granular data on the intrapartum period to our registry, we recognize the high burden of collecting this data in settings with limited diagnostic tools, including limited use of continuous fetal heart rate monitoring. Given current norms regarding intrapartum monitoring in low-resource settings, we do not recommend these variables for inclusion in ILCOR&#x02019;s core variables but suggest they could be considered as supplemental. Type of fetal heart rate monitoring (e.g., continuous or intermittent? electronic or fetoscope?) could be added to the ILCOR supplemental variables in the setting domain to clarify the level of intrapartum care provided (<xref rid="pone.0324332.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Intrapartum data is critical for identifying and evaluating strategies to prevent HIE; creative and low-cost strategies for gathering this data in low-resource settings are needed.</p><p>Our strategy for implementing a resuscitation registry in the DRC has several limitations. While direct observation was a key part of our strategy for data collection, it is burdensome and requires continual staff presence due to the unpredictability of when births will occur. We lowered the burden by observing only a convenience sample; however, drawing inferences from a convenience sample introduces the potential for selection bias. The convenience sample we observed was biased towards a less sick population, likely due to less availability for midwives to observe during more acute deliveries. The study design did not include comparative analysis, which limits our understanding of the effect of establishing the registry. The use of NeoBeat was low (only 3.6% of infants at one minute after birth had a measured heart rate), which makes inferences from heart rate data challenging in this cohort. Midwives building the habit of using NeoBeat has been challenging, and we are exploring midwives&#x02019; preferences of using it on every baby or only ill infants. The burden of cleaning and charging the device is also an important consideration. Given the very early time to first heart rate detected for the first quartile (median 35 seconds [Q1 5, Q3 68]) we suspect that some registrations with the Liveborn Observation app were initiated some seconds after birth. While the data collected with the Liveborn Observation app are likely more precise than recall, because observers may also have clinical responsibilities, competing tasks may influence the accuracy of the data. We did not perform quality checks or evaluate inter-rater reliability among observers. Since the initial year of this registry, we have restricted data collection with the Liveborn Observation app to study nurses only. Exclusive research staff for observations, however, significantly increases the resources involved. It is important to note that our experience implementing a resuscitation registry in the DRC may not be generalizable to all low-resource settings.</p><p>Since the fall of 2023, we have incorporated audio-video recording for resuscitations occurring at the warmer using a digital camera secured within a case to standardize the area of footage captured. The observer initiates audio-video recording via the Liveborn Observation app. We anticipate that audio-video recording will have several potential advantages. Future directions for the registry include validation of the accuracy of observational data compared to audio-video recording, and inclusion of audio-video recording data on corrective actions during PPV, competing tasks, and team communication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We established an open cohort study focused on newborn resuscitation in two delivery facilities in Kinshasa, DRC, using a combination of delivery registry, medical record abstraction, observation of deliveries, and heart rate monitoring.

Our experience establishing a resuscitation registry with novel tools in the DRC serves as a model for resuscitation research in low-resource settings and provides important insight to support subsequent versions of ILCOR&#x02019;s guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="sec011" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0324332.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Accessible Data</label><caption><title>LEARN Registry Manuscript Data for Sharing.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0324332.s001.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0324332.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Inclusivity in Global Research</label><caption><title>Inclusivity in Global Research.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0324332.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0324332.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Maternal and neonatal characteristics observed and not observed with the Liveborn Observation.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0324332.s003.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0324332.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2.

</p><p>October 28, 2024</p><p>Dr. Ribka Amsalu</p><p>Academic Editor</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr. Amsalu,</p><p>Thank you for your further consideration of our manuscript titled &#x0201c;Establishment of a neonatal resuscitation registry in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: An open cohort study&#x0201d; (PONE-D-24-30580). We thank you and the reviewer for the helpful comments, and respectfully submit the final revised manuscript. Below is a point-by-point response to the reviewer&#x02019;s comments.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Jackie K. Patterson, MD, MPH</p><p>Associate Professor of Pediatrics</p><p>Division of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine</p><p>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</p><p>Response to Reviewer</p><p>The current study is on a topic of relevance and general interest to the readers of the journal. I found the paper to be overall well-written and felt confident that the authors performed careful the preparation of the manuscript. However, I still have some comments and thoughts, I want to share with the authors to further improve their paper:</p><p>1) Following references are missing: First two sentences of the introduction</p><p>Response:</p><p>We added Oza et al. to the first sentence of the introduction, Bellad et al., Msemo et al., and Versantvoort et al. to the second sentence of the introduction.</p><p>2) Row 52: ... critical improving / to improve .. not to improving</p><p>Response:</p><p>We revised per your suggestion.</p><p>3) Fig. 2: Why didn't you include newborns not crying by 60 sec in the group of interest for ILCOR?</p><p>Response:</p><p>The ILCOR population of interest is focused on the provision of PPV and not on those with apnea or insufficient respirations who do not receive PPV. We recognize that Figure 2 may have been confusing as we displayed those not crying by 30 seconds and those not crying by 60 seconds which are not mutually exclusive groups. We have deleted the box referring to those not crying by 60 seconds for clarity. As resuscitation algorithms emphasize initiating ventilation by 60 seconds after birth, we recommended including all newborns not crying by 30 sec.</p><p>4) I would put all footnotes next to the variable name and not next to the number to get consistency</p><p>Response:</p><p>We revised the footnotes in Table 1 to be next to the variable for consistency.</p><p>5) Row 194: you are not able to infer from Fig 3b on the origin of data</p><p>Response:</p><p>We added a reference to Table 1 in the Figure 3 legend to add transparency about the data sources.</p><p>6) Table 2: For the variable "Heart Rate -&#x0003e; NeoBeat -&#x0003e; Heart rate at initiation of PPV" did you only use data from the NeoBeat device or also from the Liveborn Observation app?</p><p>Response:</p><p>For Table 2, all heart rate data obtained in this cohort comes from NeoBeat. We only collected heart rate data for cases where the Liveborn Observation app was used. NeoBeat connects via Bluetooth to the Liveborn Observation app and the data is then downloaded from the Liveborn Observation app.</p><p>7) Table 2: Is there a difference between the variables "PPV -&#x0003e; ILCOR Supplemental -&#x0003e; Total duration of all episodes [min]" and "PPV -&#x0003e; Liveborn Observation app -&#x0003e; Total duration of all episodes [s]" beside from the unit?</p><p>Response:</p><p>Yes, the difference between &#x0201c;Total duration of all episodes [min]&#x0201d; in ILCOR supplemental and &#x0201c;Total duration of all episodes [s]&#x0201d; is the unit. Recording duration in whole units of minutes does not give enough granular data to understand gaps in care related to interruptions in PPV. Additions in the text were made in lines 268-271 to help clarify this distinction for readers.</p><p>8) Table 3: are you suggesting the adaptations as additional variables or to adapt the current recommendations</p><p>Response:</p><p>In Table 3, we suggest additional variables to consider. Table 3 column header and first recommended addition were revised for clarity.</p><p>9) Please add the following points: limitations, knowledge gaps and next steps</p><p>Response:</p><p>We discuss the limitations of our study in the second to last paragraph of the discussion; we have clarified the content of this paragraph with a new topic sentence.

Significance and Novelty:</p><p>The paper presents a significant contribution to neonatal care research, particularly in low-resource settings like the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The establishment of a neonatal resuscitation registry using novel tools such as the Liveborn Observation application and NeoBeat is innovative and addresses a critical gap in understanding real-time resuscitation practices. The registry's alignment with the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) recommendations enhances its relevance and potential for global impact. The detailed account of the registry's development, including provider training and the adaptation of tools for the local context (e.g., sections 104-113), demonstrates a thoughtful approach to addressing the challenges of neonatal care in low-resource settings.</p><p>2. Strengths:</p><p>The methodology employed in this study, including the use of digital tools for direct observation and data collection, represents a robust approach to capturing detailed information on neonatal resuscitation practices. This methodological rigor is a key strength of the paper.</p><p>The relevance of this research to global health, especially in improving neonatal outcomes in low-resource settings, cannot be overstated. The paper's focus on a real-world application of ILCOR guidelines and the identification of gaps in current practices is particularly commendable (e.g., sections 77-78).</p><p>The comprehensive data collection spanning over a year and covering a significant number of newborns (6,414 newborns with observational data on 3,159) provides a solid foundation for the study's conclusions and recommendations (e.g., section 33-34).</p><p>3. Weaknesses:</p><p>The paper lacks a comparative analysis or control group, which may limit the ability to attribute observed outcomes directly to the interventions or registry implementation.</p><p>While the paper mentions the congruence of the registry with ILCOR variables, there is limited discussion on the implications of these findings for neonatal care practices or policy recommendations beyond the study context.</p><p>Some sections of the paper are heavily descriptive, particularly in the introduction and methodology sections, which might detract from the focus on the study's outcomes and implications.</p><p>The discussion on barriers and facilitators to resuscitation data collection is somewhat brief and lacks depth. Given the novel approach of this registry, a more detailed exploration of these aspects would be valuable for replication in other settings.</p><p>4. Suggestions for Improvement:</p><p>Introduce a comparative analysis where possible, or discuss the limitations of the study design regarding the absence of a control group. This could help contextualize the findings within the broader literature on neonatal resuscitation practices.</p><p>Expand the discussion on the implications of registry findings for neonatal care practices and policy, both within the DRC and globally. Highlighting specific variables that were not collected but are critical for improving neonatal outcomes could be particularly insightful.</p><p>Streamline the introductory and methodology sections to maintain a sharper focus on the study's objectives, findings, and implications. Reducing descriptive content that does not directly contribute to understanding the study's impact could enhance readability and engagement.</p><p>Provide a more detailed analysis of the barriers and facilitators encountered during the registry's implementation, including how these challenges were addressed or could be overcome in future research. Sharing lessons learned in this aspect could be extremely valuable to others looking to implement similar registries in low-resource settings.</p><p>Summary Statement:</p><p>This paper represents an important step forward in understanding and improving neonatal resuscitation practices in low-resource settings. The novel use of digital tools for data collection and the registry's alignment with international recommendations are notable strengths. However, to fully realize its potential impact, the paper could benefit from a more focused discussion on the implications of its findings, as well as a deeper analysis of the challenges encountered during implementation. With these enhancements, the paper could make a significant contribution to global health research and practice.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;Thank you for your submission.</p><p>It is crucial that feedback is provided to the ILCOR neonatal group so that any revision of the Utstein criteria can be updated whenever appropriate.</p><p>It is however &#x0201c;the hope of the Neonatal Utstein Working Group that, at minimum, all specified core data elements will be reported using the standardized definitions provided here.&#x0201d;</p><p>It would be useful to provide feedback not only about what data was difficult to collect, but in what way (if any) the authors planned to explore collecting more of the core data elements. Barriers to collection are crucial to discuss and solutions may need to be creative.</p><p>If this is not possible, it may be that the key components of this manuscript would be better published as a letter.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.

</p><p>January 24, 2025</p><p>Sebastian Schnaubelt, MD, PhD</p><p>Academic Editor</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr. Schnaubelt,</p><p>Thank you for your continued consideration of our manuscript, &#x0201c;Establishment of a neonatal resuscitation registry in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: An open cohort study&#x0201d; (PONE-D-24-30580). Following is a point-by-point response to the reviewer&#x02019;s comments to match the revised manuscript we have submitted.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Jackie K. Patterson, MD, MPH</p><p>Associate Professor of Pediatrics</p><p>Division of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine</p><p>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</p><p>Reviewer 2 Feedback:</p><p>1) Introduce a comparative analysis where possible, or discuss the limitations of the study design regarding the absence of a control group. This could help contextualize the findings within the broader literature on neonatal resuscitation practices.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Our access to a control group would be historically remote (using data from a former newborn resuscitation trial in these facilities conducted a few years prior) or retrospective (using medical record abstraction with little data on actual resuscitation care). As such, in our judgement, the potential comparators are not robust enough to draw conclusions. To address the lack of a comparator group, we added a sentence to the limitations section of the discussion:</p><p>&#x0201c;The study design did not include comparative analysis, which limits our understanding of the effect of establishing the registry.&#x0201d; (lines 349-350)</p><p>Of note, the third paragraph of the discussion section includes a comparison of our findings to our prior study in the DRC as well as prior literature from Tanzania and Uganda (lines 265-268).</p><p>2) Expand the discussion on the implications of registry findings for neonatal care practices and policy, both within the DRC and globally. Highlighting specific variables that were not collected but are critical for improving neonatal outcomes could be particularly insightful.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We expanded the discussion on implications of registry findings with attention to our findings of excessive suctioning and interruptions in PPV (lines 268-269), the subjectivity of evaluation of breathing (lines 300-302) and the need to expand the target population for evaluating quality resuscitation (lines 322-326). We also highlighted the lack of intrapartum data currently collected in the registry and the importance of addressing the intrapartum period to improve neonatal outcomes (lines 343-344).</p><p>3) Streamline the introductory and methodology sections to maintain a sharper focus on the study's objectives, findings, and implications. Reducing descriptive content that does not directly contribute to understanding the study's impact could enhance readability and engagement.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We revised the introductory and methodology sections per your suggestion to be more succinct and maintain a sharper focus.</p><p>4) Provide a more detailed analysis of the barriers and facilitators encountered during the registry's implementation, including how these challenges were addressed or could be overcome in future research. Sharing lessons learned in this aspect could be extremely valuable to others looking to implement similar registries in low-resource settings.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We re-organized the results section to cluster our analysis of barriers and facilitators in one paragraph, and bolstered this analysis with more detail regarding lessons learned (lines 183-199). We also added more detail to the discussion section regarding the burden of paper record-keeping (lines 246-249), the challenges around midwives consistently using NeoBeat (lines 352-355) and the resources involved in adding research staff to conduct observations with Liveborn (lines 361-362).</p><p>Reviewer 3 comments:</p><p>1) It is crucial that feedback is provided to the ILCOR neonatal group so that any revision of the Utstein criteria can be updated whenever appropriate. It is however &#x0201c;the hope of the Neonatal Utstein Working Group that, at minimum, all specified core data elements will be reported using the standardized definitions provided here.&#x0201d; It would be useful to provide feedback not only about what data was difficult to collect, but in what way (if any) the authors planned to explore collecting more of the core data elements. Barriers to collection are crucial to discuss and solutions may need to be creative. If this is not possible, it may be that the key components of this manuscript would be better published as a letter.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We added more detail regarding challenges with collecting certain data elements to the results section, with a focus on core data elements (lines 183-199; see response to #4 from reviewer 2). We also highlighted the new core variables we have since added to the registry in the discussion (lines 246-253).</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0324332.s007" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.pdf</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0324332.s007.pdf"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0324332.r006" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0324332.r006</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schnaubelt</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Sebastian Schnaubelt</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Sebastian Schnaubelt</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0324332" id="rel-obj006" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

</p><p>April 9, 2025</p><p>Sebastian Schnaubelt, MD, PhD</p><p>Academic Editor</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr. Schnaubelt,</p><p>Thank you for your continued consideration of our manuscript, &#x0201c;Establishment of a neonatal resuscitation registry in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: An open cohort study&#x0201d; (PONE-D-24-30580). Following is a point-by-point response to the reviewer&#x02019;s comments to match the revised manuscript we have submitted.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Jackie K. Patterson, MD, MPH</p><p>Associate Professor of Pediatrics</p><p>Division of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine</p><p>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</p><p>Reviewer 4 Feedback:</p><p>Methods</p><p>1. Were there any quality checks or inter-rater reliability checks given the diversity of background of raters (midwives, doctors, etc)?</p><p>Response:</p><p>We did not perform quality checks or inter-rater reliability of the observations. We added a sentence explicitly stating this in the limitations of the discussion (lines 377-379).</p><p>Of note, in the discussion, we detailed that Liveborn Observation app registrations were likely delayed and that observers with clinical responsibilities may have competing tasks; thus, we began restricting data collection to study nurses only. In the future directions in the last paragraph of the discussion, we mentioned our plans to validate the accuracy of observational data compared to audio-video recording, which is currently underway.</p><p>2. How were you handling missing data?</p><p>Response:</p><p>We queried all variables reported as unknown to try to capture as much data as possible. Responses that remained unknown after querying were treated as missing. We added the following sentences in lines 117-119: &#x0201c;All responses of &#x0201c;unknown&#x0201d; were queried to facilitate optimal data capture. Responses that remained unknown after querying were treated as missing.&#x0201d;</p><p>Results</p><p>3. Were there any differences in baseline characteristics between observed and non-observed newborns?</p><p>Response:</p><p>Yes, the observed population was less sick compared to the non-observed newborns. We have added Supplemental Table 1 to detail these differences and briefly summarized the differences in the results text as follows:</p><p>&#x0201c;The cohort we observed with the Liveborn app was biased towards a less sick</p><p>population with lower rates of Cesarean section (0.3% vs 2.2%), prematurity (12.5% vs</p><p>17.9% born at 28-36 weeks gestation), low birth weight (9.3% vs 12.8% birth weight</p><p>1500-2499g), APGAR 1min &#x02264; 5 (4.7% vs 7.4%), and neonatal deaths before discharge</p><p>(0.9% vs 2%) compared to those not observed [Supplemental Table 1].&#x0201d;</p><p>(Results, Lines 209-213)</p><p>4. It might be beneficial to see the differences between the two facilities.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Facility 2 cares for a sicker population compared to facility 1. We have added Supplemental Table 2 to detail these differences and have briefly summarized these differences in the results text as follows:</p><p>&#x0201c;Baseline characteristics by facility are notable for a sicker population at facility 2 with</p><p>higher rates of Cesarean section (2.6% vs 0%), birth weight &#x02264; 1499 grams (4.2% vs</p><p>0.4%) and 1500-2499 grams (13.6% vs 8.8%), 28-36 weeks gestation (20.1% vs 11%),</p><p>APGAR 1 min &#x02264; 5 (8.5% vs 3.9%), and stillbirths (2.9% vs 1.1%) along with a lower rate</p><p>of neonatal transfer to another facility (0.3% vs 2.1%) [Supplemental Table 2].&#x0201d;</p><p>(Results, Lines 214-218)</p><p>Of note, when our statistician was generating these two supplemental Tables, he noted a small error that the registry data was pulled from September 1, 2022 until August 30, 2023 instead of until August 31, 2023 (missing one day of data). All data now reflect that additional day of data to include a full year of the registry through August 31, 2023. We have updated the numbers in line 146, line 149, line 150, line 161, line 162, and Figure 2 accordingly. While the numbers changed slightly, the manuscript's conclusions remain the same.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>5. Lines 65-66: I believe you can describe the seven domains fully, otherwise it looks a bit incomplete.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We listed out the seven domains fully on lines 62-63.</p><p>Results, Table 1</p><p>6. Text describing Table 1 is fragmented (for example, it is separated by description of Figure 3). It would be easier to read the manuscript if all the fragments were put together.</p><p>Response:</p><p>In the published version of the manuscript, this legend will be placed directly beneath Figure 3 so that it does not separate the text describing Table 1.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0324332.s008" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers 4-9-25.pdf</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0324332.s008.pdf"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0324332.r008" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0324332.r008</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 3</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schnaubelt</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Sebastian Schnaubelt</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Sebastian Schnaubelt</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0324332" id="rel-obj008" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
