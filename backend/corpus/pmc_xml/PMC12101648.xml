Introduction</title><p>End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is the final stage among the five phases of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is characterized by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &#x0003c; 15&#x02009;mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Complications of ESKD include fluid retention, electrolyte abnormalities, cardiovascular disease, neurological abnormalities, chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD), and anemia. Neurological complications, such as cognitive deterioration, frequently occur in patients with ESKD. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The uremic toxins, anemia, vascular calcification, chronic inflammation, and intradialytic hypotension in patients with ESKD have been acknowledged as contributing factors for the development of neurological problems. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Kidney replacement therapy, including hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and kidney transplantation (KT), is the treatment of choice for patients with ESKD. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Because opportunities for KT are limited, most patients with ESKD undergo HD or PD. Compared to HD, PD results in fewer hemodynamic changes and better preservation of residual renal function. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, the disadvantages of using glucose-containing dialysates include weight gain and hyperglycemia. As each dialysis method has its own characteristics, its impact on neurological complications varies.</p><p>Functional brain connectivity refers to the patterns of interactions and communication between different brain regions, and aids in the comprehension of how various brain regions interact to perform specific functions. Several modalities, including resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] magnetic encephalography, [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] electroencephalography (EEG), [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and positron emission tomography [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] can be used to investigate functional brain connectivity. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a method for measuring functional brain connectivity and can precisely measure brain oxygen saturation. Recently, fNIRS has been used as an indicator of cerebral hemodynamics and functional brain connectivity. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] fNIRS is a safe and non-invasive technique that utilizes near-infrared rays and has excellent mobility, superior temporal resolution compared to MRI, and superior spatial resolution compared to EEG [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In a recent study using rs-fMRI to understand the mechanisms underlying neurological complications in patients with ESKD, patients with ESKD showed aberrant functional brain connectivity compared to healthy controls. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] One study compared structural and functional brain connectivity between PD and HD patients with ESKD using rs-fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and found that depending on the dialysis method, the brain connectivity changed differently compared to the healthy control group. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The different characteristics of PD and HD are thought to have influenced the different patterns of brain connectivity. Furthermore, when comparing patients with ESKD with and without cognitive impairment using fNIRS, we observed that functional brain connectivity in the prefrontal brain network was compromised. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, most studies have focused on patients with ESKD undergoing HD, and there is still limited research on functional brain connectivity in patients with ESKD undergoing PD.</p><p>Consequently, the purpose of this study was to examine, using fNIRS, the alteration of functional brain connectivity in patients with ESKD undergoing PD compared to a control group. We aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the neurological complications in patients with ESKD undergoing PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>2.

This assay quantifies oxyhemoglobin (HbO<sub>2</sub>) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) by utilizing the disparity in their respective near-infrared light absorption rates. Thirteen detectors and five sources comprised the NIRSIT Lite. Fifteen channels were used to identify fNIRS signals in the prefrontal cortex.

The acquisition of fNIRS data through the NIRSIT Lite was conducted during regular outpatient visits.

Discussion</title><p>In this study, we found a statistically significant difference in functional brain connectivity between patients with ESKD undergoing PD and healthy controls using fNIRS. Functional connectivity measures, namely average degree, average strength, and small-worldness, were lower in patients with ESKD undergoing PD than in healthy controls. Furthermore, substantial correlations were observed between the clinical variables and measures of functional brain connectivity.</p><p>The prevalence of cognitive impairment, a neurological complication in patients with ESKD, varies in the literature, with reported rates ranging from 16% to 38%. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The exact mechanisms underlying the cognitive impairment in patients with ESKD are poorly understood. However, as previously mentioned, factors such as uremic toxins, anemia, vascular calcification, chronic inflammation, and intradialytic hypotension influence the development of cognitive impairment in patients with ESKD. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Several studies have indicated that cognitive functional impairment, a complication of ESKD, improves after dialysis in patients with ESKD. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In a study comparing cognitive function at baseline in patients with ESKD with cognitive function 1 year after the initiation of dialysis, it was shown that patients undergoing PD exhibit greater improvement in cognitive function compared to those undergoing HD. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] HD is known to prescribe a more aggressive dialysis dose than PD and is associated with a higher frequency of hypotension during dialysis sessions. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, PD is considered to be more continuous and effective in removing uremic toxins and managing anemia. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] As it is thought that differences in dialysis modalities are thought to contribute to variations in cognitive function, investigating functional brain connectivity in patients with ESKD undergoing PD can be valuable for understanding the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment.</p><p>fNIRS can precisely measure the brain oxygen saturation using near-infrared spectroscopy. When more blood flows to an area of the brain, the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin increases, while that of deoxygenated hemoglobin decreases. fNIRS can measure variations in the levels of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin to determine changes in neural activity, because there is a strong association between changes in blood oxygenation and changes in neuronal activity. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Graph theory applied to the human brain is essentially a mathematical depiction of the actual brain architecture, where nodes represent different regions of the brain and edges represent the functional connections that connect them. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The application of graph theoretical analysis allows for a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of brain networks. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Using graph theory and fNIRS, we identified alterations in functional brain connectivity in patients with ESKD undergoing PD compared to healthy controls.</p><p>Our results revealed significant differences in the average degree, average strength, and small-worldness between patients with ESKD undergoing PD and healthy controls. Degree and strength are the basic measures of connectivity. The average strength of a node in a network is its average weighted degree, while the average degree is a measure of the number of edges relative to the number of nodes. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] A higher average strength may indicate stronger functional coupling between brain regions, suggesting increased coordination or communication among these regions. Therefore, decreased average degree and strength are accepted that functional connectivity between brain regions is diminished in patients with ESKD undergoing PD. A small-world network refers to a network topology characterized by short connections among a small number of nodes while also featuring relatively longer connections between certain nodes. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] This structure enables efficient information transfer through local clustering and global connectivity. In the context of brain networks, small-worldness is associated with network efficiency and is contingent on the average shortest path length and global transitivity of the network. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Therefore, the decreased small-worldness in the functional brain connectivity of patients with ESKD undergoing PD indicates that the efficiency of the brain network has declined. In conclusion, due to the decrease in basic network measures and small-worldness, functional brain connectivity was significantly reduced in patients with ESKD undergoing PD compared to controls.</p><p>In this study, significant correlations were observed between clinical variables and measures of functional brain connectivity. Moreover, Kt/V and eccentricity demonstrated a negative correlation. Kt/V can be calculated as the dialyzer clearance multiplied by time divided by the distribution volume of urea, which represents the adequacy of dialysis. Eccentricity is defined as the maximum distance of one node from other nodes, and is negatively correlated with network integration. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Higher eccentricity in patients with ESKD undergoing PD indicates reduced functional integration. These results indicate that an increase in Kt/V is associated with an improvement in functional brain connectivity.</p><p>HDL-C levels were negatively correlated with assortativity. High HDL-C levels protect against cardiovascular diseases and play a role in preventing damage to the central nervous system. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Assortativity serves as a significant metric for assessing the resilience of a network by revealing whether nodes are densely connected to other nodes to comparable degrees or to those with significantly divergent degrees. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] A positive assortativity value indicates an assortative network, whereas a negative value indicates a disassortative network. Compared to disassortative networks, assortative networks are more vulnerable to random attacks, and the transmission of information is considerably less efficient. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Thus, a decrease in HDL-C levels is associated with a assortative network, indicating that the functional brain network is inefficient.</p><p>Hemoglobin levels were negatively correlated with modularity. Anemia is a well-known risk factor for neurological complications in patients with ESKD. However, an association between high hemoglobin concentrations and cognitive impairment has been reported. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] The result demonstrated a non-linear relationship between hemoglobin levels and cognitive function. The density of connections inside a module or community is measured by the term &#x0201c;modularity,&#x0201d; which is a measure of a graph&#x02019;s structure. It measures functional segregation, which is the capacity of specialized processing to occur within clusters of densely interconnected brain regions. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In this study, we showed a negative correlation between hemoglobin levels and the functional segregation of the brain.</p><p>Phosphate levels were positively correlated with eccentricity and negatively correlated with small-worldness. In patients with ESKD, chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) occurs as a complication, and hyperphosphatemia is a characteristic feature. Hyperphosphatemia can influence the occurrence of neurological complications such as stroke, dementia, and cognitive impairment. [<xref rid="pone.0323319.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] As mentioned earlier, eccentricity is negatively correlated with functional integration, and small-worldness is associated with the efficiency of the brain network. Consequently, an increase in phosphate levels can be interpreted as an impairment of functional brain connectivity by reducing functional integration and compromising network efficiency.</p><p>This study has some limitations that warrant discussion. First, this study was conducted at a single center with an insufficient number of participants. Therefore, large-scale studies are required to obtain statistically significant results. Second, to reduce bias in the research results, fNIRS measurements at the same PD duration and additional information about patients, such as medication status, are required to properly interpret the research results. Since the comparison was made between patients with ESKD undergoing PD and healthy controls, the loss of functional brain connectivity may have been overestimated. To assess the impact of PD on functional brain connectivity in patients with ESKD, it would be helpful to measure and compare at the time point of PD initiation and subsequent pre-established time points. In addition, patients with any prior neurological or psychiatric diseases were excluded from the experimental group, but if imaging tests such as CT or MRI or vascular examinations had been conducted, underlying conditions that could introduce bias into the study could have been definitively excluded. Third, the NIRSIT Lite machine could only collect fNIRS data from the frontal lobe. However, because cognitive dysfunction is primarily associated with the frontal lobe, it is easy to interpret the results of this study.

Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated significant alterations in functional brain connectivity in patients with ESKD undergoing PD. This suggests that functional brain connectivity was significantly reduced in patients with ESKD undergoing PD compared to healthy controls. Additionally, substantial correlations were observed between some clinical variables and measures of functional brain connectivity. The results of this study are expected to help explain the mechanism of neurological complications in patients with ESKD undergoing PD, allowing for a clearer understanding of the mechanism and discussion of treatment in future studies. In future studies, measuring changes in functional brain connectivity using fNIRS in ESKD patients undergoing HD and comparing them with patients with ESKD undergoing PD would help further understand the mechanisms involved.</p></sec><sec id="sec013" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323319.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Correlation analysis of clinical factors and functional brain connectivity.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323319.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the staff of nephrology department for their assistance in conducting this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0323319.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Chapter 1: Definition and classification of CKD</article-title>. <source>Kidney Int Suppl (2011)</source>. <year>2013</year>;<volume>3</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>19</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>62</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1038/kisup.2012.64</pub-id>

</p><p>We would like to thank for the editor and reviewers of the PLOS One for taking their time to review our article. We made some corrections and clarifications in the manuscript after going over the reviewers&#x02019; comments, again.</p><p>We hope the revised manuscript will better meet the requirements of the PLOS One for publication. We would like to thank you once again for the constructive review by the reviewers and editor.</p><p>#Reviewer 1</p><p>The article is a study examining the neurological effects and brain connectivity in peritoneal dialysis patients, and it is one of the conditions that is frequently encountered in daily practice and is not always easy to manage. I have a few suggestions for this interesting study.</p><p>The patients were evaluated by a neurologist, Were any imaging modalities done? (CT? MRI?) I did not see any additional information in this regard. Especially since prefrontal area data can be collected, have there been tests that can show dysfunction of this domain? Were vascular examinations performed in both groups?</p><p>: Thank you for your wonderful review. Unfortunately, our study did not include imaging modalities such as CT or MRI. However, patients with any prior neurological or psychiatric diseases were excluded from the experimental group. If imaging tests had been conducted, we believe we could have more definitively ruled out neurological issues. This is discussed in the limitations.</p><p>The MoCA-K used in this study is a test that reflects dysfunction in the prefrontal area. While it is a screening tool for cognitive impairment, it includes several items that assess executive function and attention, which can reflect the function of the frontal lobe. We recruited patients without a neurological history, and the average MoCA-K score was 24, which is above the threshold of 22 that suggests cognitive impairment, and no correlation with functional brain connectivity was observed. Vascular examination was not conducted in either group, which is also mentioned as a limitation.</p><p>I was able to examine the biochemistry values of the patient group, but I could not see the healthy group. Was it not looked at or shared? It is probably planned to increase the number, but I think it would strengthen the hypothesis if there was a third group receiving HD. I believe that these feedbacks should be made.</p><p>: The control group consisted of individuals without underlying diseases and with no health issues. Since the study aimed to investigate the correlation between laboratory data and functional brain connectivity in patients with ESKD undergoing PD, laboratory data from healthy controls were not collected.</p><p>By measuring changes in functional brain connectivity using fNIRS in ESKD patients undergoing hemodialysis and comparing them, it would be possible to better understand the mechanisms through which PD affects neurological complications in ESKD patients in comparison to HD. I agree with your opinion, and this has been added as a limitation in the study.</p><p>#Reviewer 2</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that gives us more information about the potential mechanisms of cognitive decay among people with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) undergoing PD. The study is well conceived, but in my view, comparing people undergoing PD with healthy controls may overestimate the loss of brain connectivity. This could be addressed by evaluating people with ESKD at the onset of PD and then at pre-established time points, hence making each participant her or his control.
