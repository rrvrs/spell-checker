Introduction</title><p>Cancer is defined by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells, with the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize throughout the body [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Key factors in cancer progression include the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, overexpression of oncogenes, genomic instability, genetic and epigenetic mutations, alterations in the tumor microenvironment, dysregulated intracellular signaling pathways, and defective apoptosis [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In 2022, approximately 20 million new cancer cases were reported globally, alongside 9.7 million cancer-related deaths. Lung cancer remains the most diagnosed type, accounting for 12.4% of all cases (around 2.5 million) and 18.7% of cancer deaths (about 1.8 million) [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While around 90% of lung cancer cases are linked to smoking and tobacco use, environmental and genetic factors, including exposure to radon gas, asbestos, air pollution, chronic infections, and hereditary predispositions, also contribute to its development [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Current treatments for lung cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies, with recommendations depending on the cancer&#x02019;s type and stage [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite advancements in diagnosis and treatment, lung cancer prognosis remains poor, and responses to conventional therapies are often limited, except in cases of localized tumors. A deeper understanding of lung cancer biology may lead to more effective and targeted treatments [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Chemotherapy and radiotherapy, while commonly used, are associated with significant side effects, high costs, and limited effectiveness due to toxicities [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This underscores the urgent need for safer and more effective chemotherapeutic agents. Phytochemicals, natural bioactive compounds derived from plants, have emerged as promising alternatives. Several phytochemicals, such as camptothecin, vincristine, and paclitaxel, have been successfully developed for their potent anticancer properties and are now widely used in clinical practice [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>BL is a water-soluble glycopeptide antibiotic with a molecular weight of approximately 1500 Da (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00254-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). The form commonly administered, BL sulfate, is used as a chemotherapeutic agent in cancer treatment [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, BL is associated with serious side effects, including pulmonary toxicity, nephrotoxicity, and gastrointestinal distress. Patients undergoing BL therapy often experience significant physical and psychological distress, negatively impacting their quality of life. Thus, developing therapeutic strategies that reduce BL&#x02019;s toxicity while enhancing its efficacy is crucial for improving patient outcomes [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In developed countries, nearly half of all cancer patients use complementary and alternative therapies alongside conventional treatments [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Among these, plant-based treatments have been widely used for various diseases, including cancer. Plants have historically been used for multiple purposes, from nutrition and cosmetics to therapeutic applications, and have played a key role in the development of pharmaceutical products [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recently, natural phytochemicals have gained attention for their accessibility, affordability, low toxicity, and minimal side effects, offering potential solutions to the limitations of conventional therapies [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Natural compounds are increasingly being explored for their therapeutic potential in drug development due to their structural diversity and promising clinical outcomes. Many of these compounds exhibit anticancer and antioxidant properties, making them valuable candidates for novel cancer therapies [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Certain plant-based agents are known to influence cancer-related signaling pathways, regulate gene expression, and modulate cell cycle and apoptosis. Proteomic studies have shown that some plant-derived compounds affect proteins involved in these pathways, inducing apoptosis in cancer cells [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Citrus fruits, such as oranges, lemons, and limes, are recognized for their health benefits and chemopreventive properties. One of the key bioactive compounds in these fruits is hesperidin (Hesp), a flavonoid derived from hesperetin. Hesp (3&#x02032;,5,7-trihydroxy-4&#x02032;-methoxyflavanone-7-6-O-&#x003b1;-L-rhamnosyl-D-glucose) is a natural flavonoid abundant in various fruits and vegetables [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00254-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). A wide range of pharmacological activities of Hesp has been reported, including potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and anticancer properties [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Hesp prevents malignant transformation and cancer progression by targeting molecular mechanisms involved in tumor cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis through upregulation of Bax and caspase-3, downregulation of Bcl-2, and stimulation of NF-&#x003ba;B and AKT/mTOR signaling pathways [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Two different studies have shown that Hesp exhibits therapeutic effects against BL-induced pulmonary fibrosis in male Sprague Dawley rats by regulating inflammatory markers through inhibition of the TGF-&#x003b2;1/Smad3/AMPK and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;/NF-&#x003ba;B pathways [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], as well as by regulating lung inflammatory markers TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, and inducing Nrf-2 [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In a recent study using MRC-5 lung fibroblast cells, Hesp was reported to prevent lung fibroblast senescence in vitro via downregulation of the expression of senescence marker proteins (p53, p21 and p16) and inhibition of the IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway, and also to alleviate BL-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this study is to investigate the synergistic effects of Hesp and BL on cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and angiogenesis in A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells. A549 cells were cultured and treated, after which the antiproliferative, apoptotic, autophagic, and anti-angiogenic effects of the treatments were evaluated. Additionally, key protein expression levels involved in apoptotic and autophagic pathways were analyzed. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of this combined therapy and contribute to the development of new, targeted cancer treatments with improved selectivity and efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-pharmaceuticals-18-00254"><title>2.

Hesp, BL and Their Combination Reduces Viability of A549 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells in a Dose-Dependent Manner</title><p>The antiproliferative effects of Hesp, BL, and their combination on A549 lung cancer cells were evaluated using the WST-1 cell viability assay. A reduction in A549 cell viability was observed after 24 h of treatment with both Hesp and BL, particularly at higher concentrations (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00254-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). At a concentration of 100 &#x000b5;M, cell viability decreased by 68.53% for Hesp-treated cells and 83.35% for BL-treated cells compared to untreated controls. After 24 h of treatment, the IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated as 82.85 &#x000b1; 2.91 &#x000b5;M for Hesp and 70.12 &#x000b1; 0.91 &#x000b5;M for BL.</p><p>After 48 h of treatment, a significant reduction in cell viability was noted at concentrations of 40 &#x000b5;M and above for both Hesp and BL (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00254-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). At 100 &#x000b5;M, the proliferation of Hesp-treated cells was inhibited by 97.56%, while BL-treated cells showed a 98.02% inhibition compared to the control group.

Combination of Hesp and BL Exhibits Synergistic Interaction</title><p>Concentrations of 12.5 &#x000b5;M for Hesp and 7.5 &#x000b5;M for BL were used to determine the combination index for the Hesp + BL treatment, which were approximately half of the IC<sub>50</sub> values obtained after 72 h of exposure. The absorbance values of cells treated with only 12.5 &#x000b5;M Hesp or 7.5 &#x000b5;M BL were normalized to 100% viability for calculation purposes. A549 cells were treated for 72 h with increasing concentrations of BL, while the Hesp concentration remained constant at 12.5 &#x000b5;M. This combination was found to decrease cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, in line with the increasing BL concentration (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00254-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). In the presence of 12.5 &#x000b5;M Hesp, the IC<sub>50</sub> value of BL was determined to be 7.58 &#x000b1; 0.32 &#x000b5;M. Similarly, when A549 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of Hesp combined with a constant 7.5 &#x000b5;M BL for 72 h, the inhibition of cell proliferation increased in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00254-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). Under these conditions, the IC<sub>50</sub> value of Hesp was found to be 9.95 &#x000b1; 0.80 &#x000b5;M.</p><p>Combining a therapeutic drug with a herbal agent can enhance treatment effectiveness by targeting different cellular mechanisms or pathways [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For a combination therapy to be considered synergistic, several beneficial outcomes should be observed, such as increased therapeutic efficacy, maintaining or improving the same efficacy at lower doses, reducing or preventing drug resistance, and achieving selective synergy against a specific target or mechanism. These synergistic effects are the foundation for the widespread use of drug combinations, significantly improving treatment outcomes for serious diseases like cancer [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Hesp, BL and Their Combination Inhibits the Migration of A549 Cells</title><p>The wound-healing assay is one of the widely used techniques developed to study in vitro cell migration, simulating the process that occurs during wound healing in vivo. The primary steps involve creating a &#x0201c;wound&#x0201d; in a cell monolayer, capturing images at the start and at regular intervals as the cells migrate to close the wound, and then comparing these images to assess the migration rate.

In addition to regulating the cell cycle, p21 is involved in transcriptional modulation.

Discussion</title><p>Lung cancer, characterized by genetic and epigenetic changes that drive clonal expansion and ultimately lead to invasive cancer, remains a significant clinical challenge due to its heterogeneity and late-stage diagnosis [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), the most prevalent form, accounts for approximately 85% of cases and includes diverse subtypes such as squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Despite advances in surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, the 5-year survival rate for NSCLC remains low, particularly in advanced-stage diagnoses [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This highlights the urgent need for more effective and targeted therapies that can overcome resistance and reduce toxicity. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of BL and Hesp on A549 NSCLC cells, focusing on the induction of apoptosis, autophagy, and angiogenesis inhibition. Our results demonstrate a clear synergistic effect of BL and Hesp in promoting cell death through both apoptotic and autophagic pathways, suggesting that Hesp enhances the therapeutic potential of BL, a chemotherapy agent widely used in the treatment of various cancers [<xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The term &#x02018;regulated cell death&#x02019; (RCD) is used to refer to cell death that can be influenced by certain genetic or pharmacological interventions [<xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Apoptosis, one of the subtypes of RCD, is an essential defense mechanism against cancer progression, enabling the removal of damaged or mutated cells that could otherwise lead to malignancy. However, many cancer cells, including those in lung cancer, develop strategies to evade apoptosis, resulting in uncontrolled proliferation and tumor growth [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Our study revealed that the combination of Hesp with BL significantly enhanced the expression of critical apoptotic markers, including p53, p21, Bax, and cPARP, the latter being a hallmark of caspase-mediated apoptosis. Notably, p53, a tumor suppressor pivotal in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, was upregulated in response to the combination therapy compared to BL alone, indicating that Hesp augments BL&#x02019;s ability to activate the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This was further supported by the observed increases in Bax expression, and cPARP levels, demonstrating robust apoptotic activation. In addition to apoptosis, autophagy, a cellular recycling process triggered under stress conditions, plays a dual role in cancer, either promoting survival or inducing autophagic cell death when cellular stress becomes excessive [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our findings indicated that the combination of BL and Hesp significantly increased Beclin-1 expression, a central regulator of autophagy, suggesting that autophagy was induced in A549 cells. This induction implies that autophagy contributed to the cell death process, potentially interacting with apoptotic pathways to amplify the therapeutic effects. These results align with previous studies showing that Hesp can simultaneously modulate apoptosis and autophagy, thereby enhancing the efficacy of conventional cancer treatments. Together, the dual activation of these pathways by the BL-Hesp combination underscores its potential as a synergistic strategy for lung cancer therapy, offering a promising avenue for further research and therapeutic development.</p><p>The synergistic interaction between BL and Hesp can be attributed to their complementary mechanisms of action. BL induces DNA damage by binding to DNA and creating strand breaks, primarily at GC-rich regions [<xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Hesp, a natural flavonoid with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties, modulates several signaling pathways, including those related to apoptosis and autophagy. Studies have demonstrated that Hesp can induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and promoting the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax [<xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In our study, the combination of BL and Hesp appeared to enhance DNA damage, leading to a greater activation of apoptotic and autophagic processes compared to BL alone. This suggests that Hesp amplifies BL&#x02019;s DNA-damaging effects while simultaneously triggering additional pro-death pathways.</p><p>Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key mediator of angiogenesis in cancer, and its inhibition is a common therapeutic target [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our results showed that the BL + Hesp combination significantly reduced VEGF levels in A549 cells, indicating that this treatment inhibits angiogenesis. This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the anti-angiogenic properties of Hesp in various cancer models [<xref rid="B37-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. By reducing VEGF expression, the combination therapy may limit the tumor&#x02019;s ability to sustain growth and metastasize, further enhancing its therapeutic potential.</p><p>The use of phytochemicals such as Hesp in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic agents offers a promising approach to reducing the side effects of chemotherapy while enhancing efficacy. BL is known to cause significant toxicity, including pulmonary and gastrointestinal side effects, limiting its therapeutic window [<xref rid="B38-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The addition of Hesp not only potentiates the anticancer effects of BL but also may allow for lower doses of BL to be used, reducing the likelihood of adverse effects. Importantly, Hesp has been shown to be safe in both preclinical and clinical settings, with no significant toxicity reported even at high doses [<xref rid="B39-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-pharmaceuticals-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These findings suggest that the combination of BL and Hesp could represent a more tolerable and effective treatment option for lung cancer patients. Although our study provides strong evidence of the synergistic effects of BL and Hesp on NSCLC cells, further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of this interaction (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00254-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). In particular, in vivo studies are essential to assess the therapeutic potential and safety of this combination in a clinical setting.

The cell lysate was incubated on ice for 10 min before centrifugation and centrifuged at 10.000 x g in a refrigerated centrifuge (Universal 320R, Hettich) for 1 min. An amount of 50 &#x000b5;L of the supernatant was taken into a clean tube, and reaction buffer containing 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) was added and incubated on ice for 30 more min. Cell lysate (50 &#x000b5;L) and 50 &#x000b5;L reaction buffer mixture containing 10 mM DTT was transferred to wells of a 96-well microplate. An amount of 5 &#x000b5;L of 4 mM DEVD&#x02014;pNA substrate was added to each well (to a final concentration of 200 &#x000b5;M), and then, it was incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 2 h. Absorbance values were recorded at 405 nm with the aid of a microplate reader (SpectraMax Plus 384, Molecular Devices). The values obtained were expressed in terms of fold change compared to the untreated control group.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot11-pharmaceuticals-18-00254"><title>4.11. Determination of Protein Expression Levels by Western Blot</title><p>For Western blot analysis, 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells for each group were inoculated in 6 cm Petri dishes, and treatments were administered after an overnight incubation. Following a 24 h treatment period, cells were harvested and lysed on ice in cold RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors.

Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates that the combination of Hesp with BL significantly enhances the antiproliferative, apoptotic, autophagic, and anti-angiogenic effects in A549 cells. The combination therapy led to a substantial increase in key apoptotic markers such as p53, p21, Bax, and cPARP, indicating a robust activation of apoptosis, particularly through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Additionally, the upregulation of Beclin-1 suggests that autophagy was also induced, potentially contributing to the overall cell death process. The observed reduction in VEGF levels further highlights the anti-angiogenic potential of this treatment, which could help inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. The synergistic effects of Hesp and BL suggest that combining traditional chemotherapy with natural compounds can improve therapeutic efficacy while potentially reducing the side effects associated with high-dose chemotherapy. Given the low toxicity and safety profile of Hesp, this combination represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung cancer and possibly other cancers. The primary limitation of this study is its focus on a single lung cancer cell line. Conducting future research using a broader range of lung cancer cell lines will be crucial to reinforcing these conclusions. Nonetheless, the combination of Hesp with BL presents a promising strategy that could improve treatment outcomes while offering a more tolerable therapeutic option for lung cancer patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>First of all, we would like to thank Bingol University Cancer Research Laboratory staff, especially Ramazan Gundogdu, for their support and for facilitating the laboratory work.
