This study examined relationships among perceived coach support, received coach support, coach&#x02013;athlete relationship, self&#x02010;confidence, and psychological wellbeing. A further aim was to identify mechanisms through which coach&#x02013;athlete relationship influences self&#x02010;confidence and psychological wellbeing. A total of 537 athletes (Mage&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;21.83 and SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.67) from a range of sports completed measures of perceived coach support, received coach support, coach&#x02013;athlete relationship, self&#x02010;confidence, and psychological wellbeing. Mediation analysis revealed a significant direct effect of coach&#x02013;athlete relationship on perceived coach support (<italic toggle="yes">b</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.44 and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.04) and received coach support on psychological wellbeing (<italic toggle="yes">b</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.94 and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x0003c;0.05). Coach&#x02013;athlete relationship was associated with a significant indirect effect on psychological wellbeing via received coach support (ab = 0.82 and 95% CI [0.40 and 1.26*]) but not perceived coach support. In contrast, coach&#x02013;athlete relationship was associated with a significant indirect effect on self&#x02010;confidence via perceived coach support (ab&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.16 and 95% CI [0.10 and 0.22*]) but not received coach support. These findings demonstrate the significant role perceived coach support and received coach support plays in potentially explaining the relationship between the coach&#x02013;athlete relationship with self&#x02010;confidence and psychological wellbeing. Additionally, the results highlight that different forms of social support uniquely mediate the relationship among the coach&#x02013;athlete relationship, confidence, and wellbeing. These results have implications for coaching practices, as coaches can use their relationships with athletes to provide optimal support and thereby enhance the athletes' self&#x02010;confidence and wellbeing.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="highlights"><title>Highlights</title><p>

For many athletes, the coach is a key provider of social support (Freeman,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). The confidence and psychological wellbeing of athletes are of great concern to coaches who look to nurture positive and impactful relationships (Forlenza et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Peng et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Although the coach&#x02013;athlete relationship and social support are associated with increased self&#x02010;confidence and wellbeing (e.g., Freeman &#x00026; Rees,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Simons &#x00026; Bird,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>), no studies have examined coach&#x02013;athlete relationship and perceived support and received support simultaneously in the same study. Further research examining social support in relation to coach&#x02013;athlete relationships is vital to help understand potential mechanisms underpinning confidence and wellbeing and distinguish nuances that may exist in support provision. The current study addresses this gap in knowledge by examining the influence of coach&#x02013;athlete relationships and the mediating role of social support in enhancing confidence and wellbeing.</p><p>Self&#x02010;confidence plays a significant role in athlete performance, motivation, and overall wellbeing (Vealey &#x00026; Chase,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Self&#x02010;confidence is defined as a belief in one's ability to successfully execute desired actions and achieve desired outcomes (Vealey,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Research has shown that higher levels of self&#x02010;confidence are associated with improved performance outcomes (e.g., Woodman &#x00026; Hardy,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0054" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Athletes with higher self&#x02010;confidence are likely to experience lower levels of anxiety, although feeling a sense of control and satisfaction (e.g., Craft et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Confident athletes are also more likely to set challenging goals, persevere in the face of setbacks, and experience a greater sense of fulfillment and enjoyment in their sport (Woodman &#x00026; Hardy,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0054" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Coaches can play a role in this as overly critical and unsupportive coaches decreased athletes' self&#x02010;confidence (Bruner et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), whereas when athletes feel a stronger coach&#x02013;athlete relationship, confidence is enhanced (Gencer &#x00026; &#x000d6;zt&#x000fc;rk,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Thus, self&#x02010;confidence serves as a vital component of athletes' psychological wellbeing as well as contributing to overall performance.</p><p>The wellbeing of athletes is of paramount importance, as it significantly influences their overall health and performance and contributes to flourishing (e.g., Lundqvist,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Psychological wellbeing refers to an individual's overall mental health and positive functioning across various domains of life (Kumar et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Although the significance of psychological wellbeing is widely recognized for overall quality of life (Camfield &#x00026; Skevington,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), its specific prevalence and determinants within athletic populations warrant further investigation. Some factors can pose challenges to athletes' wellbeing including elevated levels of stress, competitive anxiety, overtraining, and burnout (e.g., McLoughlin et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Conversely, factors such as perceived ability, self&#x02010;esteem, and coping skills have shown potential in enhancing athletes' psychological wellbeing (e.g., Gould et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). One construct that is crucial in promoting wellbeing is social support.</p><p>Social support is defined as &#x0201c;the social resources that persons perceive to be available, or that are actually provided to them by non&#x02010;professionals, in the context of both formal support groups and informal helping relationships&#x0201d; (Cohen et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, p. 4). Social support incorporates both structural and functional components (Lakey,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The structural component of support relates to the number and type of relationships available in one's network (e.g., the coach as a support provider; Freeman,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). The functional component comprises of perceived support and received support. Perceived support refers to appraisals of support availability, whereas received support refers to an assessment of the amount of support obtained usually over a given period of time (Vangelisti,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Although perceived support and received support are similar in nature, they are statistically and conceptually distinct, with a shared variance of between 12% and 19% (e.g., Haber et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Perceived support represents a dispositional interpretation of available support, whereas received support reflects objectively identifiable actions of support (Haber et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>Both received support and perceived support have been found to positively influence psychological outcomes. For example, a meta&#x02010;analysis demonstrated that both perceived support (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.31) and received support (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.22) exert moderate effects on mental health outcomes in emergency support workers (Prati et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). However, other research has highlighted differences in how these two types of support relate to other variables. For example, Uchino&#x000a0;(<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) found that perceived support is more consistently related to positive health outcomes than received support. The majority of research tends to focus on either perceived support or received support independently, although it is critical that both are examined concurrently to fully understand their individual relationships with psychological outcomes. Furthermore, only a limited amount of research on both perceived support and received support exists in sport, and studies are yet to examine these types of support in relation to coach support and the wellbeing of athletes.</p><p>Within the social support literature, there are two predominant theories to explain how social support exerts beneficial effects: (a) stress&#x02010;buffering model and (b) main effects model (Cohen et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The stress&#x02010;buffering model suggests social support buffers the potential negative effects of stress (Cohen,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). There is some evidence for stress&#x02010;buffering effects in sport although this is equivocal, as when both perceived support and received support were examined simultaneously, only received support was associated with stress&#x02010;buffering effects on self&#x02010;confidence (Rees &#x00026; Freeman,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In comparison, the main effects model suggests direct beneficial effects of social support irrespective of stress levels (Cohen et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). In sport, main effects for both perceived support and received support were reported in relation to performance (Freeman &#x00026; Rees,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), although this has not yet been shown for coach support specifically. The current study examines the role of perceived coach support and received coach support in reference to the main effects model, as this model has stronger evidence for the beneficial effects of social support across health (Lakey &#x00026; Orehek,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and sport (Freeman &#x00026; Rees,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>One key factor influencing coaching effectiveness is the quality of the coach&#x02013;athlete relationship (Jowett,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The coach&#x02013;athlete relationship is defined as a social situation in which coaches' and athletes' perceived closeness (affective bond between individuals), commitment (intention in the dyad to maintain the relationship), and complementarity (interactions that underline cooperation) are interdependent (Jowett &#x00026; Ntoumanis,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Although the coach&#x02013;athlete relationship and social support are conceptually related, they are distinct constructs. For example, both constructs are underpinned by an interaction between individuals and the perceptions of these interactions (Cohen et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). However, these constructs differ at the level at which they operate; social support encompasses perceived or received resources an individual experiences (Lakey,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), whereas the coach&#x02013;athlete relationship pertains to an evaluation of the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral quality of a relationship (Jowett &#x00026; Ntoumanis,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Therefore, coach&#x02013;athlete relationship could be considered a higher order construct with social&#x000a0;support being a key behavior that maintains the quality of relationships.</p><p>Positive coach&#x02013;athlete relationships are associated with more favorable psychological outcomes for athletes. Indeed, coach leadership behaviors work synergistically with coach&#x02013;athlete relationship to improve developmental experience (Vella et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). There is limited empirical research examining the relationship between perceived support and coach&#x02013;athlete relationship, although preliminary data suggest they are related. For example, Simons and Bird&#x000a0;(<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>) found that coach&#x02013;athlete relationship constructs (closeness, commitment, and complementarity) positively correlated to different types of social support (i.e., tangible, emotional, informational, and esteem). These findings suggest that the coach&#x02013;athlete relationship influences the types of support provided to athletes, although this has yet been established for received support.</p><p>Coaches are often important role models to athletes and can bolster athlete self&#x02010;confidence through guidance, encouragement, and support (Lopez de Subijana et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Coaches play a role in developing a nurturing environment to develop positive interpersonal relationships with their athletes, which contributes to building confidence (Forlenza et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that perceived support from teammates boosts athlete self&#x02010;confidence (Freeman &#x00026; Rees,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and both perceived and received support are crucial for self&#x02010;confidence (Rees &#x00026; Freeman,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Despite the importance of coaches to athletes, neither of the aforementioned studies directly examined coach support or considered other potentially influential factors such as the coach&#x02013;athlete relationship.</p><p>Alongside self&#x02010;confidence, perceptions of support have also been associated with improved psychological wellbeing in college level students (Adyani et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and athletes (Simons &#x00026; Bird,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Furthermore, autonomy support by a coach contributes to athletes' subjective wellbeing (Lafreni&#x000e8;re et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Nuance and limitations exist with this research though. For example, when perceived support and received support were considered in the same study involving student&#x02010;athletes, received support was associated with psychological wellbeing, whereas perceived support was not (Katagami &#x00026; Tsuchiya,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Simons and Bird&#x000a0;(<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>) examined perceptions of coach support only rather than examining both perceived and received coach support simultaneously. The equivocal nature of the relationship between perceived support and received support with athletes' psychological wellbeing warrants further investigation, specifically in relation to coach support.</p><p>Beyond establishing an association among perceived coach support, received coach support, coach&#x02013;athlete relationship, self&#x02010;confidence, and psychological wellbeing, it is vital to examine the specific mechanisms through which perceived and received support operate to help advance theory and develop more effective interventions (Sarason &#x00026; Sarason,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Few studies have examined potential mediators underpinning coach&#x02013;athlete relationships with outcomes, such as wellbeing, despite evidence suggesting they are related and may influence athlete outcomes (Simons &#x00026; Bird,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). In particular, the positive relationship between coach&#x02013;athlete relationship and athlete outcomes may be influenced by the support provided and received from the coach.

In support of hypothesis 1, correlational analyses found significant positive relationships between all variables. The second aim was to investigate perceived coach support and received coach support as potential mediators influencing the relationship between coach&#x02013;athlete relationship with psychological wellbeing and self&#x02010;confidence. Hypothesis 2 was partially supported as the coach&#x02013;athlete relationship is associated with a significant indirect effect on psychological wellbeing via received coach support but not perceived coach support. Conversely, the coach&#x02013;athlete relationship is associated with a significant indirect effect on self&#x02010;confidence via perceived coach support but not received coach support.</p><p>Bivariate correlations showed that both perceived coach support and received coach support were significantly correlated with psychological wellbeing; however, when considered simultaneously in the mediation analysis, only received coach support emerged as a significant predictor of psychological wellbeing. This finding highlights the importance of examining multiple types of support simultaneously to identify optimal practice recommendations for coaches in sport settings. Received support was a significant predictor of psychological wellbeing in the current study, which aligns with evidence from social psychology (Dadvand et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and the current study extends this understanding specifically to athletes, suggesting that received coach support influences the relationship between coach&#x02013;athlete relationship and psychological wellbeing.</p><p>Contrary to previous research (e.g., Simons &#x00026; Bird,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>), the current study found that perceived coach support did not predict psychological wellbeing. However, these findings may be explained by the analytical approach adopted by the current study. Specifically, the current study simultaneously considered both perceived coach support and received coach support, whereas previous research has mainly examined perceived or received social support in isolation (e.g., Simons &#x00026; Bird,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Consequently, unlike previous research, we were able to control for, and observe, the unique contributions of perceived and received social support in relation to our outcome variables. This suggests that received social support and perceived social support have distinct relationships with different outcome variables in sport contexts. It has been suggested that received support may be context specific as unwarranted support can be perceived as unhelpful or a threat to independence (Bolger &#x00026; Amarel,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). A potential explanation for why only received coach support predicted psychological wellbeing could be unique to coach support. For example, coaches may be key providers of support for athletes in sporting contexts (e.g., Freeman,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) and receiving more tangible forms of support from these individuals may be critical to athlete wellbeing rather than perceiving coach support to be available. Furthermore, when received support is deemed particularly needed, its relationship with mental health is stronger (Melrose et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), suggesting that in the current sample, receiving coach support was deemed necessary for increased psychological wellbeing.</p><p>The findings of the current study extend the work of Simons and Bird&#x000a0;(<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>) by demonstrating that coach&#x02013;athlete relationship is also associated with overall psychological wellbeing beyond sport&#x02010;related wellbeing. When included in the mediation analysis, coach&#x02013;athlete relationship indirectly predicted psychological wellbeing via perceived coach support and received coach support. This finding suggests that the way coach&#x02013;athlete relationship influences outcomes is through social support. In comparison, Simons and Bird&#x000a0;(<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>) found that coach&#x02013;athlete relationship positively predicted psychological wellbeing in athletes. The current findings provide a more nuanced understanding of these relationships whereby received coach support influences the relationship between coach&#x02013;athlete relationship and psychological wellbeing. Further research examining both perceived support and received support alongside coach&#x02013;athlete relationship as potential predictors of psychological wellbeing is required. The current results suggest that it is not the relationship that is key in facilitating wellbeing in athletes but rather the extent to which athletes feel supported. These findings emphasize the crucial role that a coach plays in being a support provider to athletes and the wider beneficial effects on their wellbeing.</p><p>The results of this study underscore the pivotal role that coaches play in shaping athletes' self&#x02010;confidence, echoing the findings of Freeman et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Notably, perceived coach support emerged as a positive predictor of self&#x02010;confidence, with higher levels of perceived coach support corresponding with heightened self&#x02010;confidence. Moreover, the study reinforces the importance of coach&#x02013;athlete relationship in regard to self&#x02010;confidence. A stronger connection between the coach and athlete is linked to enhanced self&#x02010;confidence, consistent with Gencer and &#x000d6;zt&#x000fc;rk&#x000a0;(<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In contrast to previous research (e.g., Freeman et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), received support did not predict self&#x02010;confidence, although our findings may be specific to types of support provided by coaches. The current findings are supported by previous research that has shown perceived support to be strongly related to similar variables such as self&#x02010;esteem (e.g., Lu et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Previous studies within sport psychology have failed to account fully for how social support relates to self&#x02010;confidence, specifically in relation to the role of coach support. Our research suggests that perceptions of coach support are more important than the support actually received in influencing self&#x02010;confidence. Although not tested in the current study, received coach support might aid self&#x02010;confidence via stress&#x02010;buffering effects (e.g., Rees &#x00026; Freeman,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>Sarason and Sarason&#x000a0;(<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) requested more research to explore the mechanisms of how social support works, with a particular need to test multiple psychological mechanisms simultaneously (Uchino et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In line with these previous recommendations, social support was examined as a potential mechanism underpinning key wellbeing and performance indicators. The current study found that perceived coach support and received coach support may exert contrasting effects. Specifically, coach&#x02013;athlete relationship was associated with a significant indirect effect on psychological wellbeing via received coach support but not perceived coach support. Therefore, when athletes feel they have a strong coach&#x02013;athlete relationship and receive support from their coach, psychological wellbeing is enhanced. In contrast, coach&#x02013;athlete relationship was associated with a significant indirect effect on self&#x02010;confidence via perceived coach support but not received coach support. Therefore, when athletes feel that they have a strong coach&#x02013;athlete relationship and perceive coach support to be available, self&#x02010;confidence is enhanced. Previous research has identified distinct mechanisms explaining how perceived support and received support may relate to health outcomes differently (Uchino,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This aligns with the current findings, which show opposing indirect effects of perceived coach support and received coach support on well&#x02010;being and self&#x02010;confidence.</p><p>The current study highlights the importance of social factors in sport, particularly the role of the coach. Although previous research has identified a relationship among social support with coach&#x02013;athlete relationship (Felton &#x00026; Jowett,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), self&#x02010;confidence (Freeman et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and positive wellbeing (Simons &#x00026; Bird,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>), the current study is the first to explore the relationship between these variables together. Furthermore, the current research examined the role of both perceived coach support and received coach support concurrently in relation to confidence and wellbeing. Studies mainly focus on one social support construct and therefore, are unable to detect the nuance effects of both perceived support and received support on outcome variables or identify potential mechanisms underpinning relationships between variables. The current study addresses recommendations for research to examine both support constructs (Freeman,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Simons and Bird&#x000a0;(<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>) found an association between coach&#x02013;athlete relationship and psychological wellbeing with perceived coach support but did not measure the potential impact of received coach support. The current research significantly enhances our comprehension of how social support positively influences wellbeing and confidence by identifying mediating effects, while also distinguishing how perceived coach support and received coach support function separately (DeFreese &#x00026; Smith,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>This study has important implications for how coaches can best offer support to their athletes and why such support is needed. Our findings highlight the positive influence perceived coach support and received coach support has in relation to a strong coach&#x02013;athlete relationship, with enhanced self&#x02010;confidence and psychological wellbeing. However, the effectiveness of social support&#x02010;based interventions has been mixed (e.g., Hogan et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). For example, one study found an intervention that centerd around an expert providing support to golfers led to feelings of enhanced received support of all three participants although performance only improved for one participant (Freeman et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Despite the challenges of developing effective support interventions, the current findings may provide an evidence&#x02010;based approach to effective coach support. We will discuss an approach to increase perceptions of available coach support and a recommendation for providing coach support.</p><p>In practical terms, enhancing perceptions of coach support along with developing a positive coach&#x02013;athlete relationship could lead to improved self&#x02010;confidence. Increasing perceptions of coach support may be considered relatively challenging to implement, as perceptions are based on generic evaluations of support providers and are considered relatively stable (Lakey,&#x000a0;<xref rid="ejsc12226-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). One potential strategy to improve perceptions of available support, and therefore, enhance self&#x02010;confidence, could be for coaches to have an open&#x02010;door policy to allow their athletes to speak to them if needed. This approach encourages coaches to cultivate a meaningful relationship with their athletes and shows commitment to supporting their needs. Additionally, by improving the receipt of actual support alongside developing a positive coach&#x02013;athlete relationship could help enhance psychological wellbeing. Coaches could cultivate greater awareness of their role as a support provider to advocate psychological well&#x02010;being and consciously support their athletes in times of need. Understanding individuals' support needs and how and when this support can be provided may take time but would be worthwhile to nurture a positive coach&#x02013;athlete relationship and psychological wellbeing. Furthermore, educating athletes as to the importance of perceived coach support and received coach support, and encouraging them to seek coach support, may have benefits for enhanced confidence and wellbeing.</p><p>Against the backdrop of the novelty of this study, there are some limitations. The current study is cross&#x02010;sectional in nature and examines only a single time point of athletes' ratings of their coach. Further research might consider a longitudinal approach to monitor coach support over a competitive season, as this could highlight any potential effects of performance results and whether these influence evaluations of coach support, coach&#x02013;athlete relationships, and psychological wellbeing. Therefore, tracking coach support for longer would provide a better understanding of the stable or transient nature of coach support. Moreover, although mediation analyses revealed perceived support and received support as potential mechanisms underpinning coach&#x02013;athlete relationship with self&#x02010;confidence and psychological wellbeing, this approach is unable to establish true cause and effect. Future studies might consider adopting an experimental design such as manipulating coach support and measuring subsequent effect on self&#x02010;confidence in relation to a performance task and psychological wellbeing.</p><p>To conclude, the findings from the current study demonstrate the distinct roles that perceived coach support and received coach support play in relation to the coach&#x02013;athlete relationship, self&#x02010;confidence, and psychological wellbeing. When analyzed concurrently, received coach support, but not perceived coach support, predicted psychological wellbeing, whereas only perceived coach support and the coach&#x02013;athlete relationship were significant predictors of self&#x02010;confidence, whereas received coach support was not. This suggests that the mechanisms in which perceived coach support and received coach support relate to wellbeing and self&#x02010;confidence operate differently. Such that, the coach&#x02013;athlete relationship is associated with a significant indirect effect on self&#x02010;confidence via perceived coach support. Whereas, the coach&#x02013;athlete relationship is associated with a significant indirect effect on psychological wellbeing via received coach support. Based on the results in this study, we have suggested practical recommendations for coaches to become more effective support providers by considering athletes' perceptions of support and the support received, which has implications for improving athletes' self&#x02010;confidence and psychological well&#x02010;being.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="ejsc12226-sec-0190"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec id="ejsc12226-sec-0180"><title>ETHICAL STATEMENT</title><p>The study was approved by the Newcastle University Ethical Committee (Ref: 13,142/2018).</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ejsc12226-sec-0160"><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>None.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="ejsc12226-sec-0210"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT</title><p>Any raw data are available upon request by contacting the corresponding author.</p></sec><ref-list content-type="cited-references" id="ejsc12226-bibl-0001"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ejsc12226-bib-0001"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="ejsc12226-cit-0001">
