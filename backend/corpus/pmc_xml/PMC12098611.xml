Previous research has indicated that acetylcholine (ACH) plays an anti-inflammatory role during inflammation by acting on the &#x003b1;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(&#x003b1;7nAchR) to promote the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors. However, the specific role of ACH in HAEC remains unclear. This experiment aims to explore the sources of ACH in HSCR and its anti-inflammatory mechanisms, thereby identifying new directions for the prevention and treatment of HAEC.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We analyzed single-cell transcriptome data from HSCR to identify cells that secrete ACH and observed their distribution using immunofluorescence. In <italic>Ednrb-/-</italic> mice, F4/80, iNOS, ARG-1 and CD206 were used to identify and locate M1 and M2 macrophages in different intestinal segments. Western blot, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to test the levels of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, interleukin-10, and the macrophage activation pathway proteins JAK2 and STAT3 in different intestinal segments of <italic>Ednrb-/-</italic> mice. Organoid and cell culture techniques were used to verify the anti-inflammatory mechanism of ACH <italic>in vitro</italic> models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>scRNA-seq analysis revealed that tuft cells expressed the CHAT protein. In HSCR, aganglionic segments exhibited heightened cholinergic activity compared with dilated ganglionic segments. In HAEC, inflammation was mainly concentrated in the dilated ganglionic segment and was associated with an increase in M1 macrophages, whereas the aganglionic segment showed less inflammation and was associated with an increase in M2 macrophages. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments showed that intestinal organoids containing tuft cells promoted an increase in M2 macrophage markers, and ACH promoted M2 macrophage polarization.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Differences in inflammation among various intestinal segments in HAEC may be linked to ACH secreted by tuft cells. Drugs targeting tuft cells have the potential to become important components of HAEC treatment in the future.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>tuft cells</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>Hirschsprung&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>

Abnormalities in the proliferation or apoptosis of colonic neural crest cells can contribute to the development of HSCR (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The most common and serious complication of HSCR is Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC), which is the major cause of mortality (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Previous studies have identified multiple factors contributing to the progression of HAEC, including alterations in the intestinal flora, abnormal immunity, and a breached intestinal barrier (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, these factors only partially elucidate the pathophysiological processes in HAEC.</p><p>Interactions between epithelial cells are essential for the function and immune defense of mucosal tissues (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and many substances, including acetylcholine (ACH), serve as bridges between them (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Although ACH is secreted by nerve cells (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), non-neuronal sources of ACH have also been reported (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Among the various types of epithelial cells, tuft cells are the primary source of ACH and play a key role in detecting harmful substances in the mucosal layer (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In the respiratory epithelium, tuft cells induce neuronal inflammation, ion transport in neighboring epithelial cells, and ciliary beat frequency via ACH secretion (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In the intestinal epithelia, ACH released by tuft cells can act on Paneth cells through paracellular pathways, triggering the release of antimicrobial peptides (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Although the interactions between tuft and epithelial cells play a significant role in resisting inflammatory invasion (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), immune cells in the lamina propria cannot be overlooked. Previous studies have shown that IL-25 secreted by tuft cells can act on type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in the lamina propria to resist helminth infections (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, the effects of ACH secreted by tuft cells on other immune cells have not yet been elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we focus on the elevation of ACHE in HSCR. By&#x000a0;analyzing scRNA-seq data from HSCR and utilizing immunofluorescence (IF) staining, we explore the reasons for the differences in ACH levels in the intestinal epithelium of HSCR patients. Furthermore, we delve into the anti-inflammatory effects of ACH, aiming to provide new methods for the treatment and prevention of HAEC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Patients and samples</title><p>Between August 2023 and December 2024, we collected eight colon samples with a pathological diagnosis of HSCR from Fujian Medical University Union Hospital (4 short-HSCR, 2 common-HSCR, 2 long-HSCR).

Sixteen adult female Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats were randomly assigned to two groups: an intervention group and a saline control group with eight rats each. The rats were fasted for 1 day prior to surgery to minimize intestinal contents and reduce the risk of aspiration during anesthesia. On the following day, they were anesthetized with 2% sodium pentobarbital administered via intraperitoneal injection (1.0 mL/400 g). Once the rats lost their muscular reflexes and were fully anesthetized, the abdominal cavity was opened. In the BZK group, filter paper soaked in 0.1% BZK solution was wrapped around the colon, whereas in the control group, filter paper soaked in saline was used. The filter paper was replaced every 5 min for a total of six changes. After the final change, the abdominal cavity was irrigated with saline solution and sterilized. Post-surgery, the rats received intraperitoneal injections of gentamicin sulfate (100 mg/kg body weight) prophylactically to prevent infections. After 2 weeks, the mice were euthanized using 2% pentobarbital sodium (0.4 mL/100 g); dilated and narrow intestinal segments were collected. The location of the ganglia was observed using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for calretinin. In the BZK-treated group, segments with ganglia were classified as dilated ganglionic segments, whereas those without ganglia were classified as BZK-treated segments. The control group was designated the healthy control.</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><label>2.4</label><title>Quality control and batch effects correction of scRNA-seq data</title><p>We analyzed HSCR single-cell data (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), which included eight aganglionic and five ganglionic intestinal segments from seven patients with HSCR (2 short-HSCR, 1 common-HSCR, 1 long-HSCR, and 3 total colonic aganglionosis), as well as 29 healthy segments from seven healthy donors.

We observed an abnormally hyperactive cholinergic system in the intestinal epithelium of aganglionic segments. Specifically, through IHC staining, we established that ACHE was abnormally elevated in the intestinal epithelium of the aganglionic segments. Subsequently, we verified that ACH levels were increased in the aganglionic segments of <italic>Ednrb-/-</italic> mice. Finally, by analyzing single-cell RNA data from patients with HSCR, we found that tuft cells were the only intestinal epithelial cells that had the ability to synthesize ACH. Additionally, compared to ganglionic dilated segments, the expression of tuft cell markers was higher in aganglionic segments by IF staining. Considering the established connections between tuft and immune cells in the lamina propria, we investigated whether there were interactions between other immune cells and tuft cells. Moreover, given that the role of macrophages in HAEC has been defined, we believe that a relationship exists between ACH secreted by tuft cells and macrophages. By co-culturing organoids containing tuft cells with three different macrophage lines, we observed an increased expression of M2 macrophage markers, particularly in RAW264.7. This finding is consistent with the phenomenon of elevated M2 macrophage marker expression in the aganglionic intestinal segments. Furthermore, we found that the expression of &#x003b1;7nAchR receptors was significantly increased in the aganglionic intestinal segments of <italic>Ednrb-/-</italic> mice and that these receptors co-localized with macrophages. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments revealed that ACH and &#x003b1;7nAchR agonists promoted the phenotypic switch of macrophages from M1 to M2. Collectively, these results indicate that in HAEC, ACH in the intestinal epithelium of aganglionic segments is mainly expressed by tuft cells. Tuft cells transmit harmful information from the intestinal lumen to macrophages in the lamina propria by secreting ACH, promoting the M2 polarization of macrophages and thus exerting an anti-inflammatory effect in aganglionic segments.</p><p>Pathological examination for ACHE, which indicates the presence of an abnormally hyperactive cholinergic system (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), was traditionally established as the gold standard for the diagnosis of HSCR (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). We confirmed this using IHC staining in patients with HSCR, <italic>Ednrb-/-</italic> mice, and BZK-treated rats. Additionally, ELISA experiments performed on <italic>Ednrb-/-</italic> mice revealed a significant increase in ACH expression in the aganglionic segments. Previous studies have demonstrated that RET mutations in HSCR can lead to an increase in CHAT expression in the intestine (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), which partially explains the high expression of ACHE in aganglionic segments. Our findings also revealed a hyperactive cholinergic system in the intestinal epithelial layer. Through analysis of single-cell RNA data from patients with HSCR, we found that tuft cells in the intestinal epithelium were the only cells that could synthesize ACH. Therefore, we believe that ACH of epithelial origin is mainly secreted by tuft cells.</p><p>Notably, the BZK rat model has recently emerged as a viable animal model for HSCR (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Studies have demonstrated elevated ACHE expression in BZK-treated intestinal segments, consistent with the pathological features of HSCR (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Therefore, the BZK-treated rat model was incorporated into our study as one of the HSCR models. To confirm the success of the BZK rats model, we performed calretinin IHC staining on BZK-treated intestinal segments to check for ganglion cell. Calretinin, a calcium-binding protein, is widely present in the ganglion cells and nerve fibers of the ENS and serves as a neuronal marker (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In normal intestinal segments, Calretinin exhibits normal staining of ganglion cells and nerve fibers. However, in the aganglionic segment of the bowel affected by HSCR, ganglion cells are absent (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In this study, the intestinal segments treated with BZK exhibited an absence of ganglion cells, while the distal colon of <italic>Ednrb-/-</italic> mice also displayed aganglionosis. These findings indicated that both models have the same pathological state with HSCR.</p><p>Tuft cells are classified as intestinal epithelial secretory cells and are significant members of the intestinal epithelial immune system (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). They are equipped with a series of key components for taste signal transduction, including transient receptor potential melastatin 5 (TRPM5), gustducin, and phospholipase &#x003b2;2 (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). These components play central roles in the response of tuft cells to intestinal microbial infections. Therefore, tuft cells represent another major type of intestinal epithelial cell with immune function, alongside goblet cells and Paneth cells (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Recently, it was found that CHAT, which synthesizes ACH, is expressed in tuft cells of both mice and humans (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Consequently, tuft cells are regarded as the only epithelial cell type that could synthesize ACH (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Tuft cells have been detected in patients with HSCR, and compared to ganglionic intestinal segments, the tuft cell marker gene, DCLK1, has been shown to have increased expression in aganglionic segments. This finding aligns with the results of tuft cell IF staining observed in our experiment.</p><p>Macrophages play a crucial role in inflammatory progression by polarizing into different types (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). The role of macrophages in HAEC has been well-established; they drive the occurrence of HAEC by promoting polarization towards the M1 phenotype in the dilated segment (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). In our study, we observed an increasing number of M1 macrophages in the ganglionic dilated segment, whereas M2 macrophages were predominant in the aganglionic segment of <italic>Ednrb-/-</italic> mice. Simultaneously, we also observed that the expression of inflammatory factors was predominantly concentrated in the ganglionic dilated segment, with a corresponding decrease in the aganglionic segment. Additionally, we also found that a large number of immune cell infiltrations and crypt abscesses were present in the intestinal epithelium of the ganglionic dilated segment. Therefore, we believe that the inflammation associated with HAEC was mainly concentrated in the dilated ganglionic segment, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Notably, under normal conditions, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; binds to NF-&#x003ba;B and prevents its entry into the nucleus, maintaining NF-&#x003ba;B in an inactive state. When cells receive external stimuli, the IKK complex gets activated and subsequently phosphorylates I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; at serine residues 32 and 36 (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Following I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation, the released NF-&#x003ba;B translocates into the nucleus where it binds to the promoter regions of various inflammation-related genes (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we performed protein detection of phosphorylated I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and revealed that the phosphorylated I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; expression level was significantly increased in ganglionic dilated intestinal segments.</p><p>Studies on tuft cells have primarily focused on their ability to resist helminth infection by promoting the proliferation of ILC2 in the lamina propria mucosa (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). However, in our experiments, IL-13 treatment led to increased tuft cell numbers within the intestinal organoids and upregulated CHAT, co-culturing organoids containing tuft cells with three different macrophage lines resulted in increased expression of M2 macrophage markers, indicating that tuft cells can affect other immune cells. We also observed an increase in IL-10 expression, which was an anti-inflammatory cytokine that could counteract the production of pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-12/23 p40, IL-6 and TNF by macrophages (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), indicating that organoids containing tuft cells could promote M2 macrophage polarization and exert anti - inflammatory effects. IF staining revealed that they were in close proximity to macrophages in <italic>Ednrb-/-</italic> mice. Moreover, the ACH receptor &#x003b1;7nAchR was highly expressed in <italic>Ednrb-/-</italic> mice and co-localized with macrophages. We believe that the tuft cells could promote the polarization of M2 macrophages in the aganglionic segment. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> revealed that ACH increased the expression of M2 macrophage markers, It also promoted the expression of IL-10 gene. ACH activated the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in macrophages, promoting their polarization towards the M2 phenotype, which was consistent with the observations made in the aganglionic segments of <italic>Ednrb-/-</italic> mice.</p><p>Concerning the main strengths of this study, we explored the reasons for cholinergic activation in the epithelium of the aganglionic segment and unraveled an acetylcholine-related anti-inflammatory mechanism. However, this study also comprises several limitations. First, we have not explored the acetylcholine synthesis process in tuft cells. Yet, we discovered that IL-13 stimulation boosts acetylcholine synthesis-related CHAT protein expression in organoids. In the future, we will delve deeper into analyzing the acetylcholine synthesis mechanism in tuft cells. Second, though postoperative HAEC exhibits certain incidence after surgery, no such cases occurred in our collected samples. Therefore, our study does not involve postoperative HAEC research. Finally, the organoid experiments in this study were based on normal C57 mice to extrapolate the physiological changes in the intestines of <italic>Ednrb-/-</italic> mice. Given the complexity of the intestinal conditions in <italic>Ednrb-/-</italic> mice, further research is necessary. In the future, we will also focus on developing HSCR-derived intestinal organoids and further elucidating the mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of HAEC.</p><p>In summary, our findings revealed that in HAEC, the hyperactive cholinergic system in the aganglionic segments was associated with increased ACH secretion, which occurred not only in the muscular layer but also in the epithelial layer. Additionally, tuft cells were the only cells in the epithelial layer capable of synthesizing ACH. Therefore, we believe that the elevation of ACH in the epithelial layer of the aganglionic segments is related to the tuft cells. Examination of inflammation in different intestinal segments of HAEC revealed that inflammation in HAEC was predominantly concentrated in the mucosal layer of dilated ganglionic segments. This difference was associated with a reduction in ACH secretion from tuft cells. This reduction potentially hindered the polarization of macrophages into the M2 phenotype. Consequently, it may have contributed to inflammation accumulation and the development of HAEC. Targeting tuft cells to regulate the levels of ACH within the epithelial layer and influence macrophage polarization may become a primary choice for the treatment of HAEC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors gratefully thank Zhihong Huang from the Public Technology Service Center (Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China) for technical assistance.
