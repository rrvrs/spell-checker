A relatively recent alternative to these &#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; bathing options are natural swimming ponds, which are fresh water pools where the water is purified solely through natural way. These ponds present also valuable opportunity for research on the impact of anthropogenic pollution, as they are relatively small areas with a high concentration of visitors, with bathers often being the main source of contamination. Among the various potential infections, those caused by bacteria of the genus <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, mainly <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> species are of significant concern. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is an opportunistic pathogenic Gram-negative aerobic rod belonging to the Pseudomonadaceae family, typically isolated from aquatic environments. Its increased occurrence in swimming pools, bathing waters, urban water features (e.g., interactive fountains), and swimming ponds may be associated with an increased risk of mucosal inflammation (e.g., external ear canal conjunctivitis, nasal canal mucosa, abrasions, and other open skin injuries) or urinary infections in more susceptible individuals (Seyfries and Cook <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1984</xref>; van Asperen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1995</xref>). <italic>P. otitidis</italic>, a related species described in 2006, has been isolated from clinical material (Clark et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>) and is primarily associated with ear infections, though cases of non-otitis infections have also been reported (Caixintha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2021</xref>). Further work has shown that this species can also cause skin infections. Despite their close relationship, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>otitidis</italic> can be well distinguished by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization&#x02013;time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). However, it is likely that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>otitidis</italic> infections have been underestimated, as they may have been misidentified as <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> (Caixintha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2021</xref>). To date, the occurrence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>otitidis</italic> species in environmental samples and also in bathing waters (including bathing ponds) has been rarely studied. In addition to being opportunistic pathogenic, both species have been described to have antibiotic resistance (including multidrug resistance), particularly to carbapenems (Milligan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2023</xref>; Thaller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>; Kol&#x000e1;&#x00159; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>; Logan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2017</xref>). The original aim of this short communication was to optimize a method for the determination of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in anthropogenically influenced bathing waters (samples with high levels of background microflora) and to assess the level of contamination of bathing ponds with this opportunistic pathogen. However, as we began isolating another opportunistic pathogen, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>otitidis</italic>, in addition to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>, we shifted our focus to include also this species. In addition to quantifying both opportunistic pathogenic pseudomonades, we evaluated biochemical characteristics, which are used in the confirmation of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>, if they would be useful also for the confirmation of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>otitidis</italic>. We also assessed the susceptibility of isolated strains to selected antibiotics and determined the presence of the Exotoxin A gene (<italic>exoA</italic>), which is associated with pathogenicity and may help to distinguish between virulent and non-virulent strains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sampling</title><p id="Par3">Water samples were collected during the summer of 2023 (from June to September) from four locations of bathing ponds in Prague and Central Bohemia, two of which were sampled repeatedly.

Grab samples were collected, always 1&#x02013;2 samples per site, depending on the area. To capture additional strains for studying ATB resistance and the <italic>exoA</italic> gene, samples were also collected from three urban water fountains. A total of 23 water samples were collected and analyzed.

We were able to repeatedly isolate the opportunistic pathogenic species, <italic>P. otitidis</italic>, which is rarely detected in environmental samples and may cause health problems in such heavily frequented sites. Elevated numbers (15&#x02013;80&#x000a0;CFU/100&#x000a0;mL) of <italic>P. otitidis</italic> were also detected in 6 samples from the sites C and D, collected during the second part of the summer season after large crowds visited the bathing ponds, reaching their upper capacity limits. <italic>P. otitidis</italic> has also been detected in geothermal bathing pools in Iceland (Thorolfsdottir and Marteinsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>).

Moreover, direct detection of pseudomonades by PCR methods from the environment with a high background microflora is challenging due to the relatively low abundance of the target group compared to the total bacterial population.

In addition to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>P. otitidis</italic>, which was primarily isolated from clinical material as an ear pathogen, was also detected. This bacterium exhibited a negative acetamide test and showed weak hydrolysis of the 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin aminopeptidase substrate, meaning it cannot be detected by standard method for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> according to EN ISO 16266. <italic>P. otitidis</italic> was detected in higher concentrations during the second half of the swimming season, particularly after large crowds visited the swimming ponds, reaching their upper capacity limit. Its presence can account for infection, especially in immunocompromised individuals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12223_2024_1229_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 78 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>During the revision of this manuscript, the authors used the chatGPT to improve the overall quality of the English language and phrases.</p></ack><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>Open access publishing supported by the institutions participating in the CzechELib Transformative Agreement.
