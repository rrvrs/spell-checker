</self-uri><abstract><p>Contaminated household water in peri-urban communities is a reservoir for virulent <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic>, but its role in the environmental transmission of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) remains poorly understood. This study characterized <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> from household water and additionally aimed to investigate the transmissibility of ARGs from drug-resistant isolates. Twenty-five <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> isolates from thirteen household well water sources were tested for resistance to 14 antibiotics by disc diffusion and whole-genome sequenced using the Illumina platform. The ARGs and plasmid replicon types were respectively predicted using ResFinder and PlasmidFinder. Multidrug-resistant strains carrying plasmid replicons found in unrelated strains were conjugated with nalidixic acid-resistant (NAL<sup>R</sup>) <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> C<sub>600</sub> using the solid plate method. Fifteen isolates displayed a multi-drug resistance (MDR) phenotype, with 18 possessing ARGs that confer resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, macrolide, sulphonamide, aminoglycoside, chloramphenicol, &#x003b2;-lactams, and tetracycline. Fifteen of the 25 isolates belonged to sequence type detected more than once, and fourteen of these were multidrug resistant. Through solid plate mating, beta-lactam-resistant <italic toggle="yes">qnrS1-tet-dfrA14-</italic>positive strains bearing IncFI-, IncHI2, and IncHI2A successfully transferred ampicillin resistance to a nalidixic acid-resistant derivative of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>-<sub>C600</sub>. This research highlights the urgent need to safeguard household water sources against fecal contamination to curb the dissemination of ARGs among bacterial populations in this environment.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

In 2019, 4.95 million individuals were estimated to have died globally due to drug-resistant bacterial infections [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. AMR surveillance gives greater attention to human clinical isolates and less is known about transmission within and across other One Health sectors (animals and environment). This biased interest misses the opportunity to understand and interrupt the transmission of resistant organisms and/or resistance genes outside the clinic, especially in low- and middle-income (LMIC) countries [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Household water used for drinking and domestic purposes, particularly in informal urban settlements, is an under-surveilled niche with the potential to impact human health [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Examining the role of contaminated water in the environmental transmission of AMR could assist in estimating the degree to which this niche contributes to AMR in settings where good quality water is difficult to access and AMR data are scarce [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Moreover, the risk associated with contaminated drinking water as a medium for spreading resistance genes globally is yet to be investigated in detail [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recent model estimates that improvements in Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) could reduce AMR-related deaths by 247,800 [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the estimates did not include the possibility of non-pathogens in water serving as a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance genes because of a dearth of evidence.</p><p>In Nigeria, waterborne diseases are common due to an inadequate supply of clean water, poor sanitation, and, in some cases, the consumption of contaminated household water [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Alternate water sources to deficient public municipal water infrastructure [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], such as wells and boreholes, particularly when unprotected, used by householders are prone to faecal contamination. Recent research has shown that these sources harbour virulent <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and other enteric pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Still, little is known about the contribution of unprotected household water to the bacterial resistance reservoir and the potential of organisms in it to horizontally transfer antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs).</p><p>In southwestern Nigeria, one of the leading antimicrobial-resistant bacterial species found in clinical settings and recovered from contaminated household water is <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Reports demonstrate that extended-spectrum-lactamase (ESBLs) and certain <italic toggle="yes">dfrA</italic> alleles are highly prevalent in African studies, including Nigeria [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We have recently reported proximal wells of different households can contain genetically indistinguishable strains such that household water is a vehicle for the clonal expansion of resistant bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We theorize that bacteria in households carrying mobile elements may transmit them to other bacteria, particularly in our setting. Therefore, this study was designed to determine whether <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> isolates recovered from contaminated household water are multidrug-resistant and can disseminate the ARGs they carry. We performed antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) and whole genome sequencing of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> isolates, inspected the sequences of the strains for ARGs and plasmid replicons, and conjugated them with a plasmid-free <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> strain to explore the transfer of resistance phenotype and genotype.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area</title><p>The study area is north-east Ibadan in the south-western Nigeria. The sampling sites, Akinyele and Lagelu LGAs, were selected based on their obvious limited or non-connectivity to Ibadan piped water. These two regions each have been re-demarcated into three municipal districts due to urban renewal: Akinyele East LCDA (AELCDA), Akinyele South LCDA (ASLCDA), Akinyele LGA (ALGA), Lagelu West LCDA (LWLCDA), Lagelu North LCDA (LNLCDA) and Lagelu LGA (LLGA). In urban part of Ibadan metropolis, low water safety and its microbiological quality [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] could have accounted for the incidence of enteric fever and diarrheal disease [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, very little information is available from the peri-urban areas, especially in Akinyele and Lagelu local government areas (LGAs) which are either not covered by the public water distribution network or where residents do not enjoy regular municipal water supply thus warranting a longitudinal and laboratory-based investigation of the water sources for clearer picture [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Strain isolation and identification</title><p>In periurban Ibadan, we had reported longitudinal collection of three samples each from 96 household (well&#x02009;=&#x02009;66 and borehole&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) water sources which covered a wet and two dry seasons from January 2019 to March 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] using Raosoft [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] software as the sample size estimator.

Improvements in Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene can potentially impact the transmission of antimicrobial resistance and enteric infections. This study unveils that without preventing fecal contamination of drinking water, the spread of fecally derived bacteria can support the horizontal spread of ARGs in household water by clonal expansion of resistant strains and transmission of mobile genetic elements. The small number of isolates examined limited a wider generalisation of the import of the study. Thus, further studies are suggested to determine whether household drinking water can lead to the human acquisition of environmentally disseminated ARGs. This would help to evaluate the extent of the threat to public health posed by consuming drinking water contaminated with bacteria carrying transmissible genes. In the interim, sensitising the householders on the use of ceramic and biosand water filters [<xref rid="pone.0318969.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] is recommended to forestall the spread of microbes carrying mobile and transmissible resistance traits.</p></sec><sec id="sec018" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0318969.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><p>Information on the isolates&#x02019; bioproject, sample, and sequence read archive accession.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0318969.s001.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>None</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0318969.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>CJL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ikuta</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sharara</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Swetschinski</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Robles Aguilar</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>. <article-title>Global burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance in 2019: a systematic analysis</article-title>. <source>The Lancet</source>. <year>2022</year>;<volume>399</volume>(<issue>10325</issue>):<fpage>629</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>55</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/s0140-6736(21)02724-0</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0318969.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Nadimpalli</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Montealegre</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gilman</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pajuelo</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Saito</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>. <article-title>Urban informal settlements as hotspots of antimicrobial resistance and the need to curb environmental transmission</article-title>. <source>Nat Microbiol</source>. <year>2020</year>;<volume>5</volume>(<issue>6</issue>):<fpage>787</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>95</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1038/s41564-020-0722-0</pub-id>

The number of households samples would be good to reflect. It's possible this may have been described in the previous publication but this manuscript is a stand alone so you may need to provide a synopsis of key points in the methods.</p><p>Line 63</p><p>Do you mean to say "municipal areas"?</p><p>Line 190 &#x00026;191</p><p>How many household were sampled in total? This is especially for someone who has not and may not be going back to read your previous publication.</p><p>Lines 279-286</p><p>Are there studies that have reported similar or different findings in well, borehole and/or water from other open sources? It will be helpful to discuss these findings in reference to such findings. If there are such findings then, you may not need to bother. It is good to talk about the implication of these findings but who else is talkin about them? This gives a fair idea of what other researchers are saying about this problem.</p><p>Line 318-319</p><p>Just wondering if there are studies that have reported such similarities in water sources within similar distances apart.</p><p>Line 339-340</p><p>Has there been reports that water obtained from these wells and wells around the study are is consumed without treatment? Have there been studies that show water treatment could reduce this risks? Since this water sources are largely private, would you suggest sensitization on water treatment, if this is an effective control measure?</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;I commend the authors for conducting a well-designed and timely study on the transmissible antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli from household drinking water. It is my opinion that the integration of WGS and conjugation experiments adds significant value to the understanding of ARG dissemination in environmental reservoirs in Ibadan. The study addresses an important public health concern and contributes valuable insights into the potential risks posed by multidrug-resistant E. coli in drinking water sources especially in the study area. The methodology is well-detailed, and the findings are clearly presented. I particularly appreciate the discussion&#x02019;s emphasis on public health implications and the need for water treatment before consumption in those areas. Below, I provide some comments and suggestions that may help further strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>ABSTRACT</p><p>Page 1 Line 16: Do you mean 25 E.coli ISOLATES? Please write this correctly</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>Lines 53 - 54: It seems you are referring to a previous study that you conducted here. Please provide the citation and reference for this report or study.</p><p>METHODS</p><p>Lines 62-65: since the readers may not necesarily have access to your previous study, i suggest you provide more information concerning how this data was collected. Also, this concerning data collected in different locations can also be better presented on a map. Were the sampling sites chosen systematically or based on convenience?</p><p>what is the justification for the number of samples collected?</p><p>Is there a reason why different number of samples were collected at different locations? What was the reason for selecting these differnt locations? was this based on prior contamination reports, random selection or simply because of accessibility? You see why it is important to provide more context about the data?</p><p>Line 80: Can you confirm if multiple replicates were performed to ensure reliability?</p><p>Line 88: How were sequencing errors or assembly artifacts handled? Was this discussed in the previous study? It would be interesting to know.</p><p>Lines 110 - 118: What was the rationale for using solid media for conjugation instead of liquid mating? Also, it is not clear from this description if you included appropriate controls. How did you rule out spontaneous mutations or contamination? This is not clear in your description here. Was a known conjugative strain used as a positive control? just to understand how the conjugation system was validated</p><p>RESULTS</p><p>Line 135: 100% is not a majority but its the total. Its better to say "All were resistant to erythromycin"</p><p>Line 149-150: This explanation should be left for the discussion section</p><p>DISCUSSION</p><p>Lines 285 - 286: What is the public health implication of this finding? This will be a good place to include the implications here.</p><p>Lines 296-298: It is important to state the public health implications of this finding. Also how does this finding compare to studies from other regions with similar water quality challenges?</p><p>Lines 338 - 340: What are the strengths of your study? It is important to highlight them here in the discussion.</p><p>You have quite profound results, what limitations might affect the interpretation of these results? Could other factors (e.g.Small sample size, biofilm formation, water treatment practices e.t.c) influence the findings? It is important to consider external factors affecting AMR persistence in water systems.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;I have thoroughly reviewed the manuscript and found no errors or areas that require revision.

</p><p>Response to Review for Manuscript number: PONE-D-25-04412</p><p>Title: Transmissible antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli isolated from household drinking water in Ibadan, Nigeria</p><p>Akeem G. Rabiu, Olutayo I. Falodun, Rotimi A. Dada, Ayorinde O. Afolayan, Olabisi C. Akinlabi, Elizabeth T. Akande and Iruka N. Okeke</p><p>Response to the editor</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity of peer review and the invitation to prepare a revision. We have responded to and addressed all the reviewers&#x02019; comments. The editor was particularly interested in seeing that the following concerns were addressed</p><p>1. The editor wants our manuscript to meet PLOS ONE's style requirements. We respond that we have carefully perused the PLOS ONE&#x02019;s style requirements and complied with the rules accordingly.</p><p>2. The editor noted our financial disclosure and wanted a declaration of the role of the funder. We amend the financial disclosure as follows: This work was supported by the African Research Leader&#x02019;s Award MR/L00464X/1 to INO which was jointly funded by the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC) and the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) under the MRC/DFID Concordat agreement and is also part of the EDCTP2 program supported by the European Union. INO is a Calestous Juma Fellow supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Grant no. INV-036234). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. This has been inserted in the cover letter as advised by the editor.</p><p>3. We regret that our study funding information was not appropriately inserted in the online Funding Statement. In the meantime, we have deleted the financial disclosure statement from the Acknowledgement section as advised by the editor. We provide a revised the funding information here that &#x02018;This work was supported by an African Research Leader&#x02019;s Award to INO, which was jointly funded by the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC) and the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) under the MRC/DFID Concordat agreement and is also part of the EDCTP2 program supported by the European Union. INO is a Calestous Juma Fellow supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Grant no. INV-036234). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.&#x02019; This has also been included in the cover letter. The editor is here appreciated for the promise to help reflect the amended funding information in the online Funding Statement.</p><p>4. The editor wants the corresponding author to include and validate his ORCiD. We respond that all the authors, including the corresponding have their ORCiD appropriately linked on the manuscript.</p><p>5. The editor wants us to review the references and ensure that it is complete and correct and that any retracted papers listed as references are removed. We write that the references are complete and correct, and none of the references has been retracted.</p><p>Response to the additional editorial comments</p><p>6. The editor wants us to state the key limitation of the study and merge the last paragraph of the discussion section with the conclusion while ensuring that the conclusion appears first. In the revised manuscript, we stated a key study limitation in line 357 that: The small number of isolates examined limited wider generalisation of the import of the study. We have also merged the future directions or recommendations with conclusion but we ensured the initial concluding remarks first appeared as advised by the editor (lines 350-362).</p><p>7. The editor observed that 50% of our study&#x02019;s citations were older than five years, whereas no more than 20% of references are permitted from older sources unless they are foundational studies. We answer that the references have been updated by replacing 11 old references with more recent literature within the past five years and that the older references were limited to key foundational studies.</p><p>8. The editor wants us to use the PACE platform to improve the image quality of our figures. We respond that the figures have been improved and converted to .tif using PACE.</p><p>Response to reviewer #1</p><p>1. We appreciate reviewer #1 for the time spent reviewing the manuscript. Reviewer #1 wants us to add &#x02018;good&#x02019; in line 40 to &#x02018;quality water&#x02019; so it reads &#x02018;good quality water&#x02019;. This has been done.</p><p>2. The reviewer wants us to add &#x02018;antimicrobial&#x02019; to &#x02018;resistance genes&#x02019; to read &#x02018;antimicrobial resistance genes.&#x02019; This has been done in line 44</p><p>3. The reviewer wants us to include a reference at the end of the statement. We have inserted the reference in lines 55-56.</p><p>4. The reviewer wants us to state the number of isolates including additional study context. We answer that 25 E. coli isolates were retrieved from 13 households, and this has been inserted in line 76. We provided additional study context under study area subsection in lines 63-72 and further details in lines 74-76.</p><p>5. The correction noted by the reviewer has been effected as the phrase now reads &#x02018;municipal areas.&#x02019;</p><p>6. We appreciate the comment of the reviewer concerning additional information on sampling framework. We have supplied more information on sampling context in lines 63-72 and lines 74-76 under the methodology section.</p><p>7. The reviewer is appreciated for his/her comments on the implications of our study and for the wishes to amplify this further in the discussion section. We have provided specific resistance genes found in common with other studies in the revised manuscript. We further clarified in the text that these antimicrobial resistance genes are capable of thwarting treatment of infections caused by these strains, especially when first-line antimicrobials are administered, in lines 299-301.</p><p>8. The reviewer wondered if there are studies that have reported such similarities in water sources within similar distances apart. We responded that several studies have reported fecal contamination of drinking water in Nigeria1,2 but the current study actually took a step further to have performed the finest resolution of E. coli using whole genome sequencing.</p><p>9. The reviewer wants to know if previous reports have shown that water obtained from the wells and wells around the study area are being consumed without treatment and whether treating the water could reduce the risks involved. The reviewer also sought to know whether sensitization on water treatment could effectively reduce the risk associated with the source water contamination since these water sources are largely private. We respond that treatment of drinking water at household level is poorly practised in Nigeria3. However, we agree with the reviewer that household&#x02019;s sensitisation on treating drinking water, using low-cost point-of-use option4, can be an effective control measure. We have therefore revised this manuscript to reflect this understanding as follows: In the interim, sensitising the householders on the use of ceramic and biosand water filters [35] is recommended to forestall the spread of microbes carrying mobile and transmissible resistance traits.</p><p>Response to reviewer #2</p><p>1. We are delighted that the reviewer found our narrative interesting and compressive. We thank the reviewer for this supportive comment and appreciate him for his kind and generous comments, and for the time spent in reviewing the article. We provide below point by point responses to his observations/suggestions. Indeed, we agree that attending to the comments of the reviewer have helped to improve the quality of the manuscript&#x02019;s narrative.</p><p>2. The reviewer wants us to insert the word &#x02018;isolates&#x02019; immediately after E. coli. This has been done (Line 17).</p><p>3. The reviewer wants us to provide the citation and reference for our previous study. We respond that the previous work has been inserted at the end of the sentence in the revised manuscript5 (Lines 55-56).</p><p>4. The reviewer wants us to provide additional context on the study area, sample size and collection, and to use map to show where the data were obtained. We appreciate the comments of the reviewer and have inserted study area sub-section under materials and methods to give clear context for the study justification and the sampling framework (lines 63-72, 74-76).</p><p>5. The reviewer wants to know if multiple replicates were performed to ensure reliability. We confirm that the samples were analysed in triplicates and that each water sample was collected three times - in a wet season and two dry seasons. We have made this clear in several lines 63-72, 74-76 and 89.</p><p>6. The reviewer wants to know how sequencing errors and read artifacts were handled. We respond, in line 104 that: After genome sequencing, sequence reads were demultiplexed and adapters removed and in lines 106-107 that: with contigs &#x0003c;200 bp and coverage &#x0003c;10-fold excluded from the analyses.</p><p>7. The reviewer wants to know the rationale for using solid media for conjugation instead of liquid mating and that clarity should be provided on how the controls were handled and the conjugation experiments validated, including how spontaneous mutations or contamination were ruled out. We used solid plate method because it provides high cell density and proximity between donor and recipient cells enabling mating pair formation without the need for mating pair stabilisation which is important for liquid mating method6. As for the control experiment, we indicated in Table 2 of the manuscript that E. coli ATCC 25922 was the control strain. In the revised text, we restated that: Transconjugant colonies consistent with the parent organisms were taken further (lines 136-137) and that: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used as the control strain (line 139).</p><p>8. &#x02018;All were resistant to erythromycin&#x02019; has been inserted. (line 147).</p><p>9. The reviewer prefers that the narration &#x02018;No isolate carried aac-6-lb-cr, which confers ciprofloxacin and aminoglycoside resistance (Fig. 1). Although no carbapenemase genes were detected, nor was resistance to carbapenems, one multidrug-resistant strain carrying mobile colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was found&#x02019; should be part of discussion. We appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s comments and assure that we have provided a context in the discussion section to reflect the import of the findings but consider that the two statements be permitted as a pretext for a broader view outlined in the discussion. (lines 160-162)</p><p>10. The reviewer wants us to state the public health implication of our study. In the revised manuscript, we respond that: It is worrying that these antimicrobial resistance genes are capable of thwarting treatment of infections caused by these strains, especially when first-line antimicrobials are administered. (lines 299-301)</p><p>11. The reviewer remarked the importance of stating the public health implications of PMQR and how it compare to studies from other regions with similar water quality challenges. Although we both did not observe quinolones resistance phenotype and QRDR mutations in the strains carrying qnrS1 genes, we, however, explained that the transfer of the PMQR genes can cause clinically significant quinolone resistance in a recipient strain that has them [12]. We have inserted a reference to show how this scenario pans out in the setting (line 311).</p><p>12. The reviewer wants us to state the strengths of our study. We thank the reviewer for this comment and answer that our &#x02018;study unveils that without preventing fecal contamination of drinking water, the spread of fecally derived bacteria can support the horizontal spread of ARGs in household water by clonal expansion of resistant strains and transmission of mobile genetic elements&#x02019; (lines 354-357).</p><p>13. The thank the reviewer for acknowledging that our results are profound. We respond to queries on study limitations as follows: A few isolates examined in this study limited a wider generalisation of the import of the study. Thus, further studies are suggested to determine whether household drinking water can lead to the human acquisition of environmentally disseminated ARGs. This would help to evaluate the extent of the threat to public health posed by consuming drinking water contaminated with bacteria carrying transmissible genes (lines 357-362). We agree with the reviewer that water treatment practices can improve the microbiological quality of the water sources. We therefore suggested, in the revised manuscript, that: sensitising the householders on the use of ceramic and biosand water filters [35] is recommended to forestall the spread of microbes carrying mobile and transmissible resistance traits. (lines 361-362)</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the time spent in reading the manuscript and the generous kind words and comments on the quality of our work.</p><p>References cited in this response to the reviewers</p><p>1.
