Introduction</title><p>The railway sensors are facing unprecedented challenges in protecting digital actuators and physical infrastructure from cyber threats. With the increasing reliance on digital technology, railways are becoming more vulnerable to a wide range of cyber threats. Cybersecurity of railway sensors includes physical security measures, network security systems, and information security protocols. Rail systems have evolved considerably since their inception, especially in the last decade, which has seen the rise of cybersecurity as a critical component of rail infrastructure and rolling stock. Physical cybersecurity must be handled with extreme vigilance [<xref rid="B1-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Increasing digitalization makes the system more intelligent and allows consumers to better benefit from innovative services. At the same time, digitization also makes sensors more critical that creates significant risks [<xref rid="B2-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], as increased exposure to cyber-attacks and cybersecurity incidents potentially puts the security and privacy of sensors data at serious vulnerabilities. Thus, it is important to increase cybersecurity in railways and its impact on the physical actuators by:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Preventive Techniques: Implement multiple cybersecurity measures to prevent attacks;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Risk Assessment: Know the potential risks and assess them regularly;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cybersecurity Culture: Develop a culture of cybersecurity awareness throughout the organization.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Digital innovation has already delivered major breakthroughs in efficiency, comfort, and safety across the rail sensors [<xref rid="B1-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As technologies modernize, their exposure to cyber risks increases [<xref rid="B3-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The rail industry prioritize cybersecurity to effectively manage security and safety threats of trackside sensors, to on-board actuator networks. As hackers use malware, viruses, and social engineering to attack rail systems, operators innovate to stay ahead of these challenges. While rail assets are designed to last for decades, cyber threats are constantly evolving before a project even begins, manufacturers must plan to rethink a product&#x02019;s architecture approximately every five years to ensure adequate protection throughout its 30-year lifespan. If anticipation is the key to effective cybersecurity, companies must know how and what to anticipate to make the rail sensors more resilient to cyberattacks. Manufacturers must work with other transportation operators and external experts to create an open environment for discussing common threats. Railway sensors are complex and interconnected, requiring a robust security approach to protect critical actuators and prevent potential threats such as terrorism, cyber-attacks, and natural disasters. The implementation of the Secure-by-Design approach in railway systems involves several steps, including:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Identify threats, vulnerabilities, and risks for each on-board sensor;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Design security controls and architecture of each actuator;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Implement and test security controls;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Maintain and update the security system.</p></list-item></list></p><p>This paper is in line with some research topics related to cybersecurity and railway, with specific objectives to answer some research questions, like:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>How can we define an appropriate classification of cybersecurity issues and problems of rail physical infrastructure?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What are the adopted mechanisms for current risk management?</p></list-item></list></p><p>Current approaches are often insufficient to address the specific challenges of integrating modern and legacy rail systems, particularly through the development of standards such as IEC 62443 [<xref rid="B4-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Current studies and protocols typically focus on isolated railway infrastructure components and neglect a holistic approach that combines cyber and operational security. In addition, especially in environments where legacy systems are interconnected with new technologies, many frameworks lack the adaptability to address emerging threats from advanced persistent threats (APTs), creating security blind spots. A major limitation remains the lack of a comprehensive, real-time cybersecurity framework tailored to the specific needs of railway systems.</p><p>Research Gap: Although considerable advances have been made in confronting the cybersecurity issues associated with railways, significant shortcomings persist in the effective integration of both contemporary and legacy systems. The current approach, as exemplified by the standards set forth in IEC 62443 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, frequently focuses on discrete infrastructure elements without integrating a unified strategy that encompasses both cyber and operational security. Furthermore, a considerable number of frameworks are deficient in their capacity to adapt effectively to emerging threats, such as advanced persistent threats (APTs), particularly in environments where legacy systems are present alongside novel technologies. There is a pressing necessity for the creation of a comprehensive, real-time cybersecurity framework that is specifically tailored to address the unique cybersecurity challenges faced by the railway industry, ensuring comprehensive protection through seamless integration and continuous monitoring of evolving threats. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a multi-layered security framework that addresses both current and legacy system vulnerabilities. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a multi-layered security framework that addresses both current and legacy system vulnerabilities. The study not only identifies critical gaps, but also provides new risk management solutions by reviewing recent advances in cybersecurity standards and conducting a detailed analysis of cyberattacks on railway infrastructure. These solutions provide a more resilient approach to securing rail systems against evolving cyber threats, with a focus on continuous monitoring, AI-driven threat detection, and stronger integration of cybersecurity with operational safety protocols.</p><p>The detailed answers to all these questions are highlighted in the present document, which is organized as follows. <xref rid="sec2-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="sec">Section 2</xref> presents understanding systems, threats, and infrastructure of railway cybersecurity. <xref rid="sec3-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="sec">Section 3</xref> highlights comprehensive cyber strategies for railway systems. <xref rid="sec4-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="sec">Section 4</xref> presents risk management strategies for railway infrastructure to mitigate cybersecurity threats.

From Safety to Security: Comprehensive Cyber Strategies for Railway&#x000a0;Systems</title><sec id="sec3dot1-sensors-24-08218"><title>3.1. Rail Cybersecurity vs. Rail&#x000a0;Safety</title><p>For railway architecture, safety and cybersecurity share the same goal: to ensure that passengers and employees are not put at risk and that trains run on schedule. However, the two concepts should not be confused [<xref rid="B5-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], or they will not be adequately addressed. In the rail industry, safety is generally defined as protecting passengers and systems from unintentional harm, such as deficient mechanisms, faulty lights, system bugs, and so on. On the other hand, cybersecurity is not about safety but about security: it is about protecting people and infrastructure from intentional harm caused by people with malicious intent. Unlike physical security, which is based on proven principles, cybersecurity never rests on its laurels. It must always stay one step ahead of increasingly sophisticated attackers. To ensure IT security, the rail industry must continually improve and enhance its cybersecurity solutions to meet the next emerging threat. A major obstacle to effective rail cybersecurity, however, is the difficulty of reconciling proven security protocols with cybersecurity systems that must constantly evolve.</p><p>Ref. [<xref rid="B6-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] offers an exhaustive examination of the security issues associated with CPS, with particular emphasis on threat models, attack methodologies, and strategies that can be deployed to enhance the security of railway systems. It draws attention to the fact that attacks on cyber&#x02013;physical components have the potential to compromise the overall safety and reliability of infrastructure. In considering the impact of cyberattacks on railway safety and cybersecurity, it is essential to examine the concept of Cyber&#x02013;Physical Systems (CPS) and their inherent security challenges, as presented in this paper. Given the complex nature of railway infrastructures, which comprise both physical components (e.g., on-board sensors and trackside equipment) and digital systems (e.g., communication networks and control systems), the security of these cyber&#x02013;physical systems is of paramount importance. The occurrence of cyberattacks on railway systems can have direct and severe impacts on both safety and operations. This is due to the fact that such attacks may lead to the compromise of the physical functioning of critical components. <xref rid="sensors-24-08218-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides a non-exhaustive collection of significant disclosed cybersecurity incidents that impacted transportation operations or threatened or had the potential to threaten transportation security. Note that we do not include cyber incidents that resulted solely in the theft or compromise of data. While the earliest incidents may have directly impacted transportation operations and safety, the most recent ransomware attacks did not affect critical rail sensors, but they did significantly disrupt transportation services.</p><p>A closer examination of the incidents reveals that the sensors most affected are ticketing, passenger information, CCTV, on-board Wi-Fi, and entertainment systems [<xref rid="B25-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Fortunately, in the vast majority of cases, operational technology (OT) systems are secure, and the problems were either minor or unknown. These examples show that rail IT systems have been the primary focus. However, as systems become more interconnected, signaling, control, and telematics are increasingly vulnerable to such attacks, especially with the diversity of rail sensors, as shown in <xref rid="sensors-24-08218-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>To provide a comprehensive analysis of the case studies presented in the article, it is essential to delve deeper into the specific threats, vulnerabilities, and technical intricacies associated with each cybersecurity incident.

Cybersecurity Issues and Problems&#x000a0;Classification</title><p>An interdependent group of stakeholders operates, manages, and maintains the rail infrastructure. A secure and safe environment for sharing data and computational models, and for storing, accessing, and processing data over the long life of the assets, will facilitate the creation of appropriate decision-support tools. The first steps in creating such an environment will be an analysis of the needs of the railway stakeholders, interdependencies, processes, maintenance layout, etc. The classification of problems and difficulties formed during this study has been categorized into three categories: governance, business, and technology, as shown in <xref rid="sensors-24-08218-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p><p>There are numerous cyberattacks that can corrupt or damage physical or digital infrastructure, causing everything from minor disruptions to loss of life in terms of operations and equipment. Cybersecurity is a continuous effort; the security team must close all potential gaps, while attackers only need to identify a few openings. Adequate security coverage depends on updating both technological and human factor requirements and requires addressing numerous system design areas. It must also be continuously monitored and improved. To achieve confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and to balance the security objectives of the collaborators for access control, information transmission, and data storage, multiple layers of security are needed to provide overall security for the collaboration and sharing of information sharing among the railway partners. A unified information security system that outlines security protocols and requirements should integrate all security requirements. The operation of railway systems depends on the use of a variety of communication protocols that facilitate the exchange of data between different components, including sensors, actuators and control systems. Among these, the following protocols are particularly prevalent:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>MVB (Multifunctional Vehicle Bus) is a communication network deployed in trains to connect subsystems such as those controlling the braking, signaling, and other safety-critical functions. However, despite its safety-critical applications, the MVB is vulnerable to interception and spoofing attacks.</p></list-item><list-item><p>CAN (Controller Area Network) is a communication protocol frequently utilized in train control systems. It enables interconnection between various embedded systems. However, CAN is vulnerable to message replay and arbitration attacks, wherein a malicious actor gains control of the communication bus and modifies the transmitted data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>TCP/IP is employed in the context of broader railway communication networks, including those between central control systems and maintenance stations. Potential vulnerabilities associated with TCP/IP include Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and unauthorized access, which may occur if the necessary security measures are not implemented effectively.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Even for hardware, we must take the following into consideration:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Vulnerability of Physical Devices: It is common for railway systems to utilize a range of hardware components, including sensors, actuators, and communication devices. The potential for these tangible items to become susceptible to security breaches is heightened when their physical composition is not adequately protected against the evolving nature of modern cyber threats.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Secure Hardware Design: Research into secure hardware design is ongoing, with a particular focus on the creation of tamper-resistant devices and the integration of security features directly into the hardware. One example of such a security feature is the Trusted Platform Module (TPM).</p></list-item></list></p><p>By elucidating the prospective ramifications of digital attacks on the operations and safety of railway systems, it is possible to a gain greater comprehension of the gravity of the situation. Such considerations may include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Operational disruptions: A cyberattack has the potential to result in system outages, which could in turn lead to train delays or cancellations. To illustrate, ransomware attacks have the potential to render operators unable to access critical systems, resulting in considerable disruption to the provision of services.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Safety Risks: It is important to consider how cyber-related incidents could potentially compromise safety systems, for instance, train signaling or braking systems, which may ultimately result in accidents. One such example would be an attack on signaling systems, which could lead to train collisions or derailments.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Financial Impact: The financial impact of cyber incidents must be emphasized. This encompasses the costs associated with recovery, legal liability and reputational damage. It has been demonstrated that a significant cyber incident can result in a financial loss of millions of dollars for railway companies. This is due to the combined effect of direct and indirect costs incurred. A predictive analytics for future threats by forecasting vulnerabilities and financial impacts helps in proactive planning, as presented in <xref rid="sensors-24-08218-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-sensors-24-08218"><title>3.3.

By employing encryption, authentication, firewalls, and AI-driven monitoring, railway networks can fortify their resilience against an array of cyber threats. This approach offers greater technical depth and actionable insights, enabling the rail industry to discern the specific steps necessary to bolster security measures in railway systems.

Regulations vary in different countries, but are generally designed to mitigate the risk of cyberattacks and improve security across railway systems. Discussions were held with relevant railway stakeholders to identify the most popular risk management techniques currently used by RUs and IMs. During these sessions, the participants made their choice of methods. As required by standards that include human factors, an independent cybersecurity assessment can be performed on any equipment or part of the rail system that sends, processes, or receives data to ensure that these data have not been altered, corrupted, or intercepted for inappropriate use. <xref rid="sensors-24-08218-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> shows good frameworks from the cybersecurity literature.</p><p>IEC 62443 and prTS 50701 are two examples of great security recommendations, standards, and frameworks.

Risk Management Mechanisms and&#x000a0;Approaches</title><p>Passenger and freight trains are becoming more mobile as rail networks and traffic volumes expand, requiring increased protection. The rail system and rolling stock are perfectly safe, but accidents do occur, requiring the highest level of risk management expertise [<xref rid="B27-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As NIS 2.0 fines approach GDPR [<xref rid="B28-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] charges, cybersecurity of OT systems will become a major topic in future committee meetings. The question is, how much investment is required to effectively manage all these risks? The required investment is determined by the desired level of security and practices, as well as the organization&#x02019;s risk tolerance. Traditional IT organizations typically spend 3&#x02013;6% of their annual IT budget on cybersecurity risks, which include spending on security hardware and software, technical expertise and salaries, workflow development and maintenance, and so on. In the United States, the first cybersecurity regulations for rail transit will not be implemented until the end of 2021. Two cybersecurity mandates will be imposed by the federal government on &#x0201c;high-risk&#x0201d; rail systems and rail transit systems. The new security measures will require critical passenger and freight railroads to:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Review cybersecurity risks to the federal government within 24 h;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Assign a Cybersecurity Contact Person who is available 24 h a day, seven days a week;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Create an incident response plan;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Conduct a vulnerability analysis.</p></list-item></list></p><p>To achieve the appropriate level of sophistication for OT and IT risk management needs, they are complemented or coupled with other strategies. Their strategies must provide an acceptable level of compliance with local cybersecurity standards, and are linked to the organization&#x02019;s broader enterprise risk management strategy. National rules under the NIS Directive have not been fully synchronized, which creates additional compliance issues for RUs and IMs operating in different EU Member States. Support from the railway sector is needed for all EU RUs and IMs to comply with the cybersecurity standards set by their national competent authorities. RUs and IMs depend on their suppliers to implement cybersecurity standards and to conduct more accurate vulnerability and threat assessments. Therefore, as the rail market transitions from a traditional, mechanical, and heavy industry to a more connected environment, it is necessary to rely on new reference documents and standards. In fact, there are multiple and diverse methodologies in use across the rail industry, but each may have a different scope and level of analysis. Although there are some regulations from other countries and sectors, such as ISO 2700X, IEC 62443, or the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) cybersecurity framework, the requirements of the NIS Directive functions at the national level. The frameworks mentioned for operational technology systems were [<xref rid="B4-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B29-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], or [<xref rid="B31-sensors-24-08218" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These guidelines and methodologies are often used in a complementary manner to effectively address either OT or IT infrastructure. OT systems require specialized techniques and frameworks designed for industrial railway systems, while IT systems are typically examined using broader and more generic techniques (such as <italic toggle="yes">ISO 2700x or NIS Directive</italic>).

The standards listed in ISO 27001 and 27002 should be considered when developing a risk management strategy. Risk management is emphasized in ISO 27005, which is used as an important guideline to manage and mitigate risks to an acceptable level by being able to perform a cybersecurity service from the beginning of the design activities (review of cybersecurity management plans, asset evaluation, incident management, etc.) to the testing activities (evaluation of white/gray/black box tests and review of attack scenarios and their consequences).
