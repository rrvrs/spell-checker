Psychopathological, psychometric (PANSS, HAMD, CDSS, MoCA) and statistical methods were applied.</p></sec><sec id="sec3405"><title>Results</title><p>3 clinical groups were allocated. The 1<sup>st</sup> group included 15 patients (33%) and was characterized with severe polymorphic psychotic symptoms, included catatonic and paraphrenic signs with mental disorganization. They had the highest score of&#x000a0;PANSS (105,46&#x000b1;17,99, p=0,002) and the lowest score of MoCA (14,2&#x000b1;2,16, p=0,05) in compare with 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> groups. They also had symptoms of depression (CDSS 6,28&#x000b1;5,29), compared with the 3<sup>rd</sup> group (HAMD 21,00&#x000b1;5,92, p=0,05). In short-terms outcomes was formed&#x000a0;negative symptoms and cognitive impairment with decreasing social and daily activity. The 2<sup>nd</sup> group (22 cases, 49%) included patients with prevalence of delusions of persecution, more rare auditory hallucinations and more often acoasms. They had medium score PANSS (90,22&#x000b1;16,79), with minimal cognitive declare (MoCA average score 20,33&#x000b1;4,27). The short-term outcomes were characterized with formation of residual positive and negative symptoms, that impact on daily and social activity. The 3<sup>rd</sup> group included 8 patients (8%) with prevalence of delusion symptoms, such as misidentification, persecutory and reference delusions, which were mood-congruent. They had medium PANSS score (89,75&#x000b1;18,90) with more severe depressive symptoms by HAMD scale in compare with 2<sup>nd</sup> group (22,00&#x000b1;10,00, p=0,07) and minimal cognitive declare (MoCA average score 25,00&#x000b1;1,00, p=0,05) in compare with 1<sup>st</sup> group. This group was characterized with high level of reduction of productive symptoms and restoration of premorbid social and daily activity in short-term outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec3406"><title>Conclusions</title><p>features of clinical characteristics, including the nature and severity of cognitive impairment at the onset of disease, are significant for prognosis and outcomes of disease.
