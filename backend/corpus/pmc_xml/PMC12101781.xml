</self-uri><abstract><p>Currently there are no surgical solutions to restore vision in the irreversibly blind. Whole eye transplantation (WET), is an appealing surgical approach for restoration, replacement, and reconstruction of nonfunctioning eyes. Development of a reliable animal model to test the integrity and functionality of the transplanted eye is an essential step towards clinical whole eye transplantation. This study presents a feasible vascularized orthotopic eye transplantation preclinical rat model to study the structural and functional outcomes of whole eye transplantation. Syngeneic orthotopic transplants were performed in rats, involving anastomoses between carotid arteries, external jugular veins, and optic nerve coaptations of donors and recipients. The transplanted and recipient native eyes were assessed by ocular exam under anesthesia, optical coherence tomography (OCT), histology, magnetic resonance imaging and electroretinography. A 100% surgical survival rate of recipients with maintained long-term health demonstrated this to be a reliable and reproducible model. Assessment from clinical examination under anesthesia revealed that segments of native eyes appeared normal throughout the duration of the study, but transplanted eyes presented mild chemosis of the eye lids, mild ciliary flush of the conjunctiva, cornea neovascularization, mild engorgement of the vessels in the iris, and mild opacities in the lens in some animals. Most of these findings improved over time after transplantation. Doppler optical coherence tomography corroborated the presence of blood flow in transplanted retinas. There was no significant difference in measured IOP between native and transplanted eyes. Both histology and OCT scans demonstrated increased central corneal thickness and decreased total retinal thickness in transplanted eyes. Transplanted eyes exhibit minimal scotopic and photopic ERG responses. To date, no other vascularized orthotopic rodent WET transplantation models have been described in the literature. As functional visual return remains the ultimate goal, this model provides a foundation for future translational strategies and is ideal for testing immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and neuroregenerative approaches either individually or in combination, as required for total human eye allotransplantation (THEA) to become a clinical reality.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

For these cases, etiologies include malformation, infection, chronic disease, and trauma [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Visual disabilities significantly reduce quality of life, social interactions, and life expectancy which represents a global economic burden [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Currently there are no surgical solutions to restore vision in the irreversibly blind. However, over the past 20 years, vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) has emerged as a viable reconstructive option for treating carefully selected patients [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Different than solid organ transplantation (SOT), VCA includes the reconstructive transplantation of multiple tissues, including muscle, nerves, blood vessels, and skin from donor to recipient as a functional unit. VCA can restore form and function to patients with a severe injury or defect that are outside conventional reconstructive techniques. More than one hundred hand and face VCAs have been documented, with promising functional outcomes with graft survival that surpasses 95% when patients adhere to immunosuppressive regimes after antibody-based lymphocyte-depleting induction therapy and rehabilitative regimes [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since the pioneering case performed in 2005, over forty facial allotransplantation (FT) procedures have been completed, producing remarkable functional outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Among all FTs cases, 54% included restoration of periorbital components. Among these FTs, 13% were blind [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] with at least three FT recipients presenting with total bilateral blindness. Insomuch, FT candidates with blindness seem to be good first candidates for VCA eye transplantation, due to their pre-existing immunosuppression requirement, along with the inherently close anatomic relation of ocular tissues with the face. Such factors might decrease the risk: benefit ratio in these patients compared with isolated eye transplantation.</p><p>The concept of eye transplantation dates back to 1885, when M. Chibret unsuccessfully transplanted a rabbit eye into a seventeen-year-old blind girl [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Over the next 100 years, reported attempts to restore functional vision in either mammalian models or humans by whole eye transplantation (WET) had all failed [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In 1977, the advisory council for the U.S. National Eye Institute (NEI) called for a &#x0201c;limited and thoughtful laboratory effort&#x0201d; in eye transplantation. The council concluded that &#x0201c;at present, any effort to transplant a mammalian eye is doomed to failure by the retinal ganglion cell axons&#x02019; inability to withstand cutting, by the difficulty of ensuring adequate circulation of blood to the transplanted eye, and lastly by immune rejection of foreign tissue&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Given the success of VCA over the past two decades, VCA of the whole eye is an appealing surgical approach for restoration, replacement, and reconstruction of nonfunctioning eyes. Consideration of the recent advances in immunomodulation strategies, promising approaches to enhance nerve regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), and an improved understanding of ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), the possibility of future clinical WET has been reinvigorated [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For this to happen, eye transplantation still needs significant research and progress has been stymied by the lack of high throughput animal models to address the major barriers impeding translation to the clinic.</p><p>Development of reliable animal models is vital to optimize new and complex surgical procedures. Additionally, cadaveric studies and patient trials are prerequisites for any new clinical surgeries [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Historically, there has been great difficulty in establishing a consistent small animal model for conducting basic science research of eye transplantation [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Optimizing surgical revascularization techniques, immunomodulation, and neuroregenerative therapies all require using small-animal models that closely recapitulate human physiology and anatomy. Use of rodent models to investigate VCA outcomes is well established, dating to 1936 with the first reports of experimental VCA in rat by Schwind [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Compared with larger animal models, inbred rats are genetically identical, allowing control of many experimental variables [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, the branching pattern of the arterial anatomy is comparable in rats and humans, with some notable differences. In the rat, the ophthalmic artery branches off the internal carotid and then travels along the optic nerve sheath. The rat central retinal artery branches from the ophthalmic artery and enters the globe to supply blood to the retina but does not penetrate the optic nerve sheath or head, as it does in humans. Therefore, experiments that investigate optic nerve damage and regeneration can include or exclude the effects of ischemia by separating the optic nerve from the central retinal artery. Previously, we established a rat hemifacial VCA model to study functional outcomes and cortical reintegration after FT [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The present study expands that model to include the entire ocular globe (whole eye), optic nerve, and its blood supply to yield a novel vascularized, orthotopic rodent eye transplant model for studying the structural and functional outcomes following WET.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Eye transplant surgery and post-operative monitoring</title><p>Syngeneic whole eye transplantation was performed using 23 pairs of age matched male Lewis (RT1) rats to generate n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4-6/group/timepoint for downstream structural and functional assessment (Figs 1-3).

Mild corneal defects were found at PO week 7 in 2/13 eyes. Of these two eyes, one (1/13) also had mild neovascularization of the cornea at PO 7 week. Fundoscopic evaluation of the native retina and optic nerve head was normal for all animals at all of the examination sessions. No signs of inflammation were observed in either the vitreous or retina of native eyes at all exam timepoints.</p><p>At PO week 1, 4/23 transplanted eyes displayed mild chemosis of the eyelid, which resolved at 30&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4 days after transplantation. Peripheral corneal neovascularization was seen in 9/23 transplanted eyes, with initial heterogenous presentation: PO week 1 (n&#x02009;= 4/23 eyes), PO week 3 (n&#x02009;= 5/23 eyes), PO week 5 (n&#x02009;= 2/13 eyes), PO week 7 (n&#x02009;= 4/13 eyes) and this condition persisted in all cases with increased severity at subsequent exam timepoints. After WET, the lens remained clear in 21/23 transplanted eyes until the sacrifice endpoint. Mild-to-moderate cataracts were observed in two transplanted eyes (2/13) at PO 7 week. Of these two affected eyes, one also presented with a severe epithelial defect with moderate peripheral neovascularization in the cornea. In the second case, severe corneal edema obstructed the view of the posterior segment. The other 21 eyes were unobstructed, presenting a clear cornea and lens at each exam, but all the irises were dilated. At all exam time points, observable pupils were dilated and non-reactive for transplanted eyes. Anterior chamber inflammation with turbid view was detected in only one case at PO week 3 (1/23) and this condition persisted until the study endpoint. At PO week 1, 23/23 WET retinas were visible and attached, but as mentioned above, posterior segment exam was eventually limited in two transplanted eyes (2/13) due to a blocked view secondary to an opaque cornea at PO week 7. Of these transplanted eyes, 10/11 presented mild-to-severe peripheral ischemia at PO week 1. This resolved in all eyes except for 2 cases by PO week 3, which then persisted until the study endpoint. In all cases, the peripheral retina appeared to be less perfused than the posterior pole. Most optic disc and posterior pole regions of the retina appeared to be perfused (22/23) at PO week 1, although 10/23 were hypoperfused. Optic nerve heads appeared pink, healthy, and perfused in all observable cases, except for one eye with mild pallor at PO weeks 3 and 5, which increased to a total of two eyes at PO week 7.

We present limited preliminary outcomes using a series of clinical examinations, OCT imaging, electrophysiology, MRI, and histology. Non-invasive methods of testing will be critical for clinical WET. We show these methods can be used to collect data on the health of the eye, assess changes in morphology, and monitor eye physiology and functionality. The 100% surgical survival rate of recipients and long-term health (PO week 7) demonstrate this to be a reliable and reproducible model. Moreover, the aim of maintaining relative morphological integrity of a vascularized composite eye transplant was demonstrated by noninvasive ophthalmological assessments including ocular exam (<xref rid="pone.0311392.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) and OCT scans (<xref rid="pone.0311392.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). OCT findings were confirmed by histology (<xref rid="pone.0311392.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Overall, all segments of native eyes appeared normal throughout the duration of the study, but transplanted eyes presented mild chemosis of the eye lids, mild ciliary flush of the conjunctiva, cornea neovascularization, mild engorgement of the vessels in the iris, and mild opacities in the lens in some animals. Most of these findings improved over time after transplantation (<xref rid="pone.0311392.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">ST1</xref>). Although transplanted eyes were vascularly intact with a patent vascular network, all of their pupils were dilated and unreactive, possibly due to damaged optic and ciliary nerves or anterior segment ischemia [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Restoration of vascularity to the VCA eye graft and other physiological and functional assessments were also conducted including tonometry to record IOP (<xref rid="pone.0311392.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">SF3</xref>), MRI to assess aqueous humor dynamics (<xref rid="pone.0311392.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>), ODT to assess blood flow (<xref rid="pone.0311392.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">SF2</xref>, SM1, SM2), and ERG (<xref rid="pone.0311392.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>) to assess retinal function after WET.</p><p>The number of additional tests that can be conducted on this WET model are too many to list. This apparent study limitation, however, could also be considered as a testament to the utility of our WET model. Future assessment of this WET model should consider evaluating consensual pupillary light reflex to the native eye, which exists in rats (though small) and is independent of oculomotor innervation and could indicate whether the efferent arm of the reflex has been completely restored. Pupillometry is another potential non-invasive, longitudinal measure of optic nerve function. Future studies may take advantage of the modular nature of this WET model and choose to restore the pupil response, blink reflex, and eyelid control as desired to address this issue. Restoration of blink reflex by repairing Cranial Nerves (CN) V and CN VII could reduce exposure and improve the health of the transplanted eye. Furthermore, integrity of the anterior segment tissues including eyelid function and pre-ocular tear film integrity will most likely affect patient comfort, cosmesis, and function, all issues that complicate clinical WET. In addition to the tests conducted herein or previously mentioned, esthesiometer measurements of corneal sensitivity to mechanical stimuli could show the physiology of an expanded version of our model that retains motor output in response to afferent signaling from the trigeminal nerve. Recording visual evoked potentials (VEP) to monitor the integrity of the afferent visual pathway will have a greater role in future studies that incorporate neuroregenerative strategies for the transected optic nerve. Finally, male rats were used exclusively for their physical size, making surgery easier. It has not escaped the authors that future work should consider associated sex differences and inclusion of female rats.</p><p>Restoration and maintenance of vascular perfusion to the graft is critical for successful transplantation. We observed perfusion for all WET ocular and facial allografts that presented pink viable skin, indicating restoration of vascular blood supply (<xref rid="pone.0311392.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0311392.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">SF1</xref>). Likewise, ODT scans corroborated the presence of blood flow in the transplanted retina (<xref rid="pone.0311392.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">SF2</xref>, SM2). Our model can be used to explore the impact of IRI in the setting of WET and to elucidate IRI mechanisms that remain largely undefined [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. An understanding of these processes will be critical for the success of clinical WET. Future work on the restoration of vascularity should include fluorescein angiography (FA), which allows visualization and measurement of the circulation of the retina and choroid. FA could be used to measure filling of the choroid and retinal vasculature to reveal potential capillary leak, and also record potential changes in fill time among other issues following WET induced by IRI or retinal hypoxia [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These events might result in subsequent neovascular glaucoma and chorioretinopathy, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Mainly composed of a blood aqueous barrier and a blood-retinal barrier, the blood-ocular barrier necessitates alternative nourishment and protection of the avascular eye components. FA can be used to assess both the integrity of the vascular system and also the integrity of the blood-ocular barrier.</p><p>Aqueous humor is a clear fluid that fills the anterior segment and posterior chambers of the eye, acting in place of blood to support the avascular lens and the cornea. Regulation of the production and drainage of aqueous humor is critical for maintaining physiologically appropriate IOP [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We recorded IOP in two WET cohorts, for rats that underwent OCT and also prior to MRI recordings. For both cohorts, native eyes were hypotonic compared with either na&#x000ef;ve or transplanted eyes at all timepoints, although the significance varied depending on the comparison. Comparing IOP for na&#x000ef;ve <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> transplanted or transplanted <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> native eyes did not reveal significant differences at all timepoints (S3). Moreover, the mean IOPs recorded for na&#x000ef;ve, native and transplanted eyes were similar to the mean IOP value of ~&#x02009;17.13 mmHg previously reported for na&#x000ef;ve Lewis rats in a comprehensive study conducted by Mermoud <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] IOP reading for transplanted eyes was within the reported normal range, although the observations of increased CCT for transplanted eyes were likely secondary to corneal&#x000a0;edema. Thicker or steeper CCT is known to elevate measured IOP due to reduced corneal flexibility, and the effect is even greater particularly when presented in conjunction with other corneal pathology [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. After WET, transplanted eyes indicated ocular surface deterioration as well as corneal and conjunctival pathology. These included: conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, corneal epithelial defect, infiltration, and neovascularization (<xref rid="pone.0311392.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">ST1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0311392.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">SF2</xref>B). These findings could result from a damaged blink response, exposure keratopathy, hypoperfusion following WET, or ischemia of the flap and anterior segment. It&#x02019;s difficult to determine what to make of our observations, especially as the reported normal mean IOP from Mermoud <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> was derived from a very large IOP range, from 7.28-26.98 mmHg. Excepting for cannulation of the eye for IOP accuracy, the transplanted eye IOP measurements indicate some functionality of homeostatic mechanisms and trabecular tissues after WET. Although transplanted eye IOP is within the normal reported range, our Gd-MRI results suggested some compromise in functional homeostatic mechanisms (<xref rid="pone.0311392.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0311392.g007" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Monitoring aqueous humor dynamics by Gd-MRI involves systemic administration of exogenous Gd to passively trace aqueous humor flow, which begins with its secretion from the ciliary processes and then circulates to the posterior chamber <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the blood&#x02013;aqueous barrier. Contrast agents such as Gd chelates are highly water-soluble, extracellularly distributed, and eliminated rapidly through renal glomerular filtration Such agents serve to improve the sensitivity and specificity of MRI, allowing for easier differentiating between an area of interest and its surroundings [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. As Gd diffuses and follows aqueous humor flow, it accumulates in the anterior chamber and can be measured by drawing regions of interest (ROIs) on the anterior chamber of both eyes and obtaining their signal time profiles in T1-weighted MRI [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] Fig 7C-F show no difference in signal time profiles of the vitreous between transplanted and native eyes at PO week 3. This suggests that the aqueous-vitreous barrier and blood-retinal barrier were preserved in transplanted eyes and that exogenous Gd could not leak into the vitreous. Despite this, we observed a modest but significantly slower initial appearance of the Gd signal in the transplanted eyes when compared with the native eyes. The overall amplitude of the Gd signal in the transplanted eyes was also significantly (<italic toggle="yes">P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;</italic>0.01) smaller than that in the native eyes. These observations suggest slower Gd entrance and aqueous inflow to the transplanted eyes. This slowing might arise from the effects of IRI [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, future longitudinal Gd-MRI studies to monitor the remodeling of aqueous humor dynamics in transplanted eyes, and DTI studies should be performed in conjunction with strategies to minimize IRI and restore neuronal structure and function of the visual system using this WET model. It will be interesting to use Gd-MRI to see if any long-term reorganization of the vascular system and potential angiogenesis of small vessels feeding the system might promote recovery over periods greater than PO week 3. Such reorganization occurs in other VCA surgeries such as face transplantation [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Other possibilities that might account for a slower aqueous inflow include observed differences in perfusion after transplant, immediately and longitudinally in different tissues. This has been reported in syngeneic rat pancreas-duodenum transplantation, where blood perfusion of the graft is markedly changed whereas islet blood perfusion remains constant [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Additional work with this model should seek to provide greater detail of aqueous humor dynamics following WET, at a finer level and include examination of aqueous humor dynamics using other imaging techniques such as FA.</p><p>Ischemia is unavoidable in any transplantation, and graft survival is highly dependent on minimizing the potential damage incurred by duration of ischemia and subsequent reperfusion. We presented changes in CCT and TRT following WET using both histology and OCT scans, demonstrating that transplanted CCT increased relative to native or na&#x000ef;ve eyes, whereas transplanted eye TRT decreased relative to native or na&#x000ef;ve eyes (<xref rid="pone.0311392.g005" ref-type="fig">Figs 5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0311392.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These changes could be due to ischemia itself or inflammation secondary to ischemia [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Accordingly, we observed anterior chamber fibrinous reaction, which is a sign of ocular ischemia and is associated with corneal epithelial irregularity and thickening of the cornea [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. TRT and CCT measurements differed when measured from OCT scans or histological preparations (<xref rid="pone.0311392.g005" ref-type="fig">Figs 5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0311392.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). For example, at PO week 7, transplant CCT measured 247.18&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;55.47 &#x000b5;m by OCT and 342.34&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;80.03 &#x000b5;m in histological sections, although in both cases, this thicker CCT represented approximately ~&#x02009;2-fold increase relative to native CCT. OCT measurement of CCT for male rats was reported as 159.08&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14.99 &#x003bc;m (Min 122.3 &#x003bc;m, Max 181.3 &#x003bc;m). Meanwhile, reported CCT from paraffin slides was 126.89&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.11 &#x003bc;m in eight Lewis rats and the authors described that the fixation process induced shrinkage of up to 20% compared with the living cornea [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Aside from potential distortion in measurements from histological processing, the ischemia time for the two cohorts might influence measured values. For the WET histological samples at PO 3 and 7 weeks, mean warm ischemia was 120.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14.2&#x02009;min (mean&#x000b1;SD) whereas mean warm ischemia for the WET OCT cohort was 138&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;16.8&#x02009;min (mean&#x000b1;SD).</p><p>The CCT for na&#x000ef;ve eyes measured by OCT averaged 205.67&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.92 &#x000b5;m for the entire study (mean&#x000b1;SD). Previously, CCT for male Brown Norway rats measured by OCT was reported as 159.08&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14.99 &#x003bc;m (mean&#x000b1;SD; Min 122.3 &#x003bc;m, Max 181.3 &#x003bc;m; weight: 391&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;64&#x02009;g; age: 10&#x02013;28 months). TRT has been reported to be 201.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.00 (&#x003bc;m&#x000b1;SEM) [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and either 132.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;21.4 (&#x003bc;m&#x000b1;SEM) for 3 months old (considered as young), or 210&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;31.6 (&#x003bc;m&#x000b1;SEM) for 12 months old (considered as adult) Sprague&#x02013;Dawley male rats, measured by Scanning electron microscopy [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Histological measurement of TRT in 13 week old male Wistar rats weighing ~&#x02009;250g, is reported to be ~&#x02009;212.5 &#x003bc;m [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Accordingly, measurement of CCT and TRT for na&#x000ef;ve rats used in this study fell within the previously reported range. Our OCT imaging at PO week 3 showed that the retinas in the transplanted eyes were thinner relative to the native eyes, and that the inner retinal hyperreflective zone was thicker in transplanted eyes, which represents inner ischemic retinal tissue. In native eyes, it represents the nerve fiber layer, and that the choroid is thinner in transplanted eyes. These results were present when retinal layer changes were measured in histological samples (<xref rid="pone.0311392.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Altogether, the model reveals that IRI remains a major challenge in successful WET. Histological measurements of individual retinal layers of transplanted eyes revealed that inner retinal layers such as the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) suffered greater relative loss in thickness after WET whereas outer layers such as the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and the photoreceptors (PL) showed some sparing and had greater survival when compared with native or na&#x000ef;ve retinal layers at PO week 7 (one-tailed paired t-tests, <italic toggle="yes">P&#x02009;=&#x02009;</italic>0.01).</p><p>Corneal and retinal OCT and histology demonstrated persistent changes to the native recipient eye following WET (<xref rid="pone.0311392.g005" ref-type="fig">Figs 5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0311392.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Native TRT decreased to 185.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.55 &#x000b5;m at PO week 1, representing ~&#x02009;85% of na&#x000ef;ve TRT. This thinning was stationary in subsequent assessments, measuring 177.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.44 &#x000b5;m at PO week 7 (<xref rid="pone.0311392.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). Changes to cornea and retina were not as dramatic as measured by OCT <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> histology, possibly due to the various effects of histologic preparation, such as shrinkage, swelling or dehydration. For example, OCT measurement of retinal thickness at PO week 7 found transplant eyes decreased 50.2% when compared with native eyes, whereas this was markedly higher at 77.8% loss in histological samples. Previous studies have shown good correlation between OCT and histological values; however, researchers should be cautioned to consider the methodologies that are employed [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Regardless, the loss in TRT after optic nerve transection is not without precedent and our model provides a platform to study potential optic nerve regeneration and RGC preservation in the setting of WET [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The cause of our observation is unknown and should be explored in future work.</p><p>Although this study did not involve neurodegenerative or neuroprotective therapies to address the retinal degeneration typically associated with optic nerve injury, functional testing was performed to establish a baseline and assess the potential for functional recovery. Electroretinography (ERG) is a common non-invasive method to objectively measure functional changes of the retina, by recording the electrical responses of retinal cells to a light stimulus in either dark-adapted (scotopic) or light-adapted (photopic) conditions. A reduction in ERG amplitude is expected after optic nerve injury and this correlates with our histological findings (<xref rid="pone.0311392.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Although the gross appearance of the transplanted retinal structure appears intact at PO week 3 (<xref rid="pone.0311392.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>), the measurements of TRT of transplanted eyes reveal substantial loss over time. Increased b-wave implicit time could arise from a dysfunction in ON and OFF pathways in the middle retinal layers (primarily from amacrine cells) and rod bipolar pathways [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This possibility is supported by our observation of marked recession of those retinal sublayers. In transplanted eyes, the GCL exhibited greater loss than the PL compared with native eyes, in agreement with reports that RGCs and cells of the inner layers are less resistant than the outer retina to ischemic and hypoxic stress. It is known that normal photoreceptor proteins exist in degenerated rods and cones, suggesting that these cells may be capable of functional regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], and display a greater resilience to hypoxia along with ischemia by outer layer retinal cells. This may account for the sparing of albeit weak photoreceptor functionality after WET, despite retinal degeneration that follows optic nerve transection. Future studies to examine these phenomena might include differential labeling of the photoreceptor layer by using rod and cone specific staining, combined with RGC-specific stains.</p><p>As functional visual return remains the ultimate goal, this model provides a foundation for future translational strategies and is ideal for testing immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and neurodegenerative approaches either individually or in combination, as required for total human eye allotransplantation (THEA) to become a clinical reality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To date, no other vascularized orthotopic rodent WET transplantation models have been described in the literature. The advantages of an orthotopic model are numerous but the simplest is the obvious anatomic relevance to a future clinical WET procedure. The preference for orthotopic rather than heterotopic models extends to areas of biomedical research, including pancreatic tumor mouse models. Of the two, orthotopic tumor mouse models are preferred because they offer tissue site-specific pathology, allow studies of metastasis, and are generally deemed more clinically relevant. An orthotopic model of WET with repair of the donor and recipient optic nerves also allows for the study of optic nerve regeneration and cortical reintegration into the visual cortex. Importantly, we have developed an orthotopic model that is highly modular with surgical options to allow for additional investigation of other topics directly related to WET [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Overall, we anticipated many of the transplant pathologies observed in this novel WET model. We have demonstrated its potential use to study axonal regeneration beyond the optic nerve to include other CNS trauma and disease or complications that follow VCA.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec013"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Animals.</title><p>Syngeneic transplantations were performed using 23 age-matched 10 to13 week-old pairs of male Lewis (RT1) rats (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA) with weights ranging from 290g-350g.

An elliptical incision was made around the eye and the auricle, leaving a 0.5-cm margin of skin. A linear incision was then made continuously with the elliptical incision to expose and dissect the common carotid artery and external jugular vein. After isolating the vascular pedicles, the dissection continued superiorly in a subperiosteal plane overlying the superior and anterior portion of the cranium. Flap elevation continued anterior to the masseter muscle. The orbital contents were isolated from the osseous orbit and raised with the flap. The zygomatic arch and surrounding muscles were removed. The muscles of the neck were severed from the attachments to the cranial bones. The external jugular vein and its branches were isolated at the proximal end. The common carotid artery was exposed, after cutting the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. The internal carotid system was procured and elevated with the flap. The branches of the external carotid artery, with the exception of the maxillary artery and posterior auricular artery, were ligated. The flap, while remaining attached to the rat, was perfused with heparinized Lactated Ringer&#x02019;s solution after sacrificing the rat with carbon dioxide. The optic nerve was transected at the chiasm.

The skin and the soft tissue overlying the masseter, the temporalis, and the sternocleidomastoid muscle ipsilateral to the donor flap were removed in the recipient rats. The facial nerve was kept intact. A segment of the temporalis muscle above the zygomatic arch was removed to facilitate the coaptation of the optic nerve and to provide space for the donor tissues. Exenteration was performed by removing the orbital contents with the optic nerve transected at the base of the globe. The external jugular vein was isolated and prepared for venous anastomosis.

Conjunctival, corneal, anterior chamber, iris, pupil, and lens findings were assessed and described, based on human ophthalmic standards, whenever there was adequate view for this evaluation. The retina and vitreous were examined using indirect ophthalmoscopy with 78-diopter lens following coating of the ocular surface with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Goniosol). Retinal perfusion was reported based on visible perfused vessels both in central and peripheral retina. Central retina was defined as the area with radius of 2 optic disc diameters from the optic nerve.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Optical coherence tomography (OCT).</title><p>After general anesthesia was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of 80&#x02009;mg/kg of ketamine/xylazine, the pupil was dilated with 1 drop each of 0.5% Tropicamide (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX) and Goniovisc 2.5% (Hypromellose, HUB Pharmaceuticals, LLC., Scottsdale, AZ) to prevent corneal desiccation. A spectral-domain OCT (Bioptigen, Durham, NC) equipped with a wide-bandwidth light source centered at 870&#x02009;nm (Superlum, Dublin, Ireland) was used to visualize a 2.5&#x02009;mm x 2.5&#x02009;mm x 2&#x02009;mm sample of the cornea, lens, and optic nerve head (ONH) with 512 x 512 x 1024-pixel samplings. For retinal OCT, rats were positioned such that the fundus was clear, and the optic disc centered. Each subject was scanned 1-3 times as necessary to produce a single scan/subject for analysis. Doppler OCT was performed in a 2.5mm x 2.5mm x 2mm (700 x 20 x 1024 samplings) region. Eight Doppler frames were acquired with an acquisition rate of 28&#x02009;kHz, resulting in a Nyquist limit of 4.62&#x02009;mm/s normal to the scanning beam.</p><p>Morphometric measurements were restricted to retinal regions outside a radius of 500&#x02009;mm from the center of the ONH. Retinal layer measurements were performed via the automated segmentation software provided by the instrument manufacturer (Bioptigen, Inc., Durham, NC). Corneal OCT measurement of corneal thickness was performed using Metamorph software, of the central part of the cornea from the epithelium to the endothelium. For OCT measurement of the retina, the central image of a cube OCT scan centered over the optic nerve head containing the widest diameter of the central vessels was chosen and imported into Metamorph (version 4.5r) Professional Image Analysis software, produced by Universal imaging, USA (ImagxCell). Then, from the centermost part of the vessel, 2 lines parallel to the inner retinal surface, each with a length of 100 pixels, was drawn outward on the two sides of the optic nerve. The following measurements were performed at 100 pixels from the center of the optic disc and perpendicular to the retina. TRT was measured from inner retina to the outer hyperreflective band. The inner hyperreflective zone (most probably representing nerve fiber layer in normal eye, and nerve fiber layer plus ischemic retina in transplanted eye) was measured from the inner retinal surface to the outer boundary of the inner hyperreflective layer. All measurements were then exported to Excel for analysis by Metamorph. A conversion factor of 1.6 for retinal images was used to change pixel measurements into micrometers (as the depth of OCT measurements was 1.6&#x02009;mm for 1024 image pixels in the retina OCTs). For each of the thicknesses, the mean of the two corresponding measurements on the two sides of the optic disc was used as the representative value for each eye.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-MRI), anatomical T2-weighted MRI and diffusion tensor MRI.</title><p>A subset of WET recipients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) underwent Gd-MRI, anatomical T2-weighted MRI, and diffusion tensor MRI at PO 3 week to assess aqueous humor dynamics, ocular tissue permeability, and the morphology and white-matter integrity of the optic nerve. At PO 1 week and 3 weeks, before MRI experiments, IOP was measured bilaterally according to manufacturer directions using the handheld Toolbar rebound tonometer (Icare, Finland) within 5&#x02009;min after isoflurane gas anesthesia induction in the afternoon. Additionally, IOP of age-matched naive animals was measured bilaterally for the same time points. Measurement for each eye was repeated 3 times and the average IOP and deviation was determined for each group (na&#x000ef;ve, native, transplant). MRI scans were performed using a 9.4-Tesla/31-cm Varian/Agilent scanner with a transmit-receive volume coil for Gd-MRI and T2-weighted MRI, and with a volume transmit and surface receive coil for diffusion tensor MRI. For Gd-MRI, gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA, Magnevist), 0.3mmol/kg, was introduced intraperitoneally after obtaining a baseline T1-weighted image. T1-weighted imaging at 30s-temporal resolution was then continuously acquired for 1.5 hours using a fast spin-echo sequence with the following imaging parameters: repetition time/echo time&#x02009;=&#x02009;600/8ms, echo train length =&#x02009;8, in-plane resolution =&#x02009;135x135&#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>, and slice thickness =&#x02009;1mm. Slices were oriented to bisect the center of the eyes. Anatomical T2-weighted MRI was acquired using a standard spin-echo imaging sequence. Diffusion tensor MRI was acquired before Gd-MRI using a fast spin-echo sequence with 12 diffusion gradient directions at diffusion weighting factor (b) =&#x02009;1.0ms/&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> and two b&#x02009;=&#x02009;0ms/&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>. Other imaging parameters included: repetition time/echo time =&#x02009;2300/27.8ms, echo train length =&#x02009;8, duration of diffusion gradient pulses (&#x003b4;)/time between diffusion gradient pulses (&#x00394;) =&#x02009;5/17ms, acquisition resolution =&#x02009;135x135&#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>, and slice thickness =&#x02009;0.5mm. Slices were oriented orthogonal to the prechiasmatic optic nerves. (FA) axial diffusivity (&#x003bb;//) and radial diffusivity (&#x003bb;&#x02534;) were computed using DTIStudio. ROIs were drawn on prechiasmatic optic nerves at approximately 3.5mm rostral to Bregma and compared bilaterally.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Histologic evaluation and analysis.</title><p>Prior to animal sacrifice at PO 3- and 7- weeks, eye globes were enucleated and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After 24-36 hours, eyes were transferred into 70% ethanol and stored for subsequent embedding in paraffin. Blocks were sectioned (10&#x000b5;m) and every twentieth section was stained with hematoxylin &#x00026; eosin (H&#x00026;E). Sections were independently evaluated by two trained individuals for all specimens in the study using digital images acquired from histological slides. Using ImageJ [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], the retinal sub-layers and total thickness of retinal sections were measured, and the values reported as an average of measurements obtained by the independent investigators as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Briefly, for each eye, one histological section (the middle most) was imaged using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon USA, Melville, NY, USA) with brightfield setting at 20x magnification. A scale bar was inserted in each image using the Nikon NIS Elements software. For total retinal thickness, 3 fields representing naso, central and temporal areas of each section were delineated, then measured at the section midpoint before the three values were averaged. ImageJ was used to set scale and then draw four measurement segments from top to bottom of each retinal layer or central cornea area; segment values were recorded and then averaged to determine the thickness in microns. Retinal layers were analyzed from the same images used to determine total retinal thickness. The central most corneal section per eye was selected for analysis. Final values represent the pooled mean &#x000b1;&#x02009; s.d. of the measurements obtained by the two independent researchers, with all values comporting to within 5% between independently acquired data sets.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Electroretinography (ERG).</title><p>In scotopic ERG, low-intensity light flashes can induce rod activation, so the function of rod photoreceptor and downstream retinal cells can be examined. In photopic ERG, high-intensity light flashes are presented after a period of light adaptation. Under these conditions, there is high cone activation, and the rod response is suppressed. The a-wave on the ERG reflects the responses of photoreceptors and the b-wave originates from the activity of retinal cells downstream from photoreception, mainly bipolar and M&#x000fc;ller cells [<xref rid="pone.0311392.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].</p><p>After overnight dark adaptation (minimum 12 hours), a subset of rats (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) at PO week 7 were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 80&#x02009;mg/kg of ketamine/xylazine, and pupils were dilated using topical application of 0.5% Tropicamide eye drops under dim red illumination. Full-field ERG responses were recorded using gold-wire loop electrodes precoated with a 2.5% Hypromellose lubricant solution (Goniovisc, HUB Pharmaceuticals). The reference needle electrode was inserted under the skin between the ears, and the ground needle electrode was inserted subcutaneously into the left hind limb. Full-field ERG was performed using an Espion Diagnosys system (Diagnosys LLC, Littleton, MA). ERG data were collected and analyzed with a custom script for MATLAB 8.5 (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). Only signals greater than three s.d. over noise were included for curve fitting in the analysis of a- and b-wave amplitude and implicit time for both native and transplanted eyes. During recordings, body temperature was maintained at 37&#x000b0;C with a platform heater. Scotopic light stimuli ranged from 0.1x10<sup>-6</sup> to 200 cd&#x000b7;s&#x000b7;m<sup>&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;2</sup> using a ColorDome unit to produce a single flash in a light-sealed room. To ensure complete recovery of b-wave amplitude, the interstimulus interval between the six intensities progressively increased from 10 to 120 seconds. After scotopic ERG evaluation, animals were given 10 minutes of light adaptation. The rats then were exposed to photopic light flash ranging from 3x10<sup>-3</sup> to 16 cd&#x000b7;s&#x000b7;m<sup>&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;2</sup> ramping over eight intensities in semi-log unit increments. Each record is an average of 20 responses obtained with a 2 second interstimulus interval.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>Power analysis was used to determine the number of experimental animals used in each group/timepoint/assessment as previously described. Using G&#x02009;*&#x02009;power software (G&#x02009;*&#x02009;power software 3.1.9.2, Germany), we calculated the effect size to be 0.6 according to our previous experiments.

After log transformation of light intensities and ERG responses, a well-defined nonlinear pattern was revealed. Log b-wave implicit time responses were sigmoidal, so we used two types of nonlinear mixed effect models for a-wave amplitude and implicit time, and b-wave implicit time. The data were fitted to a sigmoidal model with four parameters: upper and lower asymptotes, inflection point, and scale factor. For the b-wave amplitude, we used an asymptotic model with 3 parameters: asymptote, log of the rate constant, and light intensity offset. 4 parameter logistic function was used for the b-wave log implicit time as a function of log light intensity with parameters:1) A- asymptote as light intensity goes to infinity, 2) B- asymptote as light intensity goes to infinity, 3) Xmid- inflection point for light intensity, and 4) S- scale =&#x02009;difference between Xmid and light intensity where response is 75% of distance from A to B asymptotes. Larger S =&#x02009;shallower slope. Fixed effects were A, B, Xmid, and S for the left/naive eye and their differences with right eyes. Random effects (RE) were included for rats for Xmid (rat) and for eyes for B (eye). Fixed effects (FE) describe typical effect while REs describes rat/eye-specific effects.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec025" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0311392.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supporting Fig 1</label><caption><title>(SF1).
