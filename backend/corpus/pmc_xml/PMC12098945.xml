These make them suited to adoption in agriculture and today, about 70% of the calorie intake and 30% of protein for humans comes directly or indirectly from grasses. Key grass adaptations to open habitats include: morphology that allows meristems to avoid consumption and fire damage allowing regrowth; tissues rich in silica to resist herbivory and stress (<xref rid="vbaf079-B26" ref-type="bibr">Mitani-Ueno and Ma 2021</xref>); stomata that can respond faster than those of other plants to rapidly changing conditions of open habitats (<xref rid="vbaf079-B9090" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2017</xref>); cell walls containing ferulate implicated in lowering digestibility and stress resistance (<xref rid="vbaf079-B10" ref-type="bibr">Chandrakanth <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2024</xref>); unique inflorescence and seed characteristics for efficient reproduction (<xref rid="vbaf079-B21" ref-type="bibr">Kellogg 2001</xref>). These traits are the result of specific protein-coding genes, non-coding genes, and regulatory genomic elements that arose in the evolution of grasses; the pipeline described here is designed to identify the protein-coding genes (henceforth referred to as &#x0201c;genes&#x0201d; for brevity) involved in grass-specific traits.</p><p>Relatively few genes involved in these traits have been demonstrated experimentally but some key examples are listed in <xref rid="vbaf079-T1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>. It can be postulated that these grass genes and others responsible for functions specific to monocots/grasses that are key to grass fitness will be (1) present in all grasses, i.e. universal, (2) highly conserved, (3) have no close homologs in species outside monocots. The concept of universality of genes&#x02014;matching genes being present in all organisms within a taxonomic unit&#x02014;is a useful guide to their importance for fitness and implicitly groups genes by function (<xref rid="vbaf079-B22" ref-type="bibr">Kriventseva <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>). On point (3), it is convenient to consider monocot- and grass-specificity together because the large number of non-monocot plant genomes and wealth of gene knowledge (particularly for <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic>) make for a better reference set than the few, less studied non-grass monocot genomes. Also many key gene functions may have evolved first in monocots and then been expanded by gene duplication in grasses. Thus, the aim is to capture those genes with key functional innovations that arose in monocots or grasses and have not diverged further within the core grasses. <xref rid="vbaf079-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> shows a phylogenetic tree of monocots and grasses with estimates of divergence times from <xref rid="vbaf079-B43" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2024)</xref>.

</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>To find optimal grouping of grass genes into groups of universal genes requires several innovative steps, as major bioinformatic resources (e.g. Ensembl, Phytozome) group genes by evolutionary relationships, i.e. as orthologs or paralogs, making no attempt to identify which have diverged in function. Orthologs and paralogs are identified by most likely evolutionary path of mutation over whole sequence, whereas what matters for shared function is those elements in the encoded peptide that affect the function, identifiable in peptide sequences by high conservation (<xref rid="vbaf079-B9" ref-type="bibr">Capra and Singh 2007</xref>). Hidden Markov models (HMMs) which give greater weight to conserved sequence elements important for function have long been used as a highly effective means of comparing and functionally categorizing peptide sequences (<xref rid="vbaf079-B42" ref-type="bibr">Yoon 2009</xref>). Therefore, HMM match scores should be a better criterion for grouping universal genes of common function and for comparing other genes to these groups. To account for the greater likelihood of orthologs sharing function at a given level of sequence similarity (<xref rid="vbaf079-B18" ref-type="bibr">Gabald&#x000f3;n and Koonin 2013</xref>), orthologs should be selected rather than other genes with same HMM score; however paralogs can occasionally displace orthologs to perform same function so this possibility should ideally be allowed for in a pipeline.</p><p>Previous studies have identified lineage-specific genes, e.g. in <italic toggle="yes">Brassicaceae</italic> (<xref rid="vbaf079-B13" ref-type="bibr">Donoghue <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) or primates (<xref rid="vbaf079-B36" ref-type="bibr">Shao <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>) using cut-off scores from pairwise comparisons (by blastp or whole-genome alignments). These cut-off values are chosen conservatively so that the lineage-specific genes are highly likely to be new function, but the pipelines do not explicitly consider whether they have diverged in function within the lineage. The aim of the pipeline presented here is different as it is only concerned with universal genes of putative common function within the grasses. This allows a novel approach where a HMM profile can be built from all the genes within a universal group and used to search the non-grasses to judge specificity.</p><p>Using these principles a novel bioinformatics pipeline was designed which aims to: (a) identify a maximal set of groups of highly similar genes found in all grasses with each group having putative common function, (b) assign estimates of how specific these functions are to monocots/commelinid-/grass species based on closest hits from species outside these taxa.</p></sec><sec><title>2 Methods</title><sec><title>2.1 Selection of sequenced genomes</title><p>The Ensembl Plants database (<xref rid="vbaf079-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bolser <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2016</xref>) release 56 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://feb2023-plants.ensembl.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://feb2023-plants.ensembl.org/</ext-link>), which was used as the source of sequence and ortholog information, has fully sequenced genomes of grasses in four of the main taxa of core grasses (<xref rid="vbaf079-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). From these, 16 grass species of the most important crops (including rice, wheat, barley, <italic toggle="yes">Lolium</italic>, rye, sugar cane, sorghum, millet, maize) and models (<italic toggle="yes">Brachypodium distachyon</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Setaria viridis</italic>) were chosen for input to the pipeline with eight each from the BOP and PACMAD clades that together comprise the core grasses. Fifty-eight non-grass species genomes were also used for specificity steps in pipeline and details of all Ensembl genomes used are given in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. Whilst the highest-level BOP and PACMAD clades are represented in Ensembl Plants, there are no genomes from some major grass clades one level down (<xref rid="vbaf079-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>) which could lead to bias in identification of universal grass genes. To address this, two recently sequenced genomes of grasses within <italic toggle="yes">Bambusoideae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Arundinoideae</italic> clades available on NCBI were used in validation steps.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2 Pipeline overview</title><p>
<xref rid="vbaf079-F2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref> shows a scheme of the pipeline which takes input data downloaded from Ensembl Plants, processes these using custom software and public packages and generates datasets that populate a novel database called universal_grass_peps. The following input data were manually downloaded from the Ensembl Plants database: peptide sequences (peps) from gene models for 16 grass species and 58 non-grass species, the full genome sequences of the grasses with their gene annotations, and the ortholog tables of rice and maize gene models to all other grasses (downloaded using the Biomart tool).

First, some preparatory steps were needed to find all potential peps to be considered in the optimization and these were taken from the ortholog tables for the rice and maize reference species. Initially, groups were formed with one reference species entry and multiple candidate peps for other grass species.</p><p>Using peps from gene models of the 16 grass species, any identical ones were removed but all non-identical peps from splice variants were retained. The next step was to populate groups with the closest orthologs to each rice and maize pep. To reduce the complexity of this step, very similar maize and rice peps were collapsed into &#x0201c;clusters&#x0201d; defined as &#x0003e;90% identical in both directions of a pairwise comparison for all comparisons within a cluster. [Using blastp from BLAST+ package (<xref rid="vbaf079-B8" ref-type="bibr">Camacho <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) parameters: -evalue 1.e-5 -max_target_seqs 50 -seg no -max_hsps 1]. An ortholog table from the Ensembl multiple tables was then defined where each entry was defined by a primary key (group ID) of the rice peptide or peps cluster ID. Where there was no maize ortholog, the most similar maize pep was found with blastp and if this was not orthologous to another rice gene, added along with all the other grass genes orthologs of the maize gene to the group and group ID was set to composite of rice and maize seed cluster IDs. Groups from maize were also allowed where there was no rice ortholog or similar pep sequence (as this could be added by the later genBlastG step). Other grass species orthologs to rice and/or maize were assigned exclusively to a single group based on highest ranking by Ensembl ortholog confidence flag (0 or 1; defined from tree-compliance and, in a small number of cases, whole-genome alignment and gene order conservation; <ext-link xlink:href="https://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/compara/peptide_compara.html" ext-link-type="uri">https://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/compara/peptide_compara.html</ext-link>) then sequence similarity. Groups which had no entries for more than four of the 16 grasses were deleted and gene members orthologous to remaining groups were reassigned according to this ranking. At this stage (Box 1, <xref rid="vbaf079-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>) there were groups of multiple genes per grass all of which were classed orthologous to rice and/or maize. Using two reference species in this way allows for similar non-orthologous genes of potentially common function to be grouped together due to descending from two paralogs. But by using the ortholog information orthologous peps were more likely to be assigned to same group than non-orthologs with same level of similarity in accordance with the principle that orthologs are more likely to share function at a given level of sequence similarity (<xref rid="vbaf079-B18" ref-type="bibr">Gabald&#x000f3;n and Koonin 2013</xref>).</p><p>The next step (Box 2 in <xref rid="vbaf079-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>) was to optimize membership of groups keeping only one peptide sequence per species. This condition is required to meet the principle that each universal group represents a unique function required for fitness; it also makes the profile scores comparable across all groups and avoids biasing profile to species with many members in a group. HMM profiles of each group were initially generated using the top ranked pep sequence for each species. To make HMM profiles, all the group member peps were aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.1551 with default parameters (<xref rid="vbaf079-B15" ref-type="bibr">Edgar 2004</xref>) then the HMM profile was generated from this multiple alignment with hmmbuild (parameters&#x02014;amino&#x02014;fragthresh 0) and hmmpress commands from HMMER package version 3.3.2, November 2020 (<xref rid="vbaf079-B14" ref-type="bibr">Eddy 2022</xref>). Similarity scores of the member sequences against their own profile were obtained using hmmscan (all hmmscan steps in pipeline used parameter E 1.e-7, other parameters default). To compare across groups, this score was normalized to a maximum possible score obtained with the consensus sequence of the profile (generated by hmmemit command) to derive a HMM relative score (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>). Then group members were each substituted with all the alternative peptide sequences for this group and species; if <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> was improved by &#x0003e;0.01 the substitution was kept as the group member; this requirement means that peptide sequences ranked as best orthologs in previous step tended to be kept as group members. It was found that groups could be further improved by using grass Ensembl gene models hits to the HMM profile found with hmmscan that were not members of other groups; these are peps not found by previous steps probably because they were not in ortholog tables. Again, these peps were assigned as group members if they improved <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> by &#x0003e;0.01 (Box 3 in <xref rid="vbaf079-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p><p>In the next step (Box 4 in <xref rid="vbaf079-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>), the genBlastG tool was used (<xref rid="vbaf079-B37" ref-type="bibr">She <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) which searches for gene models with canonical splice junctions in genomic sequence using a query peptide sequence; here the consensus from HMM profile for the group was used as the query. For each group, and for each grass where the current member was missing or low scoring, the relevant grass genome was searched with genBlastG (v138, parameters -p genblastg -v 2 -h 0 -j 3 -r 1 -norepair). Any hits discovered by genBlastG were checked that they were novel by comparing exon coordinates with those of all Ensembl gene models using gff files. Using criteria as above, if a novel gene model from genBlastG improved the profile, it was adopted as the group member for that species and the HMM profile was rebuilt. A maximum of four genBlastG gene models were adopted so every profile has at least 12 Ensembl gene models. At the completion of this process, the <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> value was recalculated for each member and groups where the lowest scoring member had <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.65 or had missing members were discarded; the cut-off of 0.65 is a criterion for high conservation and the value was selected as that for which 90% of the expected universal non-specific genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>; see below) groups passed (see Section 4.2 for more on this parameter).</p><p>HMM profiles from the complete set of groups that pass these were compiled into a single HMMER database, the universal_grass_peps HMM database.</p></sec><sec><title>2.4 Comparison with use of OrthoFinder</title><p>OrthoFinder was assessed as an alternative source of ortholog information to input to the pipeline which has reportedly better performance in prediction of orthologs than Ensembl method (<xref rid="vbaf079-B16" ref-type="bibr">Emms and Kelly 2019</xref>).

However, correct gene models are frequently missing from annotated genomes particularly where there is no transcript information to support these as is often the case for lower expressed genes in less well studied species. Therefore, the genomic sequences were searched for gene models for each group and for each gene model that was missing or low scoring using the genBlastG tool with consensus peptide sequence of the group HMM profile as query (Box 4 in <xref rid="vbaf079-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). By incorporating the new gene models identified into groups the number of highly conserved universal groups was more than doubled from 6352 to 13&#x02009;312 showing the importance of the genBlastG step.

Most of these groups have no linked publications and only general descriptors and high-level GO terms based on domains. Of all the biological process GO annotations, most are assigned to at least one group suggesting there are some monocot-/commelinid-/grass-specific aspects of most processes in grasses. The processes that are dominated by these specific genes are shown by the terms which are enriched; there is clear enrichment of groups of regulatory proteins, especially those involved in control of transcription and of protein activity (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). Enriched molecular function GO terms are mostly DNA-binding and enzyme activities; the most enriched enzyme category is hydroxycinnamoyl transferase activity which may reflect the importance of these moities on lignin and xylan polymers in grass cell walls (<xref rid="vbaf079-B10" ref-type="bibr">Chandrakanth <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2023</xref>). The traits defined by TO terms in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S8</xref> are associated with variants of the member rice, maize, and/or wheat genes from evidence in the associated publications. Particularly common traits affected are grain size (70 groups), flowering time (50 groups), with numerous morphology traits as might be expected. However also common are traits for insect/pathogen defence and abiotic stress resistance.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>4 Discussion</title><p>Genes of common function that occur in all species within a taxonomic unit (universality) indicate that the function is likely key to fitness. Although sequence similarity is a measure of likelihood of shared function, using existing bioinformatic resources it is not straightforward to compare genes in a systematic way, nor to check for criterion of universality given variation in completeness of genome annotation. The new approach described here provides predictions of all universal grass genes with putative common function and estimates of their specificity to monocots/commelinids/grasses. The requirement for universality led to the incorporation of the genBlastG step to find missing genes (Box 4 in <xref rid="vbaf079-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>); this step generated 14&#x02009;921 new gene models. The fact that 76% of the rice genBlastG gene models were found in the high-quality IC4R rice genome (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S5</xref>) suggests most of these new gene models are not pseudogenes and that future grass RNAseq studies will validate them. The use of a metric based on HMM profile score to estimate how specific the function of a universal group is to monocot/commelinid/grass species is another novel aspect of the pipeline; it provides a systematic basis for an assertion of such specificity for genes of unknown function.</p><sec><title>4.1 Importance of monocot-/commelinid-/grass-specific genes</title><p>Grasses typically have a haploid set of about 40&#x02009;000 protein-coding genes. The analysis here indicates that about 13&#x02009;000 of these are universal in grasses and that about a third of universal genes are monocot-/commelinid-/grass-specific. All of the known function specific genes (<xref rid="vbaf079-T1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>) are in the specific set of 4609 genes in universal_grass_peps (except Lsi6) so the set likely includes other genes involved in these known monocot-/commelinid-/grass-specific traits (stomata, cell walls, Si deposition, etc) and any linked literature is listed in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S8</xref>. An analysis of GO terms (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S9</xref>) suggests many more biological processes, in fact almost all GO biological process terms, involve some genes which are monocot-/commelinid-/grass-specific. The specific genes are particularly enriched for regulatory functions as might be expected given the radically different organization and morphology of grasses.</p><p>The importance of variants of the monocot-/commelinid-/grass-specific genes for crop traits is seen from publications associated to the identified sets (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S8</xref>) including numerous variants associated with grain yield, abiotic stress and defence. Where a trait is known to be commelinid- or grass-specific, the classifications generated here can help to identify candidate genes involved in the trait. In our own work on dietary fibre QTLs in wheat grain, candidate genes identified as likely commelinid-/grass-specific were prioritized as dietary fibre is mostly feruloylated arabinoxylan (AX) that only occurs in commelinid species. The causal allele was eventually shown to be a variant of one such gene&#x02014;a commelind-specific peroxidase involved in cross-linking AX (<xref rid="vbaf079-B27" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>4.2 Limitations of approach</title><p>All high-throughput predictions of shared function based almost entirely on peptide sequence need to be used with caution and cannot substitute for detailed knowledge of the particular protein. A major problem for any pipeline trying to find universal genes is the large variation in sequence conservation of proteins of same function, e.g. different subunits of cytochrome c oxidase showed conservation varying from 16% to 64% in comparison of yeast and animal sequences (<xref rid="vbaf079-B12" ref-type="bibr">Das <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Use of HMMs rather than whole-sequence similarity helps as non-conserved regions contribute less to score but even the HMM derived <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> score showed considerable variation in the curated non-specific gene set. The cut-off of 0.65 which 90% of this set passed was chosen to be inclusive so that nearly all true universal genes will be found but this low threshold does mean that there will also likely be &#x0201c;universal&#x0201d; groups containing genes with similar but non-identical functions.</p><p>The approach here should therefore be treated as a first best guess of shared function similar to comparing percentage identity (as biologists often do as a first step) but more likely to be accurate (as evidenced by the better discrimination between the specific and non-specific function sets; <xref rid="vbaf079-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>) as the HMM approach weights the conserved parts of sequence important for function, exploiting the fact that the identified genes are highly conserved and present in all grasses. As stated above, the universal gene groups would be expected to include nearly all cases of genes which have identical function in all grasses, but they can also include cases where there are highly similar functions with divergent aspects. Therefore, the next step after identifying a group of interest should be to inspect the multiple alignment (as in <xref rid="vbaf079-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) to judge the extent of divergence in different grasses; all 13&#x02009;312 multiple sequence alignment files are available in the universal_grass_peps database.</p><p>Inspection of these multiple alignments can also highlight outlier sequences (as in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) which may be due to incorrect gene models. The criterion of universality does make this pipeline highly dependent on the quality of the grass genome assemblies and their annotation. Better genome quality and annotation will help to check and improve universal_grass_peps as shown by use of rice IC4R genome (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>4.3 Uses of universal_grass_peps database</title><p>Where experiments reveal large sets of grass genes or peps such as transcriptomics, proteomics, or genes underlying QTLs, they are inevitably dominated by genes with little or no information on function. Even for rice, the most studied grass, only 13% of genes in RAP-DB database (<xref rid="vbaf079-B30" ref-type="bibr">Sakai <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) have associated publications and only a minority of these publications specify function. For such unknown genes it is useful to have a systematic approach to identifying those that are of grass-/commelinid-/monocot-specific function as this information can point to the nature of the process they are likely involved in. For example a network of co-regulated genes identified from transcriptomics enriched for grass-specific functions indicates involvement of the network in a grass-specific trait such as inflorescence development, Si deposition etc. Using the look-up tables available in universal_grass_peps, any set of grass genes from the grass genomes used here can be used to find all those in, or associated to, the universal groups. For each group identified, the values of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic> metrics as measures of specificity are given along with resulting categorization as likely non-specific, monocot-, commelinid-, or grass-specific providing some evidence on role of gene.</p></sec><sec><title>4.4 Future developments</title><p>The pipeline reported here is a first attempt to implement the concept of using universal genes to identify groups of putative common function and likely specificity but could be improved upon in future. Improvements might be made by using recently released alternative packages for finding gene models in genomes such as miniprot (<xref rid="vbaf079-B23" ref-type="bibr">Li 2023</xref>) (to replace genBlastG for Box 4 in <xref rid="vbaf079-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>) with reportedly better performance. The validation steps here show that future updates with more diverse and better-quality grass genomes will improve universal_grass_peps. Further in the future, whilst HMMs are a convenient and fast way of obtaining profiles for groups, they are actually a proxy for comparison of structures; potentially a better approach would be direct comparison of predicted structures such as that generated by AlphaFold although such a capability is not currently available.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>vbaf079_Supplementary_Data</label><media xlink:href="vbaf079_supplementary_data.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The author thanks Keywan Hassani-Pak, head of bioinformatics at Rothamsted Research, for useful discussions and providing KnetMiner data, and Melina Velasquez for assistance with data repository.</p></ack><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>Rowan A.C.
