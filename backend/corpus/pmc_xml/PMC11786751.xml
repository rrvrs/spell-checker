However, combining ATP-site and allosteric kinase inhibitors can overcome these shortcomings in a double-drugging framework. Here we explored the allosteric effects of two pyrimidine diamines, PDA1 and PDA2, on the conformational dynamics and activity of the Src-family tyrosine kinase Hck, a promising drug target for acute myeloid leukemia. Using <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR, we mapped the binding site for both analogs to the SH3 domain. Despite the shared binding site, PDA1 and PDA2 had opposing effects on near-full-length Hck dynamics by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, with PDA1 stabilizing and PDA2 disrupting the overall kinase conformation. Kinase activity assays were consistent with these observations, with PDA2 enhancing kinase activity while PDA1 was without effect. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted selective bridging of the kinase domain N-lobe and SH3 domain by PDA1, a mechanism of allosteric stabilization supported by site-directed mutagenesis of N-lobe contact sites. Cellular thermal shift assays confirmed SH3 domain&#x02013;dependent interaction of PDA1 with WT Hck in myeloid leukemia cells and with a kinase domain gatekeeper mutant (T338M). These results identify PDA1 as a starting point for Src-family kinase allosteric inhibitor development that may work in concert with ATP-site inhibitors to suppress the evolution of resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Src-family kinase</kwd><kwd>tyrosine kinases</kwd><kwd>kinase inhibitors</kwd><kwd>SH3 domain</kwd><kwd>SH2 domain</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term id="kwrd0050">AML</term><def><p>acute myeloid leukemia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0060">BME</term><def><p>&#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0070">CML</term><def><p>chronic myeloid leukemia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0080">CSP</term><def><p>chemical shift perturbation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd00853">DMSO</term><def><p>dimethyl sulfoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0090">HDX-MS</term><def><p>hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0100">MD</term><def><p>molecular dynamics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0110">PDA</term><def><p>pyrimidine diamine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0120">PPII</term><def><p>polyproline type-II</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0130">SEC</term><def><p>size- exclusion chromatography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0140">SFK</term><def><p>Src family kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0150">SH</term><def><p>Src homology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0160">SPR</term><def><p>surface plasmon resonance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0170">TKI</term><def><p>tyrosine kinase inhibitor</p></def></def-item></def-list><notes><p id="misc0010">Reviewed by members of the JBC Editorial Board.

Cole</p></notes></front><body><p id="p0010">Nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases are diverse signaling molecules which affect a multitude of cellular processes in both normal and disease states. These enzymes share a well-conserved, bilobed kinase domain which transfers the &#x003b3;-phosphate group from ATP onto select tyrosine residues of substrate proteins. The kinase active site is located at the interface of the two lobes and includes the flexible activation loop. While the kinase domain and ATP-binding site are highly conserved, the proteins have diverse regulatory domains N- or C-terminal to the kinase domain which can influence many kinase properties including dynamics, activity, localization, and substrate specificity (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">Some of the best characterized examples of allosteric tyrosine kinase regulation come from the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (SFKs). There are eight mammalian SFKs: Src, Yes, Fyn, Hck, Lyn, Fgr, Lck, and Blk which can be separated into two four-member subfamilies (A and B) based on sequence similarity. Several family members, such as Yes and Src, are expressed in almost all cell types. Others exhibit lineage-specific expression patterns, such as Hck, which is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells. In addition to the kinase domain, all SFKs have Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains, which are coupled by a short flexible connector. Other regulatory elements include the N-terminal SH4 myristoylation signal sequence, which is important for peripheral membrane localization, an unstructured unique region, the SH2-kinase domain linker, and a C-terminal tail (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">SFK activation is tightly controlled by intramolecular interactions as well as the phosphorylation state of the protein. In the inactive state, the SH3 domain binds to a polyproline type-II (PPII) helix formed by the SH2-kinase linker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>A</italic>) while the SH2 domain engages the C-terminal tail, which is phosphorylated by a separate regulatory kinase known as Csk (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). These interactions push the SH3-SH2 unit against the back of the kinase domain, allosterically stabilizing a closed, inactive conformation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>A</italic>). Interactions with ligands that perturb these interactions as well as dephosphorylation of the regulatory tail phosphotyrosine, pTyr527 (amino acid numbering based on the crystal structure of human Src; PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/2SRC" id="intref0010">2SRC</ext-link>) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), cause the protein to become activated. Full kinase activation also involves autophosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine (pTyr416). This phosphorylation event creates a steric and electrostatic barrier that prevents the activation loop from adopting a partially folded, inactive conformation. Additional amino acids, such as Trp260, affect these regulatory events which are not mutually exclusive and the formation of one activating or inactivating interaction can propagate to others (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). SFKs can also adopt alternative active forms in which either the SH3 or SH2 domains are displaced from their regulatory interactions (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In addition to regulating kinase activity, the noncatalytic regions modulate signal transduction by interacting with SH3- and SH2-binding motifs in other proteins to regulate substrate selection and subcellular localization. Less is known about the functions of the unique domains, which vary in length and sequence between family members. NMR studies suggest that the unique region may interact with the SH3 domain to regulate kinase activity as well as substrate selection (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p><bold>Crystal structure of near-full-length Hck and chemical structures of pyrimidine diamine allosteric modulators.</bold><italic>A</italic>, crystal structure of Hck bound to the ATP-site inhibitor, A-419259 (A-419; <italic>cyan</italic>).

The fusion protein Bcr-Abl, which results from the Philadelphia chromosome translocation, is the oncogenic tyrosine kinase driver of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The Abl portion of Bcr-Abl is a tyrosine kinase that is structurally related to the SFKs, with an SH3-SH2-kinase core followed by a long C-terminal region (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The N-terminal 70 amino acids of Bcr form a coiled-coil domain which induces oligomerization and constitutive activation of Abl in this fusion protein (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Imatinib, a selective Abl kinase inhibitor, received FDA approval for use in CML in 2001 and inspired a new generation of kinase-directed drug discovery (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). At the beginning of 2024, 80 small molecule kinase inhibitors had received FDA approval, 63 of which inhibit tyrosine kinases including SFKs (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">Because SFKs normally control cellular growth, differentiation, adhesion, and motility, dysregulation of SFK activity contributes to many forms of cancer (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Of note, the myeloid cell-specific SFKs, Fgr, Hck, and Lyn, are associated with both CML and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML is the most common form of blood cancer in adults with approximately 20,000 new cases and 11,000 deaths in the United States each year (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). High-level expression of Fgr, Hck, or Lyn correlates with poor prognoses for AML patients (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Hck specifically is overexpressed in leukemia stem cells compared to healthy hematopoietic stem cells, making it a particularly attractive target for inhibitor discovery (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Several preclinical ATP-site inhibitors with nM activity against Hck have been described, including the pyrrolopyrimidine A-419259 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and the N-phenylbenzamide TL02-59 (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Both compounds block the growth of AML cells that overexpress these kinases in experiments with cell lines, patient bone marrow cells, and mouse models of the disease (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">Despite the promise of ATP-site tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in cancer, off-target activity and acquired resistance remain important clinical limitations. Most clinical TKIs target the ATP-binding site which is highly conserved across different protein tyrosine kinase families. While some degree of selectivity can be achieved by targeting unique sites adjacent to the ATP-binding pocket, off-target binding can still lead to significant side effects. Additionally, a single point mutation in the drug-binding site is often sufficient to cause loss of inhibitor activity. A common example involves the so-called &#x02018;gatekeeper&#x02019; residue (Thr315 in Abl, Thr338 in c-Src), which when mutated can cause resistance for many TKIs including imatinib (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) while also increasing kinase activity (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). As a result, recent TKI discovery has focused on allosteric inhibitors which target sites adjacent to the ATP-binding site or more distant pockets and have the potential to work in combination with ATP-site inhibitors (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">To overcome the issue of acquired resistance, a &#x0201c;double-drugging&#x0201d; approach has emerged which involves the simultaneous use of two inhibitors for the same kinase which have mutually exclusive resistance mechanisms. Wylie <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) demonstrated this concept for CML by combining the FDA-approved Abl inhibitors nilotinib, which binds the ATP-site, and asciminib, which targets a unique myristoyl-binding pocket in the C-lobe of the Abl kinase domain. When used separately, both inhibitors initially suppressed CML cell growth in a mouse model, followed by relapse presumably due to acquired resistance mutations within the drug-binding site. However, administration of the two-drug combination resulted in a durable response, with no tumor regrowth even after dosing was stopped. In a related study, Kim <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) showed that these two inhibitors increase each other&#x02019;s affinity when they have the same conformational preferences. This &#x0201c;double drugging framework&#x0201d; occurs because binding of one inhibitor shifts the conformational landscape of the kinase domain to favor the preferred conformation of the second inhibitor, thereby decreasing the thermodynamic barrier for binding. In practice, this approach has the potential of increasing the specificity of the inhibitor combination by increasing the difference between their on- <italic>versus</italic> off-target affinities.</p><p id="p0045">In the present study, we evaluated the binding mechanism and conformational influence of two small molecules that interact with the regulatory SH3-SH2-linker region of the myeloid SFK, Hck. These compounds, PDA1 and PDA2, share a pyrimidine diamine scaffold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>B</italic>) and are shown here to bind to the PPII helix-interacting site of the Hck SH3 domain by <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR. Despite the shared binding site, these compounds have opposing effects on the overall kinase conformation as shown by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and site-directed mutagenesis suggest that PDA1, which stabilizes kinase dynamics, bridges the SH3 domain and the N-lobe of the kinase domain, allowing the compound to stabilize a closed, downregulated conformation. PDA2, on the other hand, destabilizes the overall kinase conformation and stimulates kinase activity <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>. Using a cellular thermal shift assay, which provides information on overall protein stability in cells, we demonstrate that PDA1 interacts with Hck in myeloid leukemia cells including a gatekeeper mutant which confers resistance to the ATP site inhibitor, A-419259. Conversely, an SH3 mutant of Hck that does not bind PDA1 (W118A) retains binding to the orthosteric inhibitor, A-419259. Development of PDA1 analogs with improved potency for interdomain bridging and cellular activity represents a promising path forward for allosteric inhibitors of Hck and other SFKs. These inhibitors may have therapeutic efficacy by themselves or as part of a combination therapy with ATP-site inhibitors in a double-drugging framework for AML cases where Hck is overexpressed.</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Determination of PDA-binding site on the SH3 domain of Hck by HSQC NMR</title><p id="p0050">We previously reported the identification of small molecules that bind to the noncatalytic SH3-SH2-linker region of Hck (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This effort identified a cluster of small molecules that share a common pyrimidine diamine (PDA) core from a fluorescence polarization-based screen of 60,000 diverse compounds. Each of these compounds bound to the Hck regulatory region with micromolar potency by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). To begin to define the binding site and mechanism of action, we first resynthesized two of the compounds (PDA1 and PDA2) and confirmed their structures by NMR and LC-MS (synthetic routes and analytical data are provided in the <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supporting information</xref>).</p><p id="p0055">To experimentally determine the binding site of the PDA compounds within the Hck regulatory region, an <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Hck SH3-SH2-linker (Hck-32L) protein was prepared for analysis by <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR. Previous NMR studies of a similar Hck-32L protein identified backbone amide N-H resonances (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), which enabled identification of spectral changes in response to PDA binding. Both PDA1 and PDA2 induced concentration-dependent chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) in resonances which correlate to the backbone amides of SH3 residues including Glu93, Trp118, Trp119, Leu124, and Ile132. Other CSPs were associated with SH3-SH2 connector residues Thr145 and Phe150 as well as Glu255 in the SH2-kinase linker (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>).

CSPs induced by PDA binding observed in the SH3 domain include E93, W118, I132. PDA1 shows more pronounced CSPs of amides, compared to PDA2, in the connector between SH3 and SH2 (E144 and T145) and W254 and E255 in the SH2-kinase linker.

Both PDA1 and PDA2 induced large CSPs of the indole N-H resonance of Trp118. Previous studies have shown that Trp118 is essential for Hck SH3-binding activity both <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and in cells (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Neither compound strongly affected the indole N-H resonance of adjacent Trp119. In crystal structures of Hck, the Trp118 side chain forms part of a surface that interacts with the PPII helix in the linker, while the Trp119 side chain faces the hydrophobic core of the domain (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This suggests that the PDA compounds may bind near Trp118 in the PPII helix interaction site. To unambiguously assign the Trp118 indole N-H resonance, HSQC NMR experiments were repeated with an Hck-32L-W118A mutant protein. Spectra with this mutant showed loss of the Trp118 signal as well as other CSPs associated with binding (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</xref>). Finally, PDA1 but not PDA2 induced a CSP in Trp254 in the linker, providing evidence that each ligand has a unique effect on the overall conformation of the regulatory region. Because there are two tryptophan residues in the linker (Trp254 and Trp259), the PDA-induced Trp254 indole resonance was unambiguously assigned with an Hck-32L-W254A mutant (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S3</xref><italic>A</italic>).

To determine whether NMR can detect PDA binding to the SH3 domain alone, <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Hck SH3 protein was produced, and <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra were recorded in the presence and absence of each PDA compound.

The average overall sequence identity of Hck to all other family members was 63.2% with an SD of 4.8% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>A</italic>). We then calculated the identity for the individual SH3, SH2, and kinase domains as well as the ATP-binding sites. Not surprisingly, the kinase domains and ATP-binding sites showed the highest conservation with Hck (72.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5.9% and 83.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5.9% identity, respectively). Interestingly, every single kinase domain and ATP-binding site sequence showed higher conservation to those in Hck compared to the full-length protein, supporting evolutionary pressure against mutations in this region. The opposite trend was observed for the SH3 domains, which were the least conserved domains overall compared to Hck (56.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.5% identity with Hck SH3), and each SFK has higher overall sequence identity to Hck than the SH3 domains have to one another. For the SH2 domains, two were less conserved, three were more conserved, and two were about the same, with 56.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.5% average identity with Hck.<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence identity among SFK domains and binding selectivity of PDAs to Hck, Src, and Lyn.</bold><italic>A</italic>, violin plot showing distribution of sequence identities among Src family members and their domains relative to Hck.

To define this region, we chose SH3 residues within 5&#x000a0;&#x000c5; of the polyproline helix of the linker in a closed structure of Hck (PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/9BYJ" id="intref0015">9BYJ</ext-link>) (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These include Y90, D91, I95, H96, E117, W118, Y131, P133, N135, and Y136. These residues were then compared to residues in the analogous positions in the SH3 domains of the other SFKs. The Hck SH3-binding surface shows a similar degree of conservation as the overall kinases (63.2% <italic>versus</italic> 64.3%) but lower conservation than the kinase domains (72.6%) and the ATP-binding site (83.96%). Thus, enough sequence diversity may be present to create PDA analogs with increased isoform selectivity.</p><p id="p0080">We next explored the binding of PDA compounds to other members of the Src kinase family to investigate whether sequence differences in the SH3 domains might influence PDA-binding selectivity. For these experiments, we chose Lyn, in which the SH3 domain is most closely related to Hck, and Src, which is more distantly related (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>A</italic>). These kinases also represent members of the two SFK subfamilies, type A (Src) and type B (Lyn and Hck). Interaction kinetics were assessed by SPR using recombinant near-full-length Hck, Lyn, and Src. All three recombinant proteins lack the N-terminal unique domain, are phosphorylated on their C-terminal tail by co-expression of Csk, and dephosphorylated on the A-loop by co-expression of the PTP1B catalytic domain. As a result, each kinase adopts the closed conformation. In all cases, the PDA compounds showed the highest affinity for Hck. For PDA1, the K<sub>D</sub> value for Src (55.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.18&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) was slightly higher than for Hck (42.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.88&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M), while with Lyn, PDA1 showed a K<sub>D</sub> value (74.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;19.9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) nearly twice that of Hck (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>B</italic>). The replacement of Hck Glu93 and Glu255, both of which showed significant CSPs by NMR, with shorter aspartate side chains in Lyn may impact the binding of PDA1 despite charge conservation. With PDA2, both Lyn and Src showed higher K<sub>D</sub> values (180&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;33.7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M and 236&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;18.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, respectively) than Hck (110&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;24.7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M). While the differences in the K<sub>D</sub> values among the kinases tested is modest, it is important to emphasize that these differences were observed with hit compounds from a previous screen (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) that have not undergone medicinal chemistry optimization. Analysis of sequence conservation in the SH3-binding surface described above suggests that structure-based design may ultimately yield analogs with improved selectivity and specificity. That said, some cross-over in selectivity within the Src family may be of benefit, because multiple Src family members have been implicated in the etiology of AML. In addition to Hck, these include Fgr, Fyn, and Lyn (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>PDA1 and PDA2 have opposite effects on Hck conformational dynamics and kinase activity</title><p id="p0085">Previous studies have shown that peptide and protein ligands for the Hck SH3 domain stimulate kinase activity both <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and in cells (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). These observations support a mechanism by which SH3 domain displacement leads to allosteric activation of the kinase domain. Because the PDA compounds bind to the SH3 domain, we explored their impact on Hck conformational dynamics by HDX-MS. The first series of experiments involved the Hck-U32L protein, which lacks the kinase domain and C-terminal tail but retains the N-terminal unique domain. Hck-U32L was preincubated in the presence or absence of each PDA analog followed by exposure to D<sub>2</sub>O-based buffer to induce deuterium exchange for various times ranging from 10&#x000a0;s to 4&#x000a0;h. Following exchange, deuterium uptake into peptic peptides derived from the protein was determined by LC-MS/MS. Overall results are presented as difference heat maps in terms of protection from (reduced HDX, blue) or exposure to (increased HDX, green) deuterium uptake as a function of D<sub>2</sub>O exposure time in the presence or absence of the compound (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). Incubation with either PDA1 or PDA2 caused an overall decrease in HDX for peptides derived from the SH3 domain, including peptides with residues exhibiting significant CSPs in the NMR studies. These include peptide 109 to 135, which contains Trp118 that was identified as a key interaction point by mutagenesis (individual deuterium uptake curves for this peptide are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref><italic>A</italic>). This observation supports the conclusion that PDA1 and PDA2 occupy overlapping binding sites in the SH3 domain and is consistent with the NMR results. PDA1 also induced rapid and sustained protection of the unique region, as well as the SH2 domain and the SH2-kinase linker (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>, <italic>B&#x02013;D</italic>). By contrast, PDA2 had no allosteric influence on deuterium uptake by the unique, SH2, and linker regions, despite the shared binding site with PDA1. These results suggest that PDA1 acts as an allosteric stabilizer of the Hck regulatory region, an unexpected result given the binding site of the compound.<fig id="fig4"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p><bold>HDX-MS difference maps for Hck-U32L protein in the presence of PDA1 and PDA2.</bold> Hck-U32L protein was equilibrated in the presence and absence of PDA1 and PDA2, followed by exposure to D<sub>2</sub>O-based buffer for the timepoints shown.

Overall, PDA1 increased protection from deuterium exchange across diverse regions of the protein, including the SH3 and SH2 domains, the SH3-SH2 domain connector, and the kinase domain C-lobe. One exception is the SH2-kinase linker. While several peptides from this region showed an increase in deuterium uptake at earlier time points (10&#x000a0;s, 1, and 10&#x000a0;min) relative to the apo protein, they ultimately did not reach the same level of incorporation by the 4-h time point. Deuterium uptake plots for linker peptide 243 to 267 illustrate this effect (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref><italic>B</italic>). This observation is consistent with small molecule binding at the SH3 domain affecting the linker conformation or by directly inhibiting deuterium exchange through steric effects. In addition, a few peptides derived from the kinase domain N-lobe showed a modest increase in deuterium uptake at the longest time points tested (1 and 4&#x000a0;h); uptake curves with peptide 281 to 300 provide an example (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref><italic>C</italic>).<fig id="fig6"><label>Figure&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p><bold>PDA1 and PDA2 have opposing effects on Hck dynamics and kinase activity.</bold> Recombinant near-full-length Hck was equilibrated with PDA1 or PDA2 or left untreated followed by HDX-MS analysis.

PDA2 also induced changes in the SH2-kinase linker consistent with displacement from the SH3 domain and to a greater degree than PDA1 (peptide 243&#x02013;267; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref><italic>B</italic>).

Overall, these changes in HDX suggest that PDA2 destabilizes and shifts Hck away from the closed conformation.</p><p id="p0100">Because the Hck SH3 and SH2 domains allosterically regulate kinase activity, the results of the HDX-MS experiments predict that PDA1 may be an inhibitor of kinase activity while PDA2 may be an activator. To test this idea, we performed kinetic kinase activity assays with near-full-length Hck, the same recombinant kinase protein used in the HDX-MS studies. Kinase reactions were run over a wide range of PDA concentrations, and steady state reaction velocities were calculated by regression analysis of the linear part of each progress curve. Consistent with the HDX-MS results, PDA2 stimulated Hck activity in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref><italic>E</italic>). PDA1, however, had no significant effect on substrate peptide phosphorylation by Hck in this assay over the same range of concentrations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref><italic>E</italic>). In some experimental replicates, however, we observed concentration-dependent inhibition of Hck activity by PDA1 with micromolar IC<sub>50</sub> values in line with those observed for PDA1 binding by SPR (data not shown). The low affinity of PDA1 for Hck as well as possible heterogeneity in the starting conformation of the kinase may account for the inconsistency in these results.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>MD simulations predict distinct interactions for PDA1 <italic>versus</italic> PDA2</title><p id="p0105">To investigate how PDA1 and PDA2 share a binding site yet have opposite effects on Hck dynamics and kinase activity, we performed MD simulations.

However, their respective pyrimidine diamine scaffolds are orthogonally inverted relative to one another with different binding modes. PDA1 forms a series of interactions that bridge the SH3 domain and the N-lobe of the kinase domain, involving N-lobe residues His289 and Thr290. The difluorophenyl ring of PDA1 inserts between the side chains of His96 in the SH3 domain RT loop and Trp118 to form an &#x02018;aromatic sandwich&#x02019;. Additional contacts are present with SH3 residues Tyr92 and Tyr136. Binding of PDA2, on the other hand, required restructuring of the SH3 domain RT-loop. The positions of both small molecules adjacent to the binding surface of the SH3 domain suggest that they must displace the SH2-kinase linker, which has been previously associated with kinase activation as described above. However, only PDA2 induces kinase activation, suggesting that PDA1-mediated bridging of the SH3 domain and the N-lobe may compensate for linker displacement, resulting in the observed stabilization of the overall structure by HDX-MS and lack of kinase activation.<fig id="fig7"><label>Figure&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p><bold>Molecular dynamics simulations of PDA ligand binding to near-full-length Hck and verification of the binding site by kinetic kinase assay.</bold> PDA1 and PDA2 were docked with the crystal structure of near-full-length Hck followed by 600&#x000a0;ns MD simulations as described under Experimental procedures.

The baseline activity of Hck-HTA was somewhat higher than WT, which may reflect loss of stabilizing contacts between the N-lobe and the linker (<italic>e.g.</italic>, hydrogen bonding of Thr290 with Lys252 in the linker), though this mutation does not induce full activation of the kinase.

Consequently, the cells become susceptible to ATP-site Hck inhibitors such as A-419259. Cells expressing WT Hck, on the other hand, still require GM-CSF and remain insensitive to this inhibitor.

Unlike PDA1, PDA2 showed very low potency against all TF-1&#x000a0;cell populations, with IC<sub>50</sub> values&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;190&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S7</xref><italic>B</italic>).</p><p id="p0140">To confirm that PDA1 interacts directly with Hck in TF-1&#x000a0;cells, we used a cellular thermal shift assay. In this assay, interaction of a ligand with a target protein often affects its thermal stability making it either more or less aggregation prone at higher temperatures. For this experiment, we used populations of TF-1&#x000a0;cells expressing either WT Hck, Hck-W118A, or Hck-T338M without the coiled-coil fusion. Each cell population was incubated with the PDA analogs, A-419259 as a positive control, or 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control) for 1&#x000a0;h. Cell aliquots were then incubated at either 35 &#x000b0;C or 47.5 &#x000b0;C for 2&#x000a0;min and the amount of protein in the soluble fraction was quantified by immunoblotting for Hck with actin as a loading control. The results are presented as the difference in the percent stability of Hck in the presence of each compound compared to the DMSO control (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;8</xref><italic>D</italic>).</p><p id="p0145">A-419259 treatment increased the thermal stability of both WT Hck and the SH3-W118A mutant but had no effect on Hck-T338M which does not bind A-419259. In contrast to A-419259, PDA1 treatment decreased the stability of both WT Hck and the T338M mutant. However, this effect was lost with the W118A mutant, which does not bind PDA1 <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>. These results provide direct evidence that PDA1 enters cells and interacts with Hck in an SH3 domain-dependent manner and are consistent with the role of Trp118 in binding as observed by NMR. Finally, PDA2 treatment had a small negative effect on Hck stability in all three cell lines. This result suggests that PDA2 may show low cell penetration, which is consistent with its relatively low cytotoxicity than PDA1 (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S7</xref>). Alternatively, PDA2 may not have a significant impact on the thermal stability of Hck in cells, precluding a readout in this assay.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0150">In a previous study, we identified a series of pyrimidine diamines that bind to the regulatory domains of Hck (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), a Src-family kinase expressed in myeloid hematopoietic cells and potential target for AML therapy (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Here we demonstrate that two of these compounds, PDA1 and PDA2, share a binding site on the Hck SH3 domain. Surprisingly, these analogs have opposing actions on the overall conformation of Hck in solution despite the shared SH3 domain&#x02013;binding site. MD simulations combined with site-directed mutagenesis strongly suggest that this difference is due to alternative binding modes, with PDA1 stabilizing and PDA2 perturbing the SH3-linker&#x02013;N-lobe interactions required for kinase regulation.</p><p id="p0155">We identified the binding site of PDA1 and PDA2 on the Hck SH3 domain by <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR and HDX-MS. Both compounds occupy the PPII helix-interacting site on the SH3 domain centered around Trp118. SPR experiments reported during the initial discovery of these compounds suggested that they could not bind the SH3 domain alone (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). However, the NMR results presented here indicate that the SH3 domain is sufficient for ligand binding. The lack of binding previously reported may have been the result of low SH3 domain immobilization, suboptimal orientation following covalent attachment of SH3 to the SPR biosensor, or the flow-based nature of SPR. Despite a shared SH3 domain&#x02013;binding site, PDA1 and PDA2 have opposing effects on overall Hck conformational dynamics by HDX-MS. PDA1 induced overall stabilization of a Hck protein consisting of the unique, SH3, SH2, and linker regions (U32L) as well as near-full-length Hck, as reflected in reduced deuterium uptake by most peptides derived from these proteins. Interestingly, binding of PDA1 to SH3 reduced deuterium update in the unique domain of the U32L protein, suggesting that these domains interact as shown by previous NMR studies (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In contrast, PDA2 disrupted the overall kinase conformation, increasing deuterium uptake in most peptides including several at a distance from the SH3-binding site. These results are consistent with kinase activity assays, where PDA2 induced kinase activation while PDA1 was without effect.</p><p id="p0160">Both PDA1 and PDA2 protected SH3 domain peptides in the truncated U32L protein from deuterium exchange, consistent with SH3 as the binding site for both compounds (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref><italic>A</italic>). However, SH3 peptides from near-full-length Hck did not show protection from exchange with either PDA1 or PDA2 (<italic>e.g.</italic> SH3 peptide 109&#x02013;135; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref><italic>D</italic>). In the apo state of the near-full-length protein, the SH3 domain is bound to the SH2-kinase linker and therefore protected from exchange. Binding of either ligand to the SH3 domain displaces the linker but maintains protection of SH3 from deuterium uptake due to the shared binding site. As a result, there is little net difference in exchange for the SH3 domain in the context of near-full-length Hck. A similar result was observed following HDX-MS analysis of Hck in complex with the HIV-1 Nef protein, which also binds to the SH3 domain to activate the kinase <italic>via</italic> linker displacement (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In this case, the SH3 domain is either bound to the linker or to Nef and is protected from deuterium uptake in either case (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Previous HDX-MS studies of an Hck SH3-SH2-linker protein have also shown that the SH3 domain does not engage the linker in the absence of the kinase domain (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Thus, PDA ligand binding results in protection of the SH3 domain from deuterium uptake in the U32L protein because it is not bound to the linker (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref><italic>A</italic>).</p><p id="p0165">Previous work has shown autophosphorylated Hck can be stimulated further by SH3 domain displacement under identical assay conditions (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), indicating that autophosphorylation alone does not cause full kinase activation. This effect was shown again in the present study with the activation of Hck by PDA2. Unlike PDA2, PDA1 did not stimulate kinase activity <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>, which was surprising given previous reports that proteins or peptides that bind to the Hck SH3 domain result in kinase activation as observed with PDA2 (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). MD simulations and HDX-MS suggest that PDA1 stabilizes the closed state of Hck by bridging residues in the SH3 domain with kinase domain N-lobe residues His289 and Thr290. Mutagenesis of these N-lobe residues to alanines increased basal kinase activity and rendered Hck susceptible to activation by PDA1. While PDA1 binding appears to maintain the closed conformation of the overall kinase based on the HDX data, it did not suppress kinase activity. However, future analogs of PDA1 with higher affinity may show direct inhibitory potential. Regardless, selective SH3-binders such as PDA1 may represent useful drug leads by preventing SH3-dependent substrate recruitment to disrupt oncogenic signaling. Consistent with this idea, an Hck SH3 domain mutant showed reduced oncogenic activity in rodent fibroblasts due in part to reduced recruitment and activation of the Stat3 transcription factor (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p id="p0170">Cell-based studies revealed some promising insights into the potential of PDA1 as a scaffold for future SFK allosteric inhibitor development. Cellular thermal shift assays demonstrate that PDA1 enters cells and interacts directly with Hck in a manner dependent on the SH3 domain. Consistent with this observation, PDA1 treatment had a modest impact on the viability of leukemia cells that are dependent on active Hck for growth, and this effect also required an intact SH3 domain. While PDA1 did not consistently inhibit recombinant Hck activity <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>, in cells, it may target an active kinase conformation or interfere with SH3-dependent substrate recruitment as described above.</p><p id="p0175">In summary, our study identifies PDA1 as a starting point for SFK allosteric inhibitor development for use in combination with an orthosteric inhibitor in a double-drugging approach to combat emergence of drug resistance in AML or other SFK-dependent cancers. This approach shows promise in CML where the combination of an allosteric inhibitor (asciminib) and an orthosteric inhibitor (nilotinib) of Bcr-Abl completely suppressed the emergence of drug resistance in an animal model of CML <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> while either drug individually did not (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The authors conclude that the complementary, nonoverlapping resistance profiles of these two inhibitors were responsible for the suppression of drug resistance. That said, some caution is needed, because CML cells can evolve that develop Bcr-Abl independence and no longer respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Cellular thermal shift assays showed that PDA1 binding to Hck was not affected by a kinase domain gatekeeper mutation that renders Hck resistant to the ATP-site inhibitor, A-419259. This observation suggests that PDA1 analogs may complement ATP-site inhibitors similarly to asciminib. Future development of PDA1 will focus on enhancing binding potency, SH3 domain selectivity, and allosteric inhibition of kinase activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Expression and purification of recombinant Hck proteins</title><p id="p0180">The nucleotide sequences for the SFKs Hck, Lyn, and Src&#x000a0;were PCR-amplified and subcloned into pET-28a (near-full-length kinases; SH3-SH2-kinase-tail), pET-30a (unique-SH3-SH2-linker; U32L), or pET-21a (SH3, SH3-SH2, and SH3-SH2-linker) expression vectors (Millipore Sigma) using either standard restriction digestion and ligation or the Gibson Assembly procedure (New England Biolabs).

During minimization and heating, restraints on the protein and compounds were progressively weakened to zero for equilibration and production runs. Triplicate production runs of at least 300&#x000a0;ns were run for both compounds. Since the compounds were predicted to bind at the SH3-linker interface, generating starting structures from the poses with all Hck atoms and no clashes involved modeling potential motion of the SH3 and SH2 domains relative to the rest of the protein. To this end, the SH2 and SH3 domain region of Hck was simulated alone according to the above procedure. Then, the compound pose was aligned to the simulated SH3 domain. Finally, this complex was inspected for clashes and the RMSD (without fitting) of the simulated SH3 domain was ensured to be no more than 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000c5; from the initial crystal structure. Three starting structures were generated and simulated for each compound to improve confidence and ensure the results are not dependent on a specific starting structure.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.8"><title>TF-1&#x000a0;cell culture and viability assays</title><p id="p0230">TF-1&#x000a0;cells were sourced from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of amphotericin B (Antibiotic-Antimycotic; Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific). Parental TF-1&#x000a0;cells and transduced cell populations expressing WT Hck also require human GM-CSF (1&#x000a0;ng/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific) to proliferate and survive in culture. 293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and prophylactic antibiotics as described above. Cell lines are routinely tested for <italic>mycoplasma</italic> contamination.</p><p id="p0235">Full-length cDNA clones of WT Hck and cc-Hck were subcloned into the retroviral expression vector pMSCV-puro (Takara Bio). Mutations were introduced into the coding sequences using Gibson Assembly (New England Biolabs). Retroviral stocks were produced in 293T cells cotransfected with each pMSCV construct and an amphotropic packaging vector. For retroviral transduction, TF-1&#x000a0;cells (10<sup>6</sup>) were resuspended in 5.0&#x000a0;ml of undiluted viral supernatant and centrifuged at 1000<italic>g</italic> for 4&#x000a0;h at 18 &#x000b0;C. Viral supernatants were supplemented with Polybrene (4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml; Millipore Sigma) to enhance viral infection. Forty-eight hours later, transduced cells were selected with 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml puromycin and maintained in 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml puromycin. TF-1&#x000a0;cell populations expressing cc-Hck proliferated in a GM-CSF&#x02013;independent manner and were subsequently subcultured in the absence of GM-CSF.</p><p id="p0240">To assess viability, cells were seeded at 10<sup>5</sup>/ml in the presence or absence of inhibitors with DMSO as carrier solvent (0.1% final concentration). Cell viability was assayed using the CellTiter-Blue reagent and the supplier&#x02019;s instructions (Promega). Fluorescence intensity, which corresponds to changes in viable cell number, was measured using a SpectraMax i3X microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Fluorescence measurements were corrected for background observed with wells containing media only. Each experiment included three technical replicates per condition and concentration-response data were best-fit by nonlinear regression analysis to determine IC<sub>50</sub> values (GraphPad Prism).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.9"><title>Cellular thermal shift assay</title><p id="p0245">This experimental procedure was adapted from Jafari <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) TF-1&#x000a0;cells expressing full length WT or mutant Hck were cultured as described above to a density of 10<sup>6</sup>&#x000a0;cells/ml. To establish a baseline thermal shift curve, cells (1.3&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>) were transferred to a 10&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;cell culture plate and in medium containing 0.1% DMSO. Following incubation at 37 &#x000b0;C for 1&#x000a0;h, 8&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup>&#x000a0;cells were removed and pelleted at 300<italic>g</italic> for 4&#x000a0;min. Cells were washed with PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in 800&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of PBS with cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Millipore Sigma) for a final concentration of 10<sup>7</sup>&#x000a0;cells/ml. Cell aliquots (50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l) were pipetted into 12&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 0.5&#x000a0;ml PCR tubes and placed on a PCR gradient heating block set for a gradient between 34.9 and 55.7 &#x000b0;C for 3&#x000a0;min. Cells were then incubated at room temperature for 3&#x000a0;min before snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. The samples were then stored at&#x000a0;&#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C or thawed on a 25 &#x000b0;C heating block for 2&#x000a0;min, vortexed, and then frozen again. After a second thaw and vortex, the lysates were transferred to 1.5&#x000a0;ml microcentrifuge tubes and spun at top speed for 20&#x000a0;min at 4 &#x000b0;C. Clarified lysates (15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l) were mixed with 15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 2&#x000d7; SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated at 95 &#x000b0;C for 5&#x000a0;min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with rabbit Hck and mouse Actin antibodies. Proteins were visualized with secondary antibodies conjugated to IR dyes and imaged using a LICOR Odyssey clx instrument. Hck bands were quantified for each time point, and three replicate experiments were averaged to create a melting curve for further experiments.</p><p id="p0250">To test PDA and inhibitor effects on Hck stability, TF-1&#x000a0;cells expressing WT or mutant Hck proteins were diluted to 10<sup>6</sup>&#x000a0;cells/ml and incubated with 300&#x000a0;nM A-419259, 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M PDA1 or PDA2, or 0.1% DMSO as vehicle control. Five replicates of 1.7&#x000a0;ml were prepared for each condition. Cells were incubated for 1&#x000a0;h at 37 &#x000b0;C and 1.4&#x000a0;ml from each sample was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and pelleted by centrifugation at 300<italic>g</italic> for 4&#x000a0;min. Cells were washed in PBS, re-pelleted, and then suspended in 140&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of PBS with cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (MilliporeSigma). Each sample was then split into two 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l aliquots in PCR tubes. One was heated at 35 &#x000b0;C and the other at 47.5 &#x000b0;C for 3&#x000a0;min; a control experiment showed that the higher temperature did not affect actin stability. Cells were then lysed and clarified lysates were analyzed by immunoblot as described above. Hck band intensities were divided by the actin band intensities to correct for loading. The Hck:Actin ratios at 47.5 &#x000b0;C were then divided by those at 35 &#x000b0;C to determine the percent aggregation at 47.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Each sample was immunoblotted twice, and the percent aggregation for each sample was averaged between the&#x000a0;two technical replicates. The data was then normalized to the average stability of the DMSO control samples.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec4"><title>Data availability</title><p id="p0255">All data are described in the manuscript and in the <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supporting information</xref> file.
