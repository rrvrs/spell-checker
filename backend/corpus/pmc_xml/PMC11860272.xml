These patients suffer from frequent bacterial and fungal infections, and tissue granuloma formation is one of the characteristics of this disease [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The most commonly involved organs in this disease are the lungs, lymph nodes, liver, and skin. CGD is usually diagnosed between the ages of 1 and 3&#x02009;years. Milder forms of the disease appear older and have a longer lifespan [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Known treatments such as prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals, and interferon (IFN)&#x02010;&#x003b3; have improved the outcome, but infections are still associated with high morbidity and mortality in these patients. The lung is the most common site of infection in CGD patients, and 87% of patients experience at least one episode of lung infection in their lifetime [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The almost high rate of infections in CGD patients despite prophylactic treatments can be due to inescapable exposures to environmental infections and the complexity of prophylactic treatment in a disease with an intermittently reinforced nature [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Infection with <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">

Signs and symptoms may include fever, fatigue, malaise, chronic cough, dyspnea, leukocytosis, or neutrophilia; however, these symptoms can be mistaken for other infections or complications related to CGD [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Considering possible atypical manifestations of TB in CGD patients and its diagnostic challenge, we report a 27&#x02010;year&#x02010;old male patient with a known case of CGD who presented with shortness of breath and a productive cough. Following clinical and diagnostic evaluations, he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis.</p></sec><sec id="ccr370279-sec-0002"><label>2</label><title>Case History/Examination</title><p>A 27&#x02010;year&#x02010;old male patient with a known case of CGD was admitted to the emergency room with the chief complaint of severe dyspnea and a productive cough. The dyspnea and productive cough began 20&#x02009;days ago. The patient's dyspnea was progressive and in such a way that the patient had shortness of breath during routine daily activities. The patient already had occasional non&#x02010;productive coughs, which increased and became productive 20&#x02009;days before the patient's visit. The patient has had occasional fevers for the past 3&#x02009;weeks. He did not have recent weight loss.</p><p>The patient had a known case of CGD since 5&#x02009;years old, with the initial manifestation of recurrent Pneumonia. At the same 5&#x02009;years old, he had undergone lobectomy of the right lower lobe due to localized bronchiectasis. The patient had occasional generalized tonic&#x02010;clonic seizures 5&#x02009;years ago, and treatment with antiseizure medications was administered for the patient. One year ago, the patient had a pulmonary embolism (PE), which was treated with apixaban (5&#x02009;mg twice daily) for 6 months. He has been hospitalized many times due to Pneumonia; the last one was 1 year ago. The patient was diagnosed with Aspergillus pneumonia in the last hospitalization (1 year ago).</p><p>The patient has been treated with co&#x02010;trimoxazole (400/80&#x02009;mg twice daily), levofloxacin (500&#x02009;mg once daily), itraconazole (100&#x02009;mg twice daily), levetiracetam (500&#x02009;mg twice daily), carbamazepine (200&#x02009;mg twice daily), sodium valproate (500&#x02009;mg twice daily), escitalopram (20&#x02009;mg once daily), N&#x02010;acetylcysteine (600&#x02009;mg once daily), tiotropium (18 mcg/capsule inhaled once daily), and Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (125/25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) (one inhalation twice daily).</p><p>The patient had no history of smoking or opium addiction. The patient had no history of similar pulmonary disease in first&#x02010; and second&#x02010;degree relatives.</p><p>In the clinical examination at the emergency room, blood pressure was 95/63&#x02009;mmHg, respiratory rate was 33/min, pulse rate was 140/min, temperature was 37.8&#x000b0;C, and oxygen saturation was 78% without supplemental oxygen and 96% with a nonrebreathing oxygen mask. The patient's weight and height were 51&#x02009;kg and 173&#x02009;m, respectively.</p><p>The patient was not pale in the clinical examination. There was no cyanosis in the examination of the lips and oral mucosa. He had fine crackles in the bases of both lungs.

Another differential diagnosis was PE. The patient's coronavirus disease&#x02010;2019 (COVID&#x02010;19) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was negative. Considering the previous history of PE and the sudden onset of shortness of breath and tachycardia, lung CT angiography was performed for the patient with suspicion of PE. No new embolism was seen in the imaging, and the only evidence of centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema was observed in the lung parenchyma, with a preference for the upper lobes. Also, scattered ground glass opacities and consolidations in the left lower lobe were observed (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="ccr370279-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="ccr370279-fig-0001"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Primary lung CT angiography of the patients.

Considering the patient's past medical history of CGD and patient's clinical and radiologic findings, including hypoxemia, empiric antibiotics for coverage of gram&#x02010;negative pathogens (like pseudomonas), besides routine pathogens, were essential, so the patient was treated with ciprofloxacin (400&#x02009;mg twice daily), meropenem (1&#x02009;g every 12&#x02009;h), and methylprednisolone (40&#x02009;mg once daily). Other drugs that the patient was already using were also prescribed by the prior dosage to the patient (co&#x02010;trimoxazole, itraconazole, levetiracetam, carbamazepine, sodium valproate, escitalopram, N&#x02010;acetylcysteine).</p><p>In the patient's echocardiography, he had an ejection fraction of 45%, right ventricular enlargement, severe tricuspid regurgitation, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) of 65&#x02009;mmHg, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and global hypokinesia. A diuretic (furosemide 20&#x02009;mg twice daily) was prescribed to the patient.</p><p>During hospitalization, hypoxia and the patient's general condition improved relatively. However, 11&#x02009;days after the patient's admission, he developed a fever again, and vancomycin (1&#x02009;g every 12&#x02009;h) was added to the patient's antibiotic treatment.</p><p>The patient's fever continued despite treatment with three intravenous antibiotics, so a CT scan of the sinuses and lungs, sepsis workup, and examination of sputum for Pneumocystis, Mucormycosis, and Aspergillus PCR were performed for the patient.

In this rare disease, phagocytes have defects in autophagy and activation of the inflammasome. As a result, the person becomes prone to severe infections of catalase&#x02010;positive bacteria, fungi, and granuloma tissue formation [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While based on previous studies, bacterial and fungal infections have a high prevalence in CGD patients, mycobacterial infections, including TB, have been reported less in these patients and pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In the presented case, a 27&#x02010;year&#x02010;old male with known CGD developed progressive dyspnea, a productive cough, and a fever. His clinical history of recurrent Pneumonia and a previous episode of Aspergillus pneumonia aligned with the typical infectious complications seen in CGD [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Initial suspicions focused on bacterial or fungal etiologies; however, identifying <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">

</styled-content> via transthoracic needle biopsy (TTNB) highlighted the necessity of considering a broader differential diagnosis in immunocompromised patients [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Hyperactivation of NF&#x02010;&#x00138;B and inflammasome in CGD phagocytes leads to the production of pro&#x02010;inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory manifestations such as granuloma formation [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, these patients are predisposed to granulomatous lesions, which can have manifestations similar to some infections and inflammatory conditions in radiological examinations [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In this case, imaging studies revealed patchy consolidations and ground glass opacities, which are not specific and can be seen in both fungal infections and TB [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The absence of fungal elements in the histopathological examination and the positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for TB ultimately confirmed the diagnosis.</p><p>Although the prevalence of TB has decreased in developed countries, there are still concerns about contracting it, especially in immunocompromised people such as CGD patients, primarily since this disease can still be transmitted from endemic areas to other areas during travel or migration [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Granuloma formation is a response of the immune system against structures that cannot be destroyed; therefore, in CGD patients, due to the defect in the formation of effective granulomas, patients are more susceptible to mycobacterial infections [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Among other mechanisms that can make CGD patients more susceptible to mycobacterial infections, we can mention the disruption in cytokine production and autophagy [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Despite broad&#x02010;spectrum antibiotic therapy, our patient had a delayed onset of fever during hospitalization, which indicates the complexity of diagnosing infections in CGD patients. Failure of initial treatment led to further evaluation and diagnosis of TB in this patient. In cases where standard treatment fails and there is clinical suspicion, tissue sampling and microbiological confirmation are necessary to establish the infection in these patients [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>TB treatment of CGD patients requires higher precision due to their immunodeficiency and the possibility of drug interactions [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Standard anti&#x02010;tubercular therapy was started for our patient, which led to the clinical improvement of the patient's condition. The risk of treatment complications of TB in CGD patients may be higher due to their immunodeficiency status, and they should be closely monitored during treatment [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>This case reveals the importance of considering TB in the differential diagnosis of CGD patients presenting with pulmonary symptoms. Interpreting clinical and radiological findings in these patients is difficult due to the underlying granulomatous inflammation, and definitive microbiological diagnoses are necessary. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of TB, like other infections in CGD patients, are necessary to reduce morbidity and prevent dissemination [<xref rid="ccr370279-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>This case study provides valuable insight into the diagnosis and management of TB in immunocompromised patients like CGD. A major strength of this case study is the detailed presentation of the patient's clinical history, diagnostic workup, and management of an atypical presentation of TB in an immunocompromised patient. Also, this case underscores the importance of using advanced techniques like TTNB for definitive microbiological confirmation of atypical cases with a high suspicion of TB.</p><p>Our study was a case report; its findings cannot be generalized to all CGD patients. Also, due to pulmonary hypertension and hypoxia, we could not perform a bronchoscopy on the patient, so we had limitations in exploring concurrent opportunistic infections.</p><p>Further studies are needed to identify trends and better characterize the relationship between CGD and mycobacterial infections. In addition, investigation for well&#x02010;tailored diagnostic tools for mycobacterial infections with higher sensitivity and specificity is necessary.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="ccr370279-sec-0006"><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>TB diagnosis in CGD patients may create complex clinical scenarios and require more precision and careful investigation.
