However, PP frequently involve unsimulated violent acts mostly experienced by women. Furthermore, some women participating in PP also report being coerced into unwanted sexual acts. Therefore, featuring in a PP could be experienced as a traumatic event, and could be associated with negative mental health disorders.</p></sec><sec id="sec2999"><title>Objectives</title><p>Our study examines mental health indicators among Women who have participated in at least one PP (WPP), and who consulted clinical psychologists, after referral by WPP support groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec3000"><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-six women were recruited by two clinical psychologists during an individual consultation. Participants completed the French versions of the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), as well as the 13-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-13). Data on socio-demographic characteristics, lifetime experience of sexual violence prior to participating in a PP, as well as the perceived effect of participating in a PP were also measured.</p></sec><sec id="sec3001"><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of participants was 31.2 (std=7), and the average age at first participation in a PP was 23.4 (std=6). The majority (78%) of participants reported lifetime experience of sexual violence prior to participation in a PP. Thirty women (83%) had a PCL5 score over 33 indicative of probable PTSD, and 28 women (78%) had a DES score of 30 or more indicating high levels of dissociation. Further, 16 participants (44%) reported a BDI-13 score over 16 indicating severe depression.</p></sec><sec id="sec3002"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights the high prevalence of PTSD, dissociative experiences, and depressive symptoms in a clinical population of women who featured in at least one PP. Further studies are needed to better understand the scale of the problem and optimize care interventions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3003"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
