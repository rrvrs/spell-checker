In this study, we aimed to genetically and pathologically characterize these viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that H5N1 viruses were classified into the G2d-0 genotype, whereas the H5N6 virus was a novel genotype in Japan, designated as G2c-12. The G2c-12 virus shared PB2, PB1, PA, HA, and M genes with previous G2c viruses, but had NP and NS genes originating from avian influenza viruses in wild birds abroad. The N6 NA gene was derived from an H5N6 HPAI virus that was different from the viruses responsible for the outbreaks in Japan in 2016&#x02013;2017 and 2017&#x02013;2018. Experimental infections in chickens infected with H5N1(G2d-0) and H5N6(G2c-12) HPAI viruses showed no significant differences in the 50% chicken lethal dose, mean death time, or virus shedding from the trachea and cloaca, or in the histopathological findings. Different genotypes of the viruses worldwide, their introduction into the country, and their stable lethality in chickens may have triggered the four consecutive seasons of HPAI outbreaks in Japan.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>high pathogenicity avian influenza virus</kwd><kwd>poultry farms</kwd><kwd>whole genome sequence</kwd><kwd>H5N1</kwd><kwd>H5N6</kwd><kwd>Japan</kwd><kwd>2023/2024 season</kwd><kwd>phylogenetic analysis</kwd><kwd>pathogenic analysis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan</funding-source><award-id>JPJ008617.23812859</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan under &#x0201c;Regulatory Research Projects for Food Safety, Animal Health, and Plant Protection&#x0201d; (grant JPJ008617.23812859).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-16-01956"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In 1996, an outbreak of the high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5, A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (Gs/Gd), was reported in China [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since then, the Gs/Gd H5Nx HPAI lineage has been a threat to the poultry industry worldwide [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These progeny viruses have evolved rapidly and are composed of 10 divergent hemagglutinin (HA) clades (0&#x02013;9) and several subclades [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The clade 2.3.4.4 of HPAI viruses emerged in China in 2014 and began to dominate global outbreaks. According to the World Health Organization, it is divided into eight subclades (a&#x02013;h), of which subclade 2.3.4.4b is responsible for the largest number of HPAI epidemics worldwide [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI viruses were first reported as the H5N8 subtype in early 2014. They were then further reassorted with Eurasian low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses and disseminated from Siberia for detection in a wide range of areas, including Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This resulted in the emergence of the H5N1 virus in clade 2.3.4.4b in the 2020s. H5N1 reassortment has caused huge outbreaks in various wild bird species, including seabirds, on all continents except Australia, along with economic losses in the poultry industry [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The first outbreak caused by clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI in Japan was reported in the 2017/18 winter season [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Following the outbreak caused by the H5N6 subtype virus, the 2020/21 season outbreaks were caused by the H5N8 subtype virus. Since then, HPAI outbreaks caused by the H5Nx subtype viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b have been confirmed in Japan for three consecutive seasons [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Based on a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene, H5Nx viruses isolated in Japan were divided into two genetic groups: G1 and G2 [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The main genetic group that caused the recent outbreaks in Japan was G2 (those circulating in Europe in late 2020). The G2 group was further divided into sub-genetic groups G2a, G2b, G2c, and G2d [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The neuraminidase (NA) subtypes of the HPAI viruses also varied.</p><p>During the winter of 2023&#x02013;2024 in Japan, 11 outbreaks of HPAI (10 H5N1 and 1 H5N6) were identified on poultry premises in 10 prefectures. The first HPAI outbreak was reported on 24 November 2023, and the last was reported on 28 April 2024. During this period, approximately 856,000 poultry were culled to prevent and control HPAI outbreaks.</p><p>In this study, we genetically characterized the H5N1 and H5N6 subtype viruses that caused HPAI outbreaks in Japan during the 2023/2024 winter season using phylogenetic analyses for all eight segments, and investigated the virological characteristics of the representative isolates of both subtypes by the experimental infection of chickens.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01956"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-viruses-16-01956"><title>2.1. Virus Isolation and Whole-Genome Sequencing</title><p>For virus isolation, tracheal or cloacal swabs from poultry premises that tested positive using a rapid diagnostic kit (Fujirebio Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and were suspected of HPAI virus infection were inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs at the diagnostic laboratories of the Animal Health Service Centers in each prefecture. At the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH), Japan, we obtained allantoic fluid inoculated with swab samples that showed HA activity, based on Japanese pathological appraisal guidelines. Whole-genome sequences of the viruses were obtained using MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) next-generation sequencing technology, the details of which have been reported previously [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Two isolates were collected during each outbreak. Briefly, cDNA libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), and sequences were determined using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v. 2 (Illumina). The obtained sequence data were reconstructed into a complete consensus sequence using CLC Genomics Workbench (v. 23.0.2, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and FluGAS software (v. 2.5, World Fusion, Tokyo, Japan). Finally, we registered the newly identified viral sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (<uri xlink:href="http://platform.gisaid.org">http://platform.gisaid.org</uri> (accessed on 15 January 2024)) with accession numbers (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>). To construct the multiple sequence alignment, the nucleotide sequences of the avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were downloaded from GISAID (accessed on 18 June 2024). The loaded isolates sequenced with our 22 new isolates were aligned in MAFFT version 7.526 [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and edited using BioEdit v. 7.2.5 [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For phylogenetic analyses, sequences with ambiguous nucleotide bases were removed, leaving 36,365 sequences for polymerase basic protein (PB) 2 genes; 35,420 for PB1; 38,084 for polymerase acidic protein (PA); 18,779 for H5; 38,436 for nucleoprotein (NP); 13,858 for N1; 4504 for N6; 38,394 for matrix protein (MP); and 32,145 for nonstructural protein (NS). Maximum likelihood trees were constructed using FastTree v. 2.1.11 software [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] based on each gene of the multiple sequence alignment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-viruses-16-01956"><title>2.2. Animal Experiments</title><p>The following three HPAI viruses were used in the animal experiments: A/chicken/Saga/23A2T/2023 (Saga/23A2T, H5N1) and A/chicken/Kagoshima/23B1T/2024 (Kagoshima/23B1T, H5N6) as representative isolates of the current season, and A/chicken/Hokkaido/22B3C/2022 (Hokkaido/22B3C, H5N1) as a comparison isolate from the previous season. The experiments were approved by the Institutional Committee for Ethics of Animal Experiments (approved number R4-I014-NIAH-5) and conducted in biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities at NIAH. Animal experiments were designed as previously reported [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Fifty-five specific-pathogen-free White Leghorn chickens (four-week-old) were purchased from Nisseiken Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Serum was collected from all birds before virus inoculation and ELISA was performed using the IDEXX Influenza A Ab Test kit (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME, USA) to confirm that all chickens were serologically negative for influenza A virus. To evaluate the 50% lethal dose (CLD<sub>50</sub>), chickens housed in the isolator were randomly divided into eleven groups of five chickens each, with <italic toggle="yes">ad libitum</italic> access to food and water. Each group was intranasally inoculated with 100 &#x000b5;L of Saga/23A2T at doses ranging from 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> 50% egg infectious dose (EID<sub>50</sub>) or Kagoshima/23B1T and Hokkaido/22B3C at doses ranging from 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> per chicken. The mean death time (MDT) of infected chickens was calculated from the results of the 10<sup>6</sup> EID<sub>50</sub>-inoculated group. We clinically monitored all chickens and collected tracheal and cloacal swabs from chickens in the 10<sup>6</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> inoculated groups at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 days post-inoculation (dpi), or when the chickens died. The infected chickens were euthanized by the intravascular injection of an overdose of sodium pentobarbital at the end of the experiment, or when the humane endpoint was reached. The collected swabs were suspended in 2 mL minimum essential medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 25 mg/mL amphotericin B (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 1000 units/mL penicillin (Gibco), 1000 mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco), 0.01 M HEPES (Gibco), and sodium bicarbonate solution (Gibco), and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C until use. The swab fluids were inoculated into 9&#x02013;11-day-old embryonated eggs to measure the infectious viral titer, and the EID<sub>50</sub> was calculated using the Reed&#x02013;Muench method [<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The detection limit was 0.2 log EID<sub>50</sub>/mL. At the end of the experiment, serum was collected from surviving chickens and tested for infection.

Immunostaining was performed using an antibody-labeled polymer method to detect viral antigens. Endogenous peroxidase activity in sections was blocked using 3% hydrogen peroxide in ultrapure water. The antigen retrieval step involved digestion using 1 mg/mL of actinase E (Kaken Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at 37 &#x000b0;C. The sections were blocked with PBS containing 5% skim milk (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemicals Co., Osaka, Japan). The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for the nucleoprotein of influenza virus A (1:1000; HYB 340-05; Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark). The Histofine Simple Stain MAX-PO(M) kit (Nichirei Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) was used for the secondary antibody. Immunoreactivity was determined using 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine.

A genetically similar NS gene was detected in the H5N1 virus (A/duck/Bangladesh/58587/2023) from the G2c subgroup isolated in Bangladesh in August 2023.

Discussion</title><p>In this study, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the full genomes of the H5N1- and H5N6-subtype HPAI viruses that caused all outbreaks in poultry premises and wild birds in Japan, and performed animal experiments to determine the infectivity and virulence of the representative isolates of both subtypes in Japan during the winter of 2023&#x02013;2024.</p><p>Two different genotypes, G2d-0 and G2c-12, were identified in Japan during the current season. The G2d-0 HPAI (H5N1) virus has been detected in Japan for three consecutive years, suggesting that this genotype may be better adapted to wild birds and maintained in wild bird populations. Notably, even within the G2d-0 genotype viruses, all eight segments of the H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated in the winter of 2023&#x02013;2024 were genetically closer to those of the HPAI viruses isolated in the winter of 2021&#x02013;2022 than to those isolated in the winter of 2022&#x02013;2023. The G2d-0 genotype viruses isolated in the winter of 2022&#x02013;2023 were genetically closer to the HPAI viruses isolated mainly in Alaska and on the west coast of North America during the winter of 2023&#x02013;2024. HPAI outbreaks in poultry premises caused by the G2d-0 genotype virus have tended to occur mainly in northern Japan (e.g., Hokkaido, Aomori, and Iwate) during the past two seasons [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, in the current season (winter of 2023&#x02013;2024), outbreaks caused by the G2d-0 genotype virus were confirmed across a broad area, predominantly in the southern regions located below the Kanto region in southeastern and eastern areas of Japan, i.e., there was no HPAI outbreak on poultry premises in northern Japan during winter. We used the sequences uploaded to GISAID before 18 June 2024 to construct the phylogenetic tree, and to our knowledge, we identified the H5N1-subtype G2d-0 viruses derived from Korea for the first time (<xref rid="viruses-16-01956-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These results suggest that the G2d-0 genotype viruses in the current season spread to Japan via routes different from those of viruses in the previous two seasons. Although the HPAI virus was detected in wild birds in the northern regions of Japan (e.g., Hokkaido, Aomori, and Iwate), the change in migratory routes among the wild bird groups with G2d-0 in the 2022/2023 season may have resulted in a decrease in the concentration of the virus in the environment and prevented outbreaks in poultry in the northern areas. Among the G2c viruses isolated in Japan during the 2022/2023 season, eleven genotypes were reported; the viruses possessed multiple internal genes derived from wild bird AIVs [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. An H5N6 virus isolated in the current season exhibited a new genotype designated as G2c-12; its NP and NS genes were closely related with those of H4N6 AIV isolated in Novosibirsk and the H1N1 AIV isolated in Korea, respectively. Moreover, the NA gene of the G2c-12 virus shared a common ancestor with H5N6 G2a subgroup HPAI viruses isolated in China. These results validate the previously reported suggestion that the genetic diversity of AIVs in Asia and Russia influences the emergence of numerous G2c genotypes [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the full genomes of the H5N6-subtype HPAI virus, this genotype may have emerged in East Asia and/or Siberia due to the reassortment of G2c subgroup HPAI viruses, G2a subtype HPAI viruses, and various avian influenza viruses (<xref rid="viruses-16-01956-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Similar to the G2d-0 genotype virus, all eight segments of the G2c-12 genotype virus phylogenetically formed a single cluster with the H5N6 HPAI virus isolated in Korea during the winter season. Collectively, it is reasonable that both genotypes of viruses isolated during the winter of 2023&#x02013;2024 would intrude into Japan from Central and/or East Asia via migratory wild birds.</p><p>In animal experiments, the infectivity of representative isolates of both H5N1 and H5N6 subtypes was assessed based on virus shedding and the CLD<sub>50</sub> value. No surviving chickens exhibited detectable antibodies against the influenza A virus or signs of viral shedding. This suggests that the CLD<sub>50</sub> is aligned with the chicken infectious dose. The virulence of the isolates was evaluated based on MDT and pathological findings. The levels of infectivity of Saga/23A2T(H5N1) and Kagoshima/23B1T(H5N6) were equivalent. In addition, no change in chicken lethality was observed in Saga/23A2T compared to those with Hokkaido/22B3C, which belonged to the same group in the previous season. A previous report indicated that isolates belonging to the same subclade exhibit similar infectivity, and peak viral shedding is not significantly different among the subclades [<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Notably, one chicken from the 10<sup>6</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> Kagoshima/23B1T inoculation group remained uninfected. Some H5-subtype isolates belonging to the clade 2.3.4.4b fail to infect all chickens, even at high doses, such as A/chicken/England/053052/2021, which is highly adapted to ducks, but less adapted to chickens [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The CLD<sub>50</sub> of this isolate is 4.67 log<sub>10</sub>EID<sub>50</sub>, which is very close to that of Kagoshima/23B1T (4.60 log<sub>10</sub>EID<sub>50</sub>). Another study found that the adaptation of HPAI viruses to mallard ducks reduces their lethality in chickens, requiring high-dose inoculation to cause mortality. Even with a high-dose viral inoculation, a small number of chickens survive [<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Notably, the CLD<sub>50</sub> of H5N1 HAPIV isolated in 2004 (A/chicken/Yamaguchi/7/2004) was 2.0 log10 EID<sub>50</sub> [<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], indicating a 300-fold higher infectivity than that of the current isolates. One possibility is that the recent increase in CLD<sub>50</sub> may be due to a reduction in adaptation to chickens over the past 20 years.</p><p>Our results suggest that the degrees of virulence of Saga/23A2T and Kagoshima/23B1T are indistinguishable. All chickens infected with both isolates died shortly after inoculation, exhibiting no obvious clinical signs, and presenting no lesions upon external examination. Although the MDT tended to be slightly longer for Saga/23A2T, this difference was not noteworthy when compared to our previous studies [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The most common pathological findings associated with H5-subtype HPAI viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b infection in poultry species are pancreatic and splenic necrosis [<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, in the present study, no necrotic foci or hemorrhages were macroscopically observed in these organs, and the main lesions consistently observed during necropsy were hydropericardium and pneumonia. Given that the reports of pancreatic and splenic necrosis and hemorrhages were based on post-mortem analyses of naturally affected birds, the inconsistent findings of the present study may be attributed to the acute conditions resulting from the high virus dose and short time to death.</p><p>Histopathologically, the most severely affected tissues were the lungs, spleen, brain, and pancreas. These lesions are consistent with those observed in recent studies on experimental infections with H5-subtype HPAI viruses of the 2.3.4.4b clade in chickens [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In clade 2.3.4.4, regardless of the subclades and NA subtypes, the major lesions, including parenchymal cell necrosis with lymphoplasmacytic and heterophilic inflammatory infiltrates, observed in affected chickens were similar, although there were some differences in the severity of lesions [<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01956" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the histological lesions observed in the systemic organs were caused by viral replication, suggesting that systemic infection and the associated multiple organ dysfunctions were the causes of mortality, as predicted. The number of chickens available for histological examination was limited; therefore, the reason for the variation in viral antigens among the isolates remains unclear. However, this may presumably be due to the different timings of autopsies after infection. In summary, the differences in isolates were unlikely to significantly influence tissue tropism or pathogenicity in the current study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-viruses-16-01956"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we characterized H5 HPAI isolates from Japanese domestic poultry during the 2023/2024 season, using a basic virological approach. We demonstrated that the common characteristics of HPAI viruses in previous experimental chicken infections, such as short incubation periods and high mortality rates, may not have changed. In addition, the outbreak periods were generally unchanged from those of previous seasons. These results indicate that the most important way to reduce the number of outbreaks is to maintain high levels of biosecurity during the winter season when HPAI viruses are detected in environments containing migratory birds. However, new genotypes with various internal genes closely related to AIVs isolated in Siberia and other Asian regions were found in Japan over four consecutive seasons, suggesting that frequent gene reassortment between HPAI viruses and other AIVs continues to occur in wild bird populations, including migratory birds. Additionally, the G2d-0 genotype was found for three consecutive years, suggesting the possibility that this genotype may be stably maintained in wild bird populations. In the future, we plan to analyze the molecular mechanism of the G2d-0 genotype, determine the reason for its stability in wild bird populations, and conduct a detailed analysis through comparative studies of pathogenicity in wild birds.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the veterinarians and staff involved in sample collection at animal health centers in Japan.
