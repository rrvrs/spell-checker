Effective embolization requires an embolic material to reach the tumor&#x02019;s feeding arteries. In particle embolization, particles travel via arterial blood flow to occlude feeding vessels within the tumor. To enhance embolization, we temporarily reduced transosseous blood flow from the cutaneous artery by inducing contraction of the superficial temporal artery (STA) and occipital artery (OA) through subcutaneous injection of lidocaine with epinephrine. A patient with a meningioma involving the superior sagittal sinus underwent preoperative embolization. A microcatheter was inserted into the middle meningeal artery (MMA), and angiography revealed tumor staining with late-phase backflow from perfusion pressure in other feeders. Using roadmap images from external carotid angiography, clustered cutaneous artery areas were identified. Subcutaneous injection of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was administered, resulting in expanded tumor staining and restored antegrade blood flow via the MMA. Embolization using Embosphere particles followed. Postoperative angiography showed reduced tumor enhancement, with no side effects from the injection. Subcutaneous lidocaine with epinephrine effectively suppresses the dominant transosseous blood supply, enhancing tumor embolization. This technique appears promising for improving preoperative outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>embosphere</kwd><kwd>epinephrine adverse effects</kwd><kwd>meningioma embolization</kwd><kwd>particle embolization</kwd><kwd>&#x000a0;lidocaine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Preoperative embolization of meningiomas is widely regarded as a safe and effective adjunct to surgery. However, its effects on postoperative outcomes have been limited [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Studies have reported reduced surgical bleeding, decreased need for blood transfusions, and shorter operative times when adequate intra-tumoral embolization was achieved [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, embolization has been associated with improved long-term outcomes, including recurrence-free survival [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>High convexity, parasagittal, and superior sagittal sinus meningiomas often have transosseus feeders from the superficial temporal artery (STA) or occipital artery (OA) [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In these cases, embolization through the middle meningeal artery (MMA) can be complicated by blood flow from transosseous feeders, preventing embolic material from reaching the tumor and leading to incomplete embolization.</p><p>To address this, various methods have been reported to improve the embolic effect by controlling the blood flow from transosseous feeders, when considering embolization from MMA [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this report, we present a case of subcutaneous injection of lidocaine with epinephrine to temporarily reduce blood flow from transosseous feeders, enhancing the intratumoral embolic effect during particle embolization with Embosphere via the MMA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 47-year-old female presented with a superior sagittal sinus meningioma, identified during an evaluation for persistent headaches (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Contrast-enhanced MRI findings</title><p>(A-1) Axial and (A-2) sagittal contrast-enhanced MRI images reveal a cystic tumor located near the sigmoid sinus in the parietal region, demonstrating uniform enhancement (white arrow).

In order to improve the efficacy of intra-tumoral embolization, there have been reports on the selection of embolization materials and target feeders, as well as on methods to increase tumor perfusion from the feeders for embolization.</p><p>Embolization material comparison</p><p>In comparisons between NBCA and Embosphere, no significant differences in resection time, intraoperative blood loss, or Simpson grade have been observed. The difference lies primarily in the surgeon's perception of "dryness" or "softness" during surgery, with Embosphere often preferred because it is less likely to affect the elasticity of the tumor [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The injection methods differ between particulate embolic materials and liquid embolic materials. Unlike particulate embolic agents such as Embosphere, which are highly dependent on antegrade blood flow to reach and occlude the target vasculature, liquid embolic materials like NBCA or Onyx can be delivered in a more controlled fashion [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These agents can penetrate the tumor vasculature even against the direction of flow, depending on the injection technique, and are therefore less influenced by hemodynamic conditions. For this reason, effective blood flow control is extremely important when using Embosphere for tumor embolization.</p><p>Feeder selection for embolization</p><p>Parasagittal and convexity meningiomas are more likely to achieve complete embolization [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, meningiomas fed by the transosseous can hinder effective embolization from the MMA due to competing blood flow from transosseous feeders. Selective embolization of transosseous feeders is often challenging due to the tortuosity of the vessels, and extensive occlusion can reduce skin blood flow, leading to ischemic necrosis and delayed wound healing [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, the MMA feeder is typically selected for embolization in most meningioma cases.</p><p>Techniques for flow control of transosseous feeders</p><p>When transosseous feeders are present, particles may not reach the tumor through the injection of Embosphere from MMA, resulting in inadequate embolization.&#x000a0;</p><p>Various techniques have been reported to control transosseous feeder flow. Manual STA compression [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the use of bilateral external carotid artery flow control during transarterial embolization [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and subcutaneous injection of lidocaine with epinephrine [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (as in this case) have all been reported as effective in a dural arteriovenous fistula case. The effect of transseus feeder blood flow suppression is not permanent for each technique. This is to avoid necrosis due to poor blood flow in the skin and delayed wound healing after surgery.</p><p>Balloon-guiding catheter (BGC)-assisted embolization has been reported as another strategy for temporary flow control, particularly in cases with significant transosseous supply [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While this technique enables real-time, adjustable occlusion of the external carotid artery (ECA), it simultaneously reduces flow through the middle meningeal artery (MMA), potentially compromising the forward delivery of particulate embolic agents. In contrast, our approach selectively reduces flow from transosseous feeders without diminishing MMA perfusion, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of MMA-directed embolization. Additionally, our method offers a simpler setup with fewer systemic effects and lower procedural cost.</p><p>In the present case, we used 1% lidocaine with epinephrine, a solution commonly utilized for local anesthesia. Using this technique, we injected the epinephrine-containing lidocaine around the transosseous feeders, previously identified using external carotid artery angiography, to reduce blood flow via vasoconstriction. A relatively large volume of 20 mL was administered, which caused the skin to become taut, further decreasing blood flow through mechanical compression. The lidocaine component helped alleviate the discomfort associated with the tightness by providing local analgesia, thereby reducing the patient&#x02019;s overall distress. The transient effects of the injection ensure that normal blood flow to the skin resumes after embolization, minimizing the risks of skin necrosis and delayed wound healing. This approach balances effective blood flow modulation with patient safety and comfort.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>This is a case report, and the described technique may not be universally applicable. The lack of post-embolization contrast-enhanced MRI prevented quantitative assessment of embolization extent. In addition, the outcomes were not compared with those of simple middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization, so the additional benefit of the technique remains unproven. Furthermore, as this method restores tumor perfusion via transosseous feeders following embolization, there is a potential risk of intratumoral bleeding. Further studies with larger cohorts are required to evaluate the incidence of post-embolization tumor bleeding.</p><p>Other potential complications also warrant consideration. Although no adverse events were observed in this case, subcutaneous injection of lidocaine with epinephrine carries theoretical risks, including skin necrosis, delayed wound healing, and systemic effects such as hypertension, tachycardia, or arrhythmia. While the vasoconstrictive effect of epinephrine is temporary and unlikely to impact surgical resection performed hours or days later, systemic safety cannot be fully established based on a single case. Additional investigation is needed to assess the safety profile of this technique in broader clinical use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The subcutaneous injection of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine may help reduce transosseous arterial supply from cutaneous branches in meningioma cases with significant transosseous feeders. This technique appears to increase the relative perfusion territory of the middle meningeal artery, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of particle embolization via the MMA. Based on this case, the method is technically straightforward and was performed without observed complications; however, further studies are needed to assess its safety and efficacy more robustly.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
