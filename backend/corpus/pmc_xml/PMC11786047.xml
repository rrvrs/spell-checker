Despite its significance, there remains a scarcity of studies utilizing this technology to address treatment strategies specifically tailored for early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Consequently, this study aimed to investigate the tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics and develop a prognostic model for early-stage LUAD.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The markers identifying cell types were obtained from the CellMarker database and published research. The SCEVAN package was employed for identifying malignant lung epithelial cells. Single-cell downstream analyses were conducted using the SCP package, encompassing gene set enrichment analysis, enrichment analysis, pseudotime trajectory analysis, and differential expression analysis. Calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic curves, and decision curve analysis were employed to assess the performance of the prognostic model for LUAD. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blot, cell transfection, cell proliferation, and cell invasion assays were performed to validate the expression and biological function.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Seven cell types were distinguished in the scRNA-seq dataset through the utilization of cell markers documented in published literature. Four subpopulations of early-stage LUAD tumor cells exhibited a high degree of heterogeneity. The prognostic model constructed by <italic>PERP</italic> and <italic>KRT8</italic> showed a great prediction for distinguishing the early-stage LUAD and normal tissues. The validation of <italic>PERP</italic> and <italic>KRT8</italic> expression levels was carried out through both RT-qPCR and western blot analyses. Eventually, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, including CCK8, colony formation, EdU, and transwell assays, confirmed that <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> could promote LUAD cell proliferation and migration.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study provided a comprehensive characterization of the TME in LUAD through integrative single-cell and bulk transcriptomic analyses. We identified dynamic transitions from normal epithelial cells to tumor cells, revealing the heterogeneity and evolution of malignant LUAD cells. The novel prognostic model based on KRT8 and PERP demonstrated robust predictive performance, offering a promising tool for early-stage LUAD risk stratification. Functional experiments further confirmed that KRT8 and PERP promote tumor proliferation and migration, providing new insights into their roles as therapeutic targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Lung Adenocarcinoma</kwd><kwd>Single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>Tumor microenvironment</kwd><kwd>Biomarkers</kwd><kwd>Prognostic model</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Globally, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Even in its early stages, the prognosis for patients with lung cancer is relatively unfavorable when compared to other prevalent cancers, like colon, breast, and prostate cancer<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) stands out as the most frequently diagnosed pathological type of lung cancer in clinical practice<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Recently, many patients with LUAD have been detected by low-dose computed tomography at earlier pathological stages<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Subsequently, a growing number of instances of early diagnoses in LUAD have underscored the necessity for novel personalized early treatment approaches. The effectiveness of such strategies is contingent upon an enhanced comprehension of the molecular and cellular processes occurring during the early stages of LUAD.</p><p>Tumor microenvironment (TME) is essential for tumor development, and many studies have shown that TME is a vital source of intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH)<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Therefore, it is necessary to characterize TME and ITH at different stages of LUAD comprehensively. Moreover, most studies investigating LUAD transcriptome profiles have been based on bulk RNA techniques, which may not be able to detect the cellular diversity and molecular complexity of tumor cells. The advent of scRNA-seq has proven to be a potent tool for comprehensively unraveling the cellular composition of resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. This technological advancement has successfully overcome previous technical limitations, providing a deeper insight into the heterogeneity inherent in NSCLC<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Consequently, a more profound understanding of the TME in LUAD could contribute to unveiling the mechanisms underpinning tumor progression and onset. Moreover, it holds promise in identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for LUAD.</p><p>We thoroughly analyzed the TME in LUAD and developed a prognostic model that includes <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> in this study. Additionally, the evolution of lung epithelial cells into tumor cells exhibited dynamic alterations, highlighting a nuanced understanding of this transitional process. This study also revealed high heterogeneity among tumor cells, further emphasizing the diverse nature of these cancerous cells in LUAD. Finally, in order to validate the biological function of two genes, <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were conducted. Our discoveries have yielded fresh perspectives on the development of biomarkers for early-stage LUAD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Data collection and preprocessing</title><p>The single cell-RNA expression profiles were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus database. Three pairs of early-stage LUAD and normal samples in the GSE117570 dataset were included in the following analysis. We leveraged the TCGAbiolinks package to retrieve bulk RNA expression data and associated clinical information for 427 patients diagnosed with early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) via R4.2.2. The 321 early-stage LUAD samples were extracted from the GSE72094 dataset.</p><p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUAD dataset served as the training dataset, with GSE72094 utilized as the validation dataset.</p><p>To obtain high-quality single cells, we performed the following criteria to remove low-quality single cells and potential doublet: 1. The genes detected per cell was &#x0003e;300. 2.UMIs &#x0003e;500. 3. The portion of the mitochondria-expressed gene was &#x0003c;40%. Furthermore, the doubletfinder package was conducted to remove potential doublet. Moreover, to remove the batch effect, a harmony package was conducted. The gene expression value of TCGA-LUAD samples was transformed into TPM to reduce the effect of sequencing depth and gene length.</p><p>To ensure consistency and reliability, we applied strict inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection. Inclusion criteria included patients diagnosed with early-stage LUAD (stage I or II), no history of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and no history of other tumors prior to diagnosis. Patients without complete prognostic information or expression profiles were excluded. The detailed clinicopathological parameters of patients were summarized and are provided in Additional File 1: <xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>CNV analysis</title><p>SCEVAN is a simple and effective package to distinguish the tumor and normal cells for the scRNA-seq dataset. The expression matrix of lung alveolar epithelial cells was extracted and subjected to copy number variation (CNV) analysis to identify malignant lung alveolar epithelial cells using the SCEVAN package.</p></sec><sec><title>Single-cell downstream analysis</title><p>The SCP package (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/zhanghao-njmu/SCP" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/zhanghao-njmu/SCP</ext-link>) was used to infer the development of the potential cell lineage by the slingshot algorithm. Furthermore, the biological dynamic changes, including gene expression and ontology, were analyzed for the cell lineage.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription factor analysis</title><p>To investigate the heterogeneity of four distinct tumor subgroups further, the pySCENIC analysis was performed by the Linux system. The expression matrix of four subgroups was extracted and transformed into loom format through Python 3.9. After the standard three steps (GRN, cisTarget, and AUCell) of pySCENIC, the output file was obtained and visualized using R.4.2.2.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of the prognostic model</title><p>The C3 subgroup markers were obtained by the RunDEtest() function in SCP. Eighty-nine genes with log2 fold change &#x0003e;1 and P-value &#x0003c;0.05 were considered markers of the C3 subgroup. A total of 4235 differential-expressed genes in LUAD tissue (compared to normal tissues) were calculated using the edgeR package. The intersection of the genes resulted in the identification of 25 genes. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was employed to filter critical genes for LUAD prognosis. Multivariate COX analysis was conducted to calculate the coefficients. The discriminative performance of the model for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates was assessed by using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. High- and low-risk patient groups were stratified using the best cutoff value determined by the survminer package in R, which selects the optimal threshold based on the maximized log-rank statistic for survival analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves were employed to assess survival outcomes in both high- and low-risk groups. To assess the model's ability to predict accurately, we employed calibration curves using the bootstrap method with 500 resamples.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential drugs for patients with high-risk</title><p>The genes exhibiting differential expression between patients with high and low risk in the TCGA-LUAD dataset were estimated by edgeR package. Subsequently, the hallmark gene sets were used to annotate signaling changes in the patients with high risk. Furthermore, the potential drugs for patients with high risk were estimated by the connectivity map (CMAP) database. Specifically, we uploaded 300 differential genes between high and low groups. Moreover, the CMAP database calculated and returned drugs with a value between -1 to 1. Smaller values indicate more effective drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>UALCAN</title><p>UALCAN (<ext-link xlink:href="http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/analysis.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/analysis.html</ext-link>) serves as an online platform offering comprehensive analysis of gene expression, utilizing data from TCGA<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.

The cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAN-Seratech) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PS; HyClone) in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and humidified atmosphere at 37 &#x000b0;C. The siRNAs of <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> constructs were synthesized by RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). The protocol of cell transfection was conducted as previously described<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.

The collected protein was denatured at 95 &#x000b0;C in a water bath for 10 min. The protein concentration was determined following the manufacturer's instructions using a bicinchoninic acid protein analysis kit (Solarbio). Equal amounts of proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies. The details of the antibodies used in this study are presented in Additional File 1: <xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry (IHC)</title><p>IHC was performed using standard protocols. Tissue sections underwent antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) using a pressure cooker for 15 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes, followed by blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Primary antibodies against KRT8 and PERP were applied overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing, HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Staining was visualized with DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin. Finally, sections were dehydrated and mounted for evaluation.

Percentage of positive cells: Scored as follows: 0 (0%), 1 (&#x0003c;25%), 2 (25-50%), 3 (&#x0003e;50%). The final IHC score was calculated by multiplying the intensity and percentage scores (range 0-9).

Subsequently, following scRNA-seq analysis, our data revealed 14 unique cell populations through clustering with principal component analysis (PCA) at a resolution of one. Data visualization through two-dimensional reduction techniques, namely t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), demonstrated distinct separation of various cell clusters, as depicted in Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A. Utilizing markers obtained from the cell marker database, cell types were further clarified, leading to the categorization of all cells into eight groups: T, NK, B, epithelial, myeloid, stromal, and SLC45A3+ cells, depicted in Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B. SLC45A3+ cells were identified as a group of cells lacking significant features of known cell markers. These cells were named based on the prominent expression of the gene SLC45A3. The markers employed for annotating cell types are illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C. For instance, <italic>NKG7</italic>, <italic>GNLY</italic>, and <italic>KLRD1</italic> are indicative of NK cell identity. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D, the cellular proportions of various cell types differed significantly between normal and tumor samples. For example, the proportion of NK and T cells was found to be higher in normal samples compared to tumor samples., suggesting immune dysregulation in TME. Moreover, tumor samples showed a significantly higher proportion of epithelial cells compared to normal samples. This may be caused by high cell proliferation of tumor cells. Seven cell types were identified for further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>The cell trajectory of LUAD epithelial cells</title><p>Tumor tissues comprise both malignant and benign epithelial cells, and SCEVAN offers promise in distinguishing these cell populations within a tumor microenvironment. As presented in Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, the yellow on the left represents the malignant epithelial cells, while the green represents normal epithelial cells. It was obvious that the malignant epithelial cells showed significantly higher levels of amplification and deletion. Furthermore, the CNV of malignant epithelial cells is demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B. Additionally, the distribution of tumor and normal epithelial cells was visualized by UMAP. We re-clustered the tumor cells into four groups based on PCA to explore the malignant cells further. As displayed in Figs. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D-E, the four distinct subgroups were separated, indicating the heterogeneity of tumor cells. To unravel the dynamic transition of epithelial cells within the LUAD microenvironment, we employed cell trajectory analysis. This approach allowed us to infer the potential developmental path from normal epithelial cells to tumor cells. As depicted in Figs. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A and C, the trajectory initiation featured tumor cells from the C0 cluster, while tumor cells from the C3 cluster were situated at the endpoint of the trajectory. To identify key genes and biological processes driving LUAD progression, we investigated the dynamic changes in gene expression patterns within the "lineage 1" trajectory derived from the cell trajectory analysis. As depicted in Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, we identified the most significant genes implicated in LUAD progression: <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, <italic>JUNB</italic>, <italic>BAMBI</italic>, <italic>THUMPD3-AS1</italic>, <italic>SPINK1</italic>, <italic>EGR1</italic>, <italic>ATF3</italic>, <italic>GEM</italic>, <italic>FOSB</italic>, <italic>SERPINH1</italic>, <italic>DNAJA4</italic>, MSLN, <italic>KRT19</italic>, <italic>TMSB4X</italic>, <italic>OCIAD2</italic>, <italic>SRD5A3</italic>, <italic>TPPP3</italic>, <italic>TUBA1A</italic>, <italic>FOXJ1</italic>, and <italic>RSPH1</italic>. The biological progress, including regulation of alpha-beta T cell activation and differentiation, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in response to stress, and positive regulation of tolerance induction, were potentially associated with LUAD progression. These observations disclosed the dynamic characteristics of biological processes throughout the trajectory, extending from C0 cluster tumor cells to C3 cluster tumor cells. Moreover, the genes identified in this context, closely associated with tumor cell development, hold the potential to function as valuable biomarkers for monitoring and understanding LUAD progression. To delve deeper into the distinctions among the four subgroups, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was conducted. As indicated in Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C, tumor cells of the C0 group enriched in TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and angiogenesis, G2M checkpoint, tumor cells of the C2 group enriched in hedgehog signaling, <italic>KRAS</italic> signaling, and G2M checkpoint, tumor cells of the C3 group enriched in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Collectively, these results implied that four tumor subgroups exhibited different biological differences. Moreover, transcription factor (TF) is a critical regulator for cell fate. We performed TF analysis for distinct subgroups (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). For instance, the TFs, including <italic>STAT3</italic>, <italic>TBL1XR1</italic>, <italic>NFKB2</italic>, <italic>EGR2</italic>, <italic>FOXO3</italic>, <italic>KLF10</italic>, <italic>IRF1</italic>, and <italic>DDIT3</italic> were more activated in C0 subgroup than other subgroups. TFs including <italic>STAT1</italic>, <italic>NFYA</italic>, <italic>HMGB3</italic>, <italic>KLF16</italic>, <italic>NR3C1</italic>, <italic>RFX2</italic>, <italic>CREB1</italic>, <italic>HDAC2</italic>, <italic>MXD4</italic>, <italic>ELK3</italic>, <italic>STAT5A</italic>, <italic>FOSL1</italic>, <italic>CREB3</italic>, and <italic>IRF7</italic> were more activated in C3 subgroup. These results preliminarily demonstrated the differences in TF activity between subpopulations and revealed the characteristics of each subpopulation. To estimate the prognostic value of the subgroups, we inferred the cell proportions in the TCGA-LUAD dataset by cibersoftX. As presented in Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E, only the C3 subgroup showed poor prognostic value in early-stage LUAD (Supplementary <xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>), suggesting that the C3 subgroup may promote tumor progression. In summary, four subpopulations of cells demonstrated a significant degree of intratumoral heterogeneity, and the C3 subgroup was a key subgroup that affected the prognosis of patients with early-stage LUAD. Therefore, it suggested that C3 markers hold promise for improving the prediction of prognosis in early-stage LUAD patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of critical prognostic genes for LUAD</title><p>In the pursuit of identifying crucial prognostic genes for LUAD, a comparative analysis of differential gene expression was conducted by juxtaposing epithelial and tumor cells. Subsequently, we identified 89 markers specific to C3 cluster tumor cells. Through the intersection of these two gene sets, 25 genes were initially pinpointed, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A. Further employing the LASSO method, we narrowed down to two critical genes, <italic>KRT8</italic> (HR=1.2, P=0.022) and <italic>PERP</italic> (HR=1.2, P=0.035), as depicted in Figs. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B-D. Subsequently, based on the optimal cut-off value identified in both the training and validation cohorts (Figs. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E-F), patients with tumors were categorized into high- and low-risk groups. Patients in the high-risk group showed a poor prognosis. Moreover, time-dependent ROC analysis confirms the robust prognostic value of our model for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS (Figs. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G-H). Statistical analyses were conducted to explore the association between transcriptomic profiles and specific clinical parameters, such as survival outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Nomogram construction</title><p>To construct the prognostic nomogram for early-stage LUAD, logistic regression was employed to construct a predictive model for LUAD risk based on the assigned risk scores (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Calibration curves showed that our model demonstrated high efficiency in predicting 1- and 3-year overall survival (OS) in both the training and validation cohorts. (Figs. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B-E). Furthermore, we analyzed differential gene expression between low- and high-risk groups of patients with tumors (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). <italic>PERP</italic> and <italic>KRT8</italic> were also upregulated. Then, to elucidate the potential biological functions associated with the 2-mRNA signature, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore the crucial pathways associated with the high-risk groups. As depicted in Figs. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B-E, the GSEA analysis revealed a significant enrichment of the high-risk group in pathways related to E2F targets (B), G2M checkpoint (C), glycolysis (D), and EMT (E). These findings hint at a potential association between the high-risk group and the activation or modulation of specific biological processes. The results further revealed heightened tumor proliferation and aggressiveness in patients belonging to the high-risk group. Given the poor prognosis of the high-risk group, there is a pressing need for additional potential drugs for intervention. We identified several drugs for high-risk group patients (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F). For example, AT-7519, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor and a cell cycle inhibitor, emerges as a potential candidate drug for patients classified as high risk.</p><p>In a word, the nomogram we constructed is a promising tool for predicting early-stage LUAD prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>KRT8 and PERP expression in patients with LUAD</title><p>To investigate the expression patterns of <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> in LUAD, UALCAN was employed (Figs. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A-B). The results showed significantly elevated <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> expression in LUAD tissues. To validate these findings, we assessed the mRNA levels of <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> in LUAD and corresponding normal samples from patients using RT-qPCR. Consistent with the database, the RT-qPCR results revealed a significant upregulation of <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> in LUAD compared to normal tissues. (Fig <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C-D). Next, we evaluated the expression levels of <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> in various LUAD cell lines using RT-qPCR. (Fig <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E-F) and western blot (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>G). The results demonstrated high expression levels of <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> in LUAD cell lines, while the western blot showed similar results. To investigate protein expression, we analyzed immunohistochemistry data from The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) for <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> in LUAD tissues and their corresponding normal controls. Our analysis revealed a significant upregulation of <italic>KRT8</italic> protein in LUAD compared to normal tissues (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>H). However, no difference was observed in the protein levels of <italic>PERP</italic>, possibly attributable to the extremely low mRNA levels of <italic>PERP</italic> in both LUAD and normal tissues (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>I).</p></sec><sec><title>KRT8 and PERP promote LUAD cell proliferation and migration <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To elucidate the functional roles of <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> in LUAD, we next performed <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments to assess their impact on key biological behaviors of LUAD cell lines, such as proliferation and invasion. The RT-qPCR results demonstrated elevated expression of <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> in LUAD cell lines, particularly in A549 and PC-9. Next, we used three specific siRNA targeting <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic>, and one of them could reduce the <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> expression in A549 and PC-9 cell lines (Figs. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A-C). The CCK8 (Figs. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>D-E) and colony formation assays (Figs. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>F-G) and EdU analysis (Figs. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>H-I) indicated that <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> depletion inhibited LUAD cell proliferation, respectively. The transwell assays indicated that the depletion of <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> inhibited LUAD cell migration (Figs. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>J-K). These results suggest that <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> may function as tumor oncogenes in LUAD.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Numerous transcriptomic and genomic investigations have been undertaken to unravel the prognostic outlook of lung cancer and pinpoint potential biomarkers for prognosis<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Therefore, multiple efficacious prognostic markers are now positioned for incorporation into the clinical management of lung cancer. These strides hold the potential to augment our capability to foresee outcomes and customize more individualized and effective therapeutic strategies for individuals with lung cancer.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Nonetheless, given the highly heterogeneous nature of LUAD, the predominant type of lung cancer, the challenge lies in comprehensively understanding and addressing its diversity.</p><p>Previous studies have predominantly relied on transcriptomics to investigate RNA expression in tumor tissues, but they may not accurately capture variations in gene expression among distinct cells within the tissue. The advent of single-cell sequencing has provided a breakthrough in discerning changes in gene expression at the cellular level<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Thus, leveraging advancements in sequencing technology enables a more precise characterization of the TME in LUAD. This approach holds promise for improved clinical outcomes in cancer patients by identifying specific tumor biomarkers, it allows for more accurate diagnosis and the development of individualized treatment plans, potentially leading to better treatment efficacy<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>.</p><p>This study employed a comprehensive approach to analyze the TME of LUAD patients. We successfully identified lung tumor cells and explored potential trajectories involving the differentiation of lung epithelial cells into tumor cells through CNV analysis. Our analysis identified several genes closely associated with tumor cell differentiation: <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, <italic>JUNB</italic>, <italic>BAMBI</italic>, <italic>THUMPD3-AS1</italic>, <italic>SPINK1</italic>, <italic>EGR1</italic>, <italic>ATF3</italic>, <italic>GEM</italic>, <italic>FOSB</italic>, <italic>SERPINH1</italic>, <italic>DNAJA4</italic>, <italic>MSLN</italic>, <italic>KRT19</italic>, <italic>TMSB4X</italic>, <italic>OCIAD2</italic>, <italic>SRD5A3</italic>, <italic>TPPP3</italic>, <italic>TUBA1A</italic>, <italic>FOXJ1</italic>, and <italic>RSPH1</italic>. Previous researches have explored the mechanism of action and prognostic value of <italic>JUNB</italic><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <italic>BAMBI</italic><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <italic>ATF3</italic><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <italic>MSLN</italic><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <italic>KRT19</italic><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <italic>SPINK1</italic><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and <italic>EGR1</italic><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> in NSCLC. This suggests that the genes identified through our cell trajectory analysis might play a crucial role in driving LUAD development. However, to validate their functional significance, further <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are warranted.</p><p>Upon further subdivision of the tumor cells, we successfully identified four distinct tumor subgroups. The involvement of these tumor subgroups in distinct biological processes highlights a substantial degree of heterogeneity among them. This diversity underscores the complexity and varied nature of biological processes within the context of the identified tumor subgroups.</p><p>The C0 subgroup of tumor cells identified by us is upregulated in the <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;</italic> signal pathway, which indicates that it may be related to the early immune response of the tumor. In the initial phases of tumors, <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;</italic> is acknowledged as a tumor suppressor, impeding proliferation and triggering apoptosis<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. <italic>IRF1</italic> was significantly activated in C0 tumor cell subsets. A transcriptional regulator and tumor suppressor, the protein encoded by the <italic>IRF1</italic> gene activates genes associated with both innate and acquired immune responses<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. As a tumor suppressor, it can inhibit tumor cell growth and stimulate immune response against these cells<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>. In our study, high levels of IRF1 activation may be associated with an early tumor immune response. Max-like protein X (<italic>MLX</italic>) was significantly activated in C1 tumor cell subsets. Heterodimers with Mad proteins are formed by the gene products of <italic>MLX</italic>, and they play a role in proliferation, determination, and differentiation. This may be related to the active proliferation of tumor cells. A research suggests an association between <italic>MLX</italic> and the initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. The C2 subgroup of tumor cells we identified is upregulated in <italic>KRAS</italic> signaling pathway. Researches disclosed that when the carcinogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> signaling pathway is activated, it promotes inhibitory cytokines and chemokines secretion in alveolar cells, thus affecting the recruitment and polarization of various immune cells, shaping the inhibitory TME, which is conducive to the tumor development<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>. <italic>ETS2</italic> was significantly activated in C2 tumor cell subsets. <italic>ETS2</italic> is a transcription factor and proto-oncogene that regulates development, apoptosis, and telomerase.</p><p>The oncogenic role of <italic>ETS2</italic> is substantiated by evidence in bladder cancer<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. There is also evidence suggesting that <italic>ETS2</italic> mediates the formation of osteosarcoma by GOF (gain-of-function) mutants of <italic>p53</italic>, leading to increased lung metastatic ability<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>. This observation suggests a close correlation between the onset and progression of the disease in patients with early-stage tumors. The C3 subgroup of tumor cells we identified is upregulated in the EMT pathway, which may indicate the tendency of cell proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis. Moreover, we found that only the C3 group displayed a marked association with poor prognosis in early-stage LUAD patients. Therefore, further exploring C3 markers may help us find therapeutic targets for patients with early LUAD.</p><p>We crossed genes upregulated in tumor cells to identify effective prognostic markers with those upregulated in LUAD tissue. Identified as prognostic biomarkers for LUAD, <italic>KRT8</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> underwent follow-up experiments for verification. Gene expression data confirms the accuracy of our analysis. Although additional research and clinical trials are imperative for confirmation, published studies support the prognostic potential of these two genes for LUAD.</p><p>For example, <italic>KRT8</italic> is a notable member belonging to the keratin family, and its products usually dimerize with <italic>KRT18</italic> to form intermediate filaments in simple monolayer epithelial cells, which is vital for maintaining cell structural integrity, signal transduction, and cell differentiation. A study identified <italic>KRT8</italic> as a potential novel biomarker for LUAD, showcasing its role in fostering metastasis and triggering EMT through <italic>NF-&#x003ba;B</italic> signaling<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. Previous research has established a link between high <italic>KRT8</italic> expression and a poor prognosis for LUAD patients<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. Integrating our findings, we observed that knocking down <italic>KRT8</italic> in A549 and PC9 cell lines resulted in the suppression of tumor cell proliferation and invasion. This also preliminarily confirms the accuracy of our bioinformatics analysis.</p><p>The tetraspan plasma membrane protein <italic>PERP</italic> (<italic>p53</italic> apoptosis effector related to <italic>PMP22</italic>) is a lesser-known transcriptional target of <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>p63</italic><xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>. PERP is highly expressed in lung cancer. Stable knockdown of <italic>PERP</italic> expression induced death of CL1-5 and A549 lung cancer cells<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>. However, the <italic>PERP</italic> expression in our experiments is completely different at the RNA and protein levels, which warrants further investigation. The high-risk group of patients with LUAD was significantly enriched in the E2F targets, G2M checkpoint, glycolysis, and the EMT. All of these factors are intricately linked to the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells, and we have screened some drug candidates for these properties. For example, alvocidib and purvalanol-a may function as a CDK inhibitor to inhibit tumor proliferation and metastasis.</p><p>Our findings highlight the potential of these candidate genes for both predicting patient prognosis and accurately discriminating between benign and malignant lung tissues. Moreover, the predictive model we developed demonstrates robust differentiation and accuracy, as evidenced by its performance on the training and the external test sets, indicative of its stability and practical utility. Compared to previous studies, such as Yang <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, which focused on fibroblasts and their impact on LUAD progression, our study uniquely integrates single-cell and bulk transcriptomic analyses to explore epithelial cell transformation and tumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, while studies like Xiao <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> and Kim <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> identified circulating biomarkers, we focused on LUAD tissue-specific markers and their functional validation, offering new insights into tumor biology and potential clinical applications. Nevertheless, certain limitations in our study should be acknowledged. This study utilized a relatively small sample size of 20 paired lung cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissues for downstream validations, including RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. While these results provide initial insights, we recognize that the statistical power of these analyses is limited. Future studies will involve a larger cohort to validate and strengthen the robustness of these findings. Moreover, the availability of RNA-seq data was limited. To unveil the broader applicability of microenvironmental features in LUAD, it is imperative to gather additional single-cell data. Finally, although we examined and validated six potential biomarkers at the mRNA level, their practical use requires further experimental and clinical studies.</p><p>In summary, our study aimed to characterize the TME of LUAD. Our comprehensive exploration of the heterogeneity among lung tumor cells is noteworthy. Additionally, we have successfully developed a prognostic model grounded in two candidate prognostic markers for LUAD. Our findings shed light on LUAD heterogeneity and offer a theoretical basis for prognostic stratification in LUAD.</p></sec><sec id="SM0" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supplementary figure and tables.</p></caption><media xlink:href="jcav16p1397s1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by The Medical Science and Technology Project of Zhejiang Province (2024KY284).</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>ZKY, TY, and SZJ designed the study; SZJ, JLC, WBC, WS, HL, LYX, WGX, SWB, HXN, LZY, and SCC performed the experiments and statistical analysis.
