The international guidelines recommend daily screening for delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most commonly used methods for assessing delirium. This study aimed to identify barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice. This was a hospital-based Cross-Sectional study. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. 72 ICU doctors were randomly selected. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Descriptive data were presented, and the chi-squared test was used to determine the associations among variables. Statistical significance was set at
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. More than 70% of the doctors were &#x02264; 30 years of age and female. A total of 69.4% of the participants had &#x0003c; 1year of experience. In total, 94.4% of the participants worked in medical ICUs. Less than 20% of the doctors used delirium assessment tools, with a statistically significant difference based on experience (
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=0.012). Delirium was not regularly assessed in 13.9% of the patients. Non-pharmacological management was applied by 76.4% of doctors, and communication with patients was the most frequent (75%). Haloperidol was the most commonly used drug (83.3%). A total of 40.3% of doctors did not stop delirium medication on ICU discharge. A regular delirium assessment was performed. However, the use of validated assessment tools is uncommon. Nonpharmacological management of delirium is important and is mostly performed. Our doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms of delirium, and almost half of them did not stop the medications on ICU discharge. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients are important.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Delirium</kwd><kwd>CAM-</kwd><kwd>ICDSC</kwd><kwd>critically ill patients</kwd><kwd>ICU</kwd><kwd>current practice</kwd><kwd>Intensive Care Units</kwd><kwd>Doctors.ICU</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>No funding was applied.</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="version-changes"><sec sec-type="version-changes"><label>Revised</label><title>Amendments from Version 3</title><p>Age and years of experience were expressed as mean&#x000a0;and SD.

</sup> Prolonged delirium in the ICU is considered a risk factor for developing post-intensive care syndrome, which is characterized by worsened or new impairments in cognitive, physical, and mental health.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup> Acute delirium can persist for a few hours; however, it can persist for weeks to months after hospital discharge.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</sup> Clinically, delirium can be hyperactive or hypoactive. In the hyperactive form, agitation is prominent, with frequent aggression and risk of self-harm. In the hypoactive form, the patient presents with a low level of consciousness, which is usually prostrate and uncommunicative. A mixed form may also occur with alternation between the two poles.

</sup> In Sudan, no studies have been conducted in the ICU, particularly regarding delirium. This study assessed the current status of knowledge and practice of ICU doctors about delirium. The reasons why this study was developed were to identify the barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice among doctors in Sudan. No similar study was done in Sudan and little is known about Sudanese doctors ICU practice for delirium. This study involved military hospitals in Khartoum, however the types of patients involved citizens.

</sup> Doctors and nurses were the direct healthcare providers for critically ill patients. In addition to nurses, doctors were involved in delirium assessment and reporting as mentioned by Pisani MA et al.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup> Lack of awareness among staff was reported as one of the individual barriers.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup> An issue to be highlighted in this study was the lack of awareness of Sudanese doctors about delirium assessment tools. Moreover, the ICU staff doctors are mostly young (&#x0003c; 30 years) and inexperienced (&#x0003c; 2 years). This study had put light on that point about the working staff in governmental hospitals in Sudan.</p><p>Depending only on signs and symptoms to assess delirium was a common practice among Sudanese doctors. This non protocol-based practice was commonly used by the participants. Society of Critical Care Medicine recommended delirium assessment for all patients in the ICU through the use of a validated assessment instrument.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup> However, in our study, most doctors (76.4%) had not used any specific tool for delirium assessment and relied on signs and symptoms alone without a specific protocol. As in the study by Depetris et al., 57% of doctors did not use any specific tool for delirium assessment.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup> Delirium was usually assessed using either the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC).
<sup>
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</sup> Although the usefulness of the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) for delirium detection has been documented in recent studies,
<sup>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</sup> only 18.1% of our participants used CAM-ICU for delirium assessment. Nevertheless, ICDSC was used by only 1.4% of the doctors. Interestingly, in a systematic review, the CAM-ICU was the tool used for assessing delirium in 65% of delirium clinical trials, while the ICDSC was used in only 6% of the trials.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</sup> In a meta-analysis study, both the CAM-ICU and ICDSC could be used to screen for delirium and diagnose it. However, the study favored CAM-ICU as ICDSC showed lower specificity and sensitivity than CAM-ICU.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</sup> This was the case among our study participants, as only 1.4% used the ICDSC in assessing delirium, while 18.1% used the CAM-ICU tool. Comparatively, in a national multi-center study in China, 34% of doctors used delirium tools; of these, CAM-ICU was the most commonly used (83%) tool.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</sup> Nevertheless, in another study, CAM-ICU was used by 27.5% of doctors, while ICDSC was used by 5%.

</p><p>Presence of delirium among ICU patients must be assessed every 8 hours or at least every 12 hours.

<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</sup> Less than half of the ICU doctors (40.3%) in our study assessed delirium every 8-12 hours, which was the practice in 60% of the clinical trials of delirium, as reported by Colantuoni et al. Furthermore, 45.8% of our doctors assessed delirium daily, which was higher than that reported (35%) by Colantuoni et al.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</sup> Only 13.9% of our doctors had no regular assessments for delirium; this was the case for 30% of physicians in a multinational study.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup> Among our study participants, one of the reasons for irregular delirium assessment was increased workload. This issue has been interpreted as an environmental barrier, especially among ICU staff.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup> This issue was addressed in a study recommended that, in such case of limited resources, delirium management strategies may be prioritized for patients with high risk of delirium.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup> In our study, the association between ICU doctors&#x02019; practice and their years of experience was studied. A statistically significant difference (
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=0.012) was found in delirium assessment. Contrary to the study by Wang et al., there was no statistically significant difference (
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=0.074) between experienced and less-experienced clinicians.

</sup>
</p><p>Delirium preventive measures are important for all ICU patients.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup> This was the case for most of our doctors; however, two doctors reported that they had not conducted such measures unless the patient had developed signs and symptoms of delirium.</p><p>The non-pharmacological approach to delirium management (treatment and/or prevention) is the preferred approach.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</sup> It was the first-line choice for 76.4% of the doctors in our study, which was higher than the percentage (22.5%) reported by Depetris et al.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup> Communication with ICU patients to prevent confusion was the most frequent nonpharmacological approach applied by ICU doctors in our study (75%). This practice involved frequent reorientation of the patients and allowing relatives to come and talk to their patients. This approach was discussed in a systematic review by Deemer et al. assessing early cognitive interventions for delirium in ICU patients.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup> Moreover, participation of family members in delirium prevention strategies could be complementary to the communication interventions performed by doctors and nurses.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup> In our study, this approach of using family member support was practiced by a single doctor. Sleep and circadian rhythm regulation among ICU patients was a targeted therapy approach for these patients
<sup>
<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</sup>; however, it was applied by only 18.1% of our doctors. Another important risk factor for delirium was the use of benzodiazepines.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</sup> Midazolam is the most commonly used sedative for ICU patients, prescribed as high as 72%&#x02013;90.5% of Benzodiazepines.

<sup>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</sup> Hence, reducing their use is considered an important non-pharmacological approach for the prevention of delirium in critically ill patients.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</sup> However, among our ICU doctors, only 6.9% adopted a reduction in benzodiazepines. Surprisingly, Benzodiazepines were used by 20% of our doctors to manage delirium and midazolam was one of the agents used by clinicians in China (31%) for treating delirium.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</sup> This issue needs to be addressed because the use of Benzodiazepines for patients with delirium worsens the case and their use should be reduced.

</p><p>Based on a systematic review by Barbateskovic et al., evidence for the use of pharmacological interventions in the management and prevention of delirium is sparse or poor.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</sup> Nonetheless, this approach is not superior to delirium management.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</sup> The pharmacological approach for delirium treatment was used as the first-line management in 22.2% of our study participants. This was higher than reported (2.5%) in a multi-national study.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup> Antipsychotics were the most commonly used agents (69.4%) among our study doctors. Haloperidol was the most commonly used agent among ICU doctors (83.3%) for delirium treatment. This was consistent with a cohort study that used haloperidol alone in combination with clonidine.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, studies have reported that haloperidol use was the highest in patients with delirium (30%, 43.3%).

</sup> The second most commonly used agent in our study was olanzapine (5.6%), similar to that reported (5.9%) by Swan et al.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> In contrast, quetiapine and risperidone were used by only 1.4% of our study participants, which was much lower than the frequencies reported by Swan et al. (12.7% and 5% respectively).

</p><p>Not to forget that, delirium clinically has two states; hyperactive state mostly characterized by agitation, besides the hypoactive state,
<sup>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</sup> our study assessed current practice of doctors towards agitation treatment. More than half of the study participants (54.2%) prescribed antipsychotics for agitation treatment, while 33.3% prescribed Benzodiazepines. This practice of our doctors was not in line with recommended treatments, as Benzodiazepines were considered treatment agents for agitation.
<sup>

</p><p>Continuation of delirium medication after ICU discharge was common (50.2%), as per a previous study.

<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</sup> Of our doctors, 40.3% had not stopped delirium medications on discharge, which was lower than that reported above.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</sup> However, continuation of such medications beyond the hospital stay could lead to harmful and deleterious events, and medication reconciliation is crucial in such cases.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>

</p><p>The limitations of our study were the lack of comparison of doctors practice to nurses practice. Doctors and nurses were the direct healthcare providers for critically ill patients and nurses play crucial rule in ICU practice. Involving nurses would give a complete picture about this issue. Furthermore, the data collection tool was not validated through Cronbach test of reliability. Although this study was a multi-center study, selection bias might be a risk as we focused on the Hospitals of the Military section as they were bigger and more populated hospitals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec20"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Less than half of ICU doctors assessed delirium every 8-12 hours. Non-pharmacological preventive measures were applied by the majority of participants (976.4%). Communication with patients is important for delirium prevention, as was done by most of the study participants. However, the involvement of family members in communicating with ICU patients is an important approach; yet, it is only applied by one doctor. Delirium assessment tools were used by less than 20% of the ICU doctors. Delirium may fluctuate between agitation and hypoactive states. More than half of the ICU doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms. This was not the case; sedation is the preferred approach for agitated patients. Only 33.3% of the participants were prescribed Benzodiazepines to treat agitation. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients must be conducted to reduce the use of these medications after hospital discharge.</p><p>Instead of using signs and symptoms alone, ICU staff should focus on the use of delirium assessment tools. Non-pharmacological preventive measures must be implemented for all ICU patients, especially those with a high risk of developing delirium. The involvement of family members in communicating with ICU patients should be encouraged as a complementary approach to prevent delirium. A more frequent assessment of delirium is desirable among healthcare staff: 8 hours or 12 hours instead of once-daily assessment. Delirium may fluctuate between agitation and hypoactive states. Treatments for each form must be established by ICU doctors.

Despite international guidelines recommending daily delirium screening, fewer than 20% of doctors utilized validated assessment tools, with their use significantly associated with clinical experience. Non-pharmacological management strategies were commonly employed, while haloperidol was the most frequently prescribed medication. Additionally, nearly half of the physicians did not discontinue delirium medications upon ICU discharge. This topic is clinically significant, the methodology is clear, and the manuscript is well-structured. I hope the following comments will help further enhance its quality:

The authors found that formal assessment of delirium was uncommon. &#x000a0;Nonpharmacological management was commonly used, but pharmacological management was also frequent.</p><p> The topic is potentially an important one, as difficulties recognizing delirium are common across a number of settings, and are associated with a number of adverse patient and healthcare system outcomes. However, the methods are often not specified in sufficient detail, and the contribution of this particular study to the existing literature is not well delineated.</p><p> The background is generally well done, but a bit disorganized in a few spots. &#x000a0;In particular, the statement "Furthermore, delirium is associated with long-term cognitive impairments." seems out of placer from the rest of the material in the paragraph, and would be better placed with other material about adverse consequences. &#x000a0;Similarly, the statement "From another perspective, patients with delirium are more likely to bear increased healthcare costs than those without delirium." could be combined with material about adverse consequences rather than a separate paragraph. &#x000a0;Reference 18 is for burn patients and it is not clear that these findings are applicable to the ICU setting. &#x000a0;And noting that the mixed form of delirium is actually the most common would be helpful.</p><p> Most importantly, the background does not clearly lay out the case for the current study. &#x000a0;There have been multiple publications in the literature noting that delirium is often missed by clinicians, that assessment is often not performed, and many clinicians lack sufficient understanding of delirium. &#x000a0;Given these previous studies, why is this study needed? &#x000a0;Are there particular aspects of practice in Sudan that are different from previous studies? &#x000a0;If so, this should be more clearly delineated to show the importance of this investigation.</p><p> Several aspects of the methods are not sufficiently described. &#x000a0;The setting notes several different types of ICUs being studied but these are not delineated. &#x000a0;The stratified random sampling needs to be described more fully. &#x000a0;The questionnaire used for assessing knowledge and practice is not well described - was this a standard questionnaire (in which case it should be referenced)? &#x000a0;Or a questionnaire developed by the investigators (in which case the questions should be provided in detail, along with the validation of the questionnaire for adequately assessing the outcomes of interest)? Why were the predictor variables selected, and are these 4 sufficient for describing the associations in the sample? &#x000a0;Is the chosen sample size formula appropriate for a series of chi-square tests? &#x000a0;</p><p> The results are generally straightforward. &#x000a0;However, in the description of the sample, did all of the randomized participants complete the questionnaire? &#x000a0;Or were there refusals? &#x000a0;A description of the flow of participants (or a flow diagram, if it is complicated) would be helpful. In addition, the sample was overwhelmingly young, inexperienced, and female. &#x000a0;Is this typical of ICU doctors in Sudan? &#x000a0;Or were there biases in the sample?</p><p> When an ICU doctor determined delirium based on "signs and symptoms", does this mean that DSM-5 (or a comparable system) was used? &#x000a0;Or does this mean an informal assessment with no specific criteria?</p><p> Similarly, what does "communication with the patient to prevent confusion" mean? &#x000a0;Does this mean established protocols such as frequent reorientation, or is this an informal communication without a specific protocol? &#x000a0;Such information is helpful in being able to understand and replicate the study findings.</p><p> It would be helpful to present odds ratios from the chi-square tests to indicate the direction of the associations, rather than just p values.</p><p> The discussion would benefit from more depth. &#x000a0;There is a rather extensive literature on the recognition of delirium by physicians, the barriers to recognition, and attitudes towards management. &#x000a0;However, the discussion only references a few studies (often a comparison to just 1 other study) rather than providing an overview of previous findings. &#x000a0;Furthermore, the authors often only compare their results to a previous study, but do not place this in context - what does it mean if their results are similar or different from previous studies? &#x000a0;Does this have implications for the recognition and management of delirium generally, or does this show specific aspects of management of delirium in Sudanese hospitals?</p><p> Under limitations, the authors should not just note the limitations, but also how these impact the study - do these affect the reliability or generalizability of the findings? &#x000a0;Also under limitations, is the military hospital setting a limitation? &#x000a0;Are the patient characteristics for military hospitals significantly different from the patient characteristics in non-military hospitals in Sudan, the way that there are differences in other countries?</p><p> Overall, I think that this manuscript has the potential to make a contribution to the literature, particularly since delirium and other cognitive disorders are not well studied in settings outside of a few developed countries. &#x000a0;However, more details are needed in several places to fully understand the study, be able to replicate their processes, and place the findings in context.</p><p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?</p><p>Partly</p><p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>No</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>Delirium phenomenology, diagnosis, and clinical trials</p><p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to state that I do not consider it to be of an acceptable scientific standard, for reasons outlined above.</p></body><sub-article article-type="response" id="comment12541-295363"><front-stub><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Abd El-Raheem</surname><given-names>Ghada</given-names></name><aff>Imperial Hospital, Soba University Hospital, Military Hospital, Sudan</aff></contrib></contrib-group><author-notes><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>
