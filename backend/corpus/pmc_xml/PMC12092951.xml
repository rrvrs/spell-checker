Specifically, the study aims to assess its impact on the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI), wound dehiscence, the need for secondary suturing, and the duration of hospital stay. Additionally, the study seeks to determine whether the observed SSIs are primarily attributable to intra-abdominal infections or are a result of hospital-acquired cross infections.</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>A prospective comparative study was conducted on 60 patients diagnosed with peritonitis who underwent emergency laparotomy. They were randomly assigned into two groups of 30 patients each: Group A (with subcutaneous negative suction drain) and Group B (without drain). In Group A, drain fluid was analyzed for infection characteristics, while wound discharge from both groups was assessed microbiologically, where present.</p><p>Results</p><p>Group A included 21 males (70%) and nine females (30%), while Group B had 26 males (86%) and four females (13%). Midline vertical incisions were used in 90% of cases, with the remaining 10% receiving right paramedian incisions. Discharge from the incision site was observed in five patients (16%) in Group A and 13 patients (43%) in Group B (p = 0.024). SSIs occurred in five patients (16.67%) in Group A and in eight patients (26%) in Group B. Seroma formation was observed in five patients (16.67%) in Group B, but none in Group A. No significant differences were noted in wound dehiscence, need for secondary suturing, or duration of hospital stay between the groups.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Subcutaneous negative suction drainage significantly reduced the incidence of SSI, seroma formation, and discharge from the incision site following emergency laparotomy for peritonitis. This may lower the risk of wound complications and postoperative morbidity. Further randomized controlled trials are recommended to validate these findings.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>emergency laparotomy</kwd><kwd>peritonitis</kwd><kwd>subcutaneous drains</kwd><kwd>subcutaneous negative pressure closure</kwd><kwd>surgical site infection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Surgical site infections (SSIs) and delayed wound healing are frequently observed following abdominal surgeries for secondary peritonitis of varied etiologies, such as perforated appendicitis, gastroduodenal ulcers, or enteric perforations. The severity of wound complications may differ based on the underlying cause, degree of contamination, and host factors [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The development of an SSI significantly impacts patient morbidity, mortality, hospital stay, healthcare costs, and patient satisfaction [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>SSIs remain one of the most common healthcare-associated infections, accounting for approximately 20% of all HAIs. Recent estimates suggest that 2% to 5% of patients undergoing inpatient surgery develop an SSI despite advances in infection prevention strategies [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis and thorough intraoperative peritoneal lavage are well-established measures to reduce infection risk, the technique of wound closure also plays a critical role.</p><p>While seroma formation is more frequently associated with fatty or dependent anatomical areas, it can still occur in midline laparotomies, particularly in emergency cases involving peritonitis and subcutaneous dissection. It may lead to further wound complications such as abscess formation, calcification, and poor cosmetic outcomes, including unsatisfactory scar appearance. In cases of SSI, a burst abdomen poses a major clinical concern. Re-closure may impair respiratory function, while leaving the wound open increases the risk of nosocomial infections [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that using negative suction in the subcutaneous plane reduces infection by effectively evacuating contaminated fluid and seromas [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Negative pressure also promotes wound healing by lowering the bacterial load, providing a moist and protected environment, reducing peripheral oedema, enhancing circulation, and accelerating granulation tissue formation and epithelialization [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Given this background, the present study was undertaken to compare the effectiveness of subcutaneous negative suction drainage versus conventional wound closure in emergency laparotomy for peritonitis, focusing on the frequency of SSI, wound dehiscence, the need for secondary suturing, and the duration of hospital stay.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study design and setting</p><p>This was a randomized, prospective, comparative study conducted in the Department of General Surgery at Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Bengaluru. The study period spanned from November 2018 to October 2020. Prior to commencement, the study protocol received approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee of KIMS.</p><p>Study population</p><p>The study included adult patients aged 18 years and above who were diagnosed with peritonitis and underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy at KIMS Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to inclusion in the study.</p><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</p><p>All patients above the age of 18 years who were admitted with clinically and radiologically confirmed secondary peritonitis, due to causes such as gastrointestinal perforation, appendicitis, or enteric fever, and were scheduled for emergency exploratory laparotomy at KIMS Hospital were recruited into the study after obtaining informed consent. Patients were excluded if they were below 18 years of age, were immunocompromised (including those with HIV, uncontrolled diabetes, those on long-term steroid therapy, or those undergoing chemotherapy), were pregnant, or required an ileostomy or colostomy during the surgical procedure. Patients requiring intraoperative formation of stomas (ileostomy or colostomy) were excluded from the study.</p><p>Grouping and sample size</p><p>A total of 60 patients (calculated using MedCalc&#x000ae; Statistical Software, MedCalc Software Ltd., Ostend, Belgium) who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned into two groups(simple randomization technique, sealed envelope method), with 30 patients in each group. Group A comprised patients whose abdominal closure involved placement of a subcutaneous negative suction drain using a Romo Vac No. 16 device (Romsons Group Private Limited, Agra, India). Group B included patients who underwent abdominal closure without the use of a subcutaneous drain. The sample size was determined based on a previous study by Kagita et al. [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which reported SSI rates of 12.5% in the intervention group and 69.4% in the control group. With a type I error of 1%, a power of 95%, and a 10% buffer to account for non-responsiveness, the final calculated sample size was 30 patients per group.</p><p>Preoperative and operative management</p><p>All patients received standard preoperative care, including resuscitation, nasogastric decompression, correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and empirical administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics consisting of a third-generation cephalosporin, an aminoglycoside, and metronidazole. The diagnosis of peritonitis was established based on clinical features, laboratory investigations, and imaging studies such as abdominal and chest X-rays to detect signs like free intraperitoneal air, bowel dilatation, or paralytic ileus, which were interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings. The majority of patients underwent surgery within six to 12 hours of admission. Emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed under strict aseptic precautions by experienced surgeons from the same unit of the department. After appropriate intraoperative management and peritoneal lavage using normal saline, closure of the rectus sheath was accomplished with non-absorbable Loop PDS 1-0 sutures. In Group A, a single Romo Vac No. 16 (Romsons Group Private Limited, Agra, India) subcutaneous drain was inserted in the lower subcutaneous plane and brought out through a separate stab incision lateral to the main surgical wound. No intraperitoneal drains were used in either group. The skin was then closed using either Ethilon 2-0 mattress sutures or staples. In Group B, the abdominal closure was performed in a standard fashion without insertion of a subcutaneous drain.</p><p>Postoperative assessment</p><p>Postoperative evaluation focused on identifying SSIs, wound dehiscence, need for secondary suturing, duration of hospital stay, and occurrence of seroma formation. SSIs were diagnosed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In Group A, a subcutaneous Romo Vac drain was used, and daily output was recorded. Samples from the subcutaneous drain fluid were sent for culture and sensitivity testing on postoperative day 2 or day 3 and at the time of drain removal (when output was &#x0003c;25 mL for two consecutive days). In Group B, if any wound discharge was observed, it was similarly cultured to assess superficial infection. These assessments focused solely on subcutaneous contamination and were not intended to represent intra-abdominal pathology. To determine the source of infection, culture results of intra-abdominal fluid and wound discharge were compared on postoperative day 5 or day 6. Seromas were managed through drainage and antiseptic dressings, whereas wound dehiscence was managed conservatively with secondary suturing after sufficient granulation tissue formation.</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>All data were analyzed using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, IBM Corp., Version 22, Armonk, NY). Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and proportions, and comparisons were made using the chi-square test. Continuous variables were expressed as mean values with standard deviations and analyzed using the independent t-test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 60 patients diagnosed with peritonitis and undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy at Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences were enrolled in this study.

This is consistent with studies such as those by Gupta and Kumar [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Owens and Stoessel [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which reported reduced wound complications with the use of negative pressure wound therapy. Vashist et al. also noted improved wound outcomes when negative suction was used for abdominal wall closure in sepsis [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>When comparing the etiology of wound infections, we found that hospital-acquired cross-infections were more prevalent than infections originating from the peritoneal cavity. Only 3% of infections in Group A and 10% in Group B were linked to intra-abdominal sources, while 13% and 16%, respectively, were due to nosocomial transmission. This finding reinforces the importance of rigorous postoperative infection control practices, especially in emergency surgical settings.</p><p>Regarding wound dehiscence and need for secondary suturing, although Group A had a lower rate (3.33%) than Group B (6.67%), the difference was not statistically significant. Chowdri et al. reported similar observations in obese patients, advocating the use of subcutaneous drains to reduce dehiscence and infection risk [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>One of the most noteworthy results in our study was the complete absence of seroma formation in Group A, compared to 16.7% in Group B. This supports the evidence from Harish et al., who documented significantly reduced seroma rates in patients managed with subcutaneous suction drainage [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Sumi et al. also reported reduced seroma and SSI rates in patients with colorectal perforation who received subcutaneous closed suction drains [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The incidence of SSI was lower in Group A (16.67%) than in Group B (26.67%). Although not statistically significant, this trend aligns with the findings of Gupta and Kumar [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], who showed a protective effect of suction drains in abdominal surgeries. Similar benefits of negative pressure closure in reducing SSIs have been reported by Stannard et al. [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Willy et al. [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], who emphasized its clinical value in high-risk surgical wounds and contaminated fields.</p><p>As for hospital stay, our study found a mean duration of 10.8 days in Group A and 11.7 days in Group B, which was not statistically significant. This contrasts with the findings of Naik et al. [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], who observed earlier discharge and faster recovery in patients receiving subcutaneous negative pressure closure. However, hospital stay is multifactorial and can be significantly influenced by the severity of the primary pathology, systemic complications, and comorbidities, which may explain the lack of significant difference observed between the two groups.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings support the use of subcutaneous negative suction drains in emergency laparotomy wounds. They significantly reduce wound discharge, seroma formation, and SSIs. Although they may not significantly affect hospital stay or dehiscence rates, the overall trend favors improved wound outcomes with drains. These results are consistent with multiple prior studies and advocate for the routine use of drains in contaminated surgical wounds.</p><p>This study has several limitations. Firstly, the sample size was relatively small, with only 60 patients enrolled, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Secondly, the study was conducted at a single tertiary care center, which may introduce institutional bias. Thirdly, microbiological differentiation between intra-abdominal and hospital-acquired infections was based solely on culture reports without molecular typing, which may affect diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, due to the emergency nature of surgeries, intraoperative contamination and surgical technique were not fully standardized. Finally, the short duration of follow-up confined to the inpatient period may have missed delayed SSIs or complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Subcutaneous negative suction drainage facilitates improved wound healing by actively reducing bacterial load and eliminating dead space. In our study, patients who underwent emergency laparotomy for peritonitis and received subcutaneous negative suction drains demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of SSIs, seroma formation, and wound discharge.</p><p>By minimizing postoperative wound complications, this intervention has the potential to reduce overall patient morbidity. However, to substantiate these findings further and establish definitive clinical guidelines, larger multicentric randomized controlled trials are recommended.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
