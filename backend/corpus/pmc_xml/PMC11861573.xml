The connection between the color blue and Monday is in the emotional stage, which is presented as emotional anger. The third Monday in January is currently known as the most depressing day of the year. Speaker Cliff Arnall was the first to declare that day in 2014. The theory says that this is the time of the year when respiratory diseases are common, the day is shorter, the weather conditions are worse, and the time when people are burdened with guilt about whether they will achieve their New Year&#x02019;s resolutions.</p></sec><sec id="sec5743"><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of this work was to investigate that on third Monday in January&#x000a0;there were more suicide attempts and that there were more depressive disorders in emergency psychiatric admissions.</p></sec><sec id="sec5744"><title>Methods</title><p>
In the research, we included participants who were examined at the Emergency Psychiatric Admission of the Clinical Hospital Center in Split, in the period from 2019. until 2023. Inclusion criteria were respondents of both sexes, examined in the outpatient clinic on Mondays in January for five years.</p></sec><sec id="sec5745"><title>Results</title><p>There were 198 of them in total. The primary outcome of the research is to determine the occurrence (incidence) of psychological deterioration in patients diagnosed with the anxiety-depressive spectrum. The secondary research outcomes are of a descriptive nature, patient follow-up, examination outcome, and psychiatric heredity.</p></sec><sec id="sec5746"><title>Conclusions</title><p>For now, there are no strong scientific foundations that justify the formula of &#x0201c;the most depressing day&#x0201d; of the year, some scientists believe that it is a marketing trick to achieve higher tourist revenues. However, the post-holiday period can have an impact on individuals.</p></sec><sec id="sec5747"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
