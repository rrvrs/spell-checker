of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF) is crucial for biomass refineries. Herein, we report the unprecedentedly
high efficiency of the nearly complete conversion of biomass-derived
HMF to value-added products, achieving &#x0003e;95% selectivity at &#x02212;0.4
V vs RHE by pairing electrocatalytic reduction and oxidation (PERO)
reactions in a single electrochemical cell. At the cathode, we achieved
99% conversion of HMF to 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) in &#x0223c;99%
yield under mild conditions using a PtRu alloy. At the anode, we observed
99% conversion of HMF, nearly perfect selectivity for the oxidative
product 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), and 100% Faradaic efficiency
on a NiCo(OOH)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> nanosheets electrode.
The kinetic isotope effect demonstrated that the rate-controlled step
was a proton-independent electron transfer process, with minimal impact
from substrate concentration variations. After assembling the synchronous
reaction cell, the PERO of HMF generated high yields of DHMF (94%)
and FDCA (86%), achieving a combined electron efficiency of 131%,
nearly doubling the performance of uncoupled cells. This superior
performance was attributed to the efficient generation of H* on the
PtRu alloy for reduction, alongside the OH* active sites on the NiCo(OOH)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> nanosheets electrode for oxidation. This
research provides a promising strategy for the sustainable electrocatalytic
upgrading of biomass-derived chemicals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pairing electrocatalytic reduction and oxidation</kwd><kwd>biomass-derived

and oxidation technologies,
electrochemical biomass conversion has several pivotal advantages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> First, the reactions can be conducted under ambient temperature
and pressure conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Second, transformation
reactions are driven by an applied potential, obviating the requirement
for chemical reductants/oxidants as well as the imposition of high-pressure
hydrogen or oxygen atmospheres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Third,
electrochemical reduction or oxidation reactions can be strategically
paired with simultaneous and advantageous half-reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> An illustrative example is the oxidation of biomass-derived
5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to produce 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid
(FDCA), which can be coupled with the reduction of water to hydrogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> This simultaneous occurrence of both reactions results in the generation
of valuable products, thereby significantly increasing the overall
efficiency and economic value of the process.</p><p>Electrochemical
reduction has become an appealing and promising
channel for the reductive transformation of HMF, particularly due
to its operation under mild conditions, such as ambient temperature
and pressure, utilizing water as the hydrogen source.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> This approach has been successfully applied to the conversion of
HMF to 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF), achieving notable yields and
high Faradaic efficiency (FE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Selecting catalysts based on previous research and experience and
subsequently designing catalysts suitable for specific reduction reactions
are crucial because they can inspire the exploration of various novel
reaction systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> In electrocatalytic reduction systems, the formation
of adsorbed hydrogen on metal (M) electrodes is a crucial factor influencing
the electrochemical reduction process, determining the outcomes of
various reduction reactions. A typical example is the volcano-type
relationship between the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity
and the strength of the metal&#x02013;hydrogen (M&#x02013;H) bond. Optimal
catalysts for the HER exhibit intermediate M&#x02013;H bond strength,
as illustrated by the volcano plot where the HER activity is plotted
against the M&#x02013;H bond strength (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01135/suppl_file/au4c01135_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Metals with insufficient M&#x02013;H bond strength
fail to accumulate enough adsorbed hydrogen on their surfaces for
effective hydrogen generation. Conversely, the hydrogen atoms are
bonded too firmly when the M&#x02013;H bond is excessively strong,
which prevents them from being released as molecular hydrogen. Metals
such as Pt and Ru, positioned near the optimum center of the volcano
plot, demonstrate an ideal balance: strong enough to sustain significant
hydrogen adsorption yet weak enough to facilitate the release of hydrogen
gas, thereby optimizing HER activity. This concept of optimal M&#x02013;H
bond strength provides insights into the requirements for catalyst
design in the electrochemical reduction of HMF. Specifically, the
mechanism by which an optimum M&#x02013;H bond strength can enhance
HMF conversion needs to be thoroughly investigated, as the balance
of hydrogen adsorption and release underlies both HER and HMF reactivity.
Despite the effectiveness of noble metals such as Pt and Ru, which
conform closely to this optimal bond strength range, their application
can lead to the formation of byproducts. Therefore, the development
of binary catalysts has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
catalytic performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup></p><p>In electrocatalytic reduction, H* is typically
formed at the cathode
and used to hydrogenate unsaturated substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> At the same time, an oxidation reaction takes place at
the anode, often producing low-value products such as oxygen, which
suffer from high overpotentials due to four electron transfers and
slow reaction kinetics. To address this, recent research has focused
on coupled electrosynthesis, which aims to produce valuable products
at the anode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> The electrocatalytic oxidation mechanism of HMF was clarified on
hydroxide, and an FDCA selectivity of 99% was demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> At present, combining half-reactions with the HER has been strategically
employed to maximize the generation of valuable products through electrocatalysis,
thereby improving the energy efficiency of the process. Several such
coupled electrochemical reactions have been successfully executed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> However, the application of coupled half-reactions
has a narrow scope and is significantly underutilized by the broader
synthesis community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> In particular, there
is a lack of research on the coupled reaction of electrocatalytic
reduction and oxidation of biomass-derived platform chemicals.</p><p>In this study, we successfully constructed a high-efficiency pairing
system for HMF reduction and oxidation in one assembled cell. We first
carried out a comparative analysis of the voltammetric behavior and
constant potential HMF reduction of the PtRu alloy to discern any
patterns in how these metals influence the selectivity for HMF reduction.
In addition, different from the methods used for monopolar reduction
or oxidation reported in the literature, a coupled electrolyzer was
constructed by combining the electrocatalytic reduction of HMF to
DHMF and the oxidation of HMF to FDCA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a). Using water as the source for hydrogen
and oxygen, we achieved nearly perfect conversion and over 90% selectivity
on both sides. The FE of the coupled system exceeded 130%, even after
five runs. The high efficiency of the simultaneous reduction and oxidation
of HMF exhibited by the electrocatalytic system was primarily due
to the generation of H* on the PtRu alloy and OH* on the NiCo(OOH)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> nanosheets, as confirmed by in situ electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS), and kinetic isotope effects (KIE). This pairing system would
significantly improve the efficiency of biomass refining.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) Coupled

microwave-assisted strategy with a microwave power of 1300 W, which
is a simple and swift synthesis process. The as-synthesized PtRu alloy
was then used as a cathode for the electrocatalytic reduction of HMF.
The crystallographic structure and associated diffraction peaks of
the synthesized PtRu alloy were characterized using X-ray diffraction
(XRD), and the results are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b. The XRD patterns revealed five prominent
peaks at 2&#x003b8; angles of 39.7&#x000b0;, 46.2&#x000b0;, 67.5&#x000b0;, 81.2&#x000b0;,
and 85.7&#x000b0;. The peaks corresponded well to the (111), (200), (220),
(311), and (222) planes of a face-centered cubic structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> The positions of the characteristic peaks for
the PtRu alloy were located between the standard 2&#x003b8; peak positions
of pure Pt (PDF no. 88-2343) and pure Ru (PDF no. 88&#x02013;2333).
This intermediate positioning suggested that the smaller Ru atoms
were incorporated into the Pt lattice, leading to the formation of
a PtRu alloy. This was particularly evident for the (111) plane, which
exhibited a calculated interplanar spacing of 0.225 nm. The sharpness
of these peaks was indicative of large grain sizes and a high degree
of crystallinity, which implied the enhanced atomic order. In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c, the diffractogram
of the NiCo(OOH)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> nanosheets shows characteristic
hydroxide peaks at 11.1&#x000b0;, 22.0&#x000b0;, 33.5&#x000b0;, and 38.8&#x000b0;.
Such well-defined crystallographic features were critical for influencing
the electrocatalytic activity and durability.</p><p>X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was subsequently utilized to characterize the surface
chemical states of the as-synthesized PtRu alloy. The high-resolution
XPS spectrum of Pt 4f for the PtRu alloy, presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>d, exhibited a detailed delineation
into four distinct peaks. A pair of principal peaks attributable to
Pt in its metallic state (Pt<sup>0</sup>) was observed at binding
energies of 71.6 and 74.9 eV. The Ru 3p spectrum, shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>e, featured binding
energies at 461.9 and 464.1 eV, which were mainly attributed to the
metallic state (Ru<sup>0</sup>). For the NiCo(OOH)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> nanosheets, high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni and Co were
obtained. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>f
shows that the peaks at 872.5 and 854.7 eV correspond to the Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> signals, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> Two spin&#x02013;orbit doublets of 795.6 and 780.2 eV were assigned
to Co 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub>, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>g).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup></p><p>To clarify the surface electronic characteristics
of the PtRu alloy,
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to measure the morphology
and structural characteristics of the sample. A representative TEM
image of the PtRu alloy is depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a. The particles within the highly alloyed
sample were found to be on the nanometer scale. High-resolution TEM
(HRTEM) images, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b, revealed distinct lattice fringes with a spacing
of 0.225 nm, which was indicative of the typical (111) plane. Selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a) displayed obvious diffraction rings that
were in complete congruence with the characteristic peaks observed
in the XRD results. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping
images for individual nanoparticles are illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c,d, which demonstrate uniform
distributions of Pt and Ru throughout the particles, with a notable
overlap between the two elements. This homogeneous distribution provided
further evidence of the alloying feature of the PtRu alloy. The nanosheets
on the staggered wires in the NiCo(OOH)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> sample are shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01135/suppl_file/au4c01135_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>. The atomic-level

tests were conducted using a PtRu alloy as the cathode without adding
any reaction substrates to evaluate its electrochemical performance
in different electrolytes. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves and <italic>C</italic><sub>dl</sub> values were obtained to assess the performance
of the PtRu alloy in various electrolytes, as shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01135/suppl_file/au4c01135_si_001.pdf">Figures S3 and S4</ext-link>. The potentiostatic tests also
indicated that the PtRu alloy maintains long-term durability at various

on the HER test results, it was evident that the PtRu alloy exhibited
significant HER performance in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes.
However, under mildly neutral conditions, the HER performance was
somewhat suppressed, which suggested that neutral conditions might
favor the occurrence of HMF reduction reactions.</p><p>Next, the electrocatalytic
reduction of HMF was investigated. Under neutral conditions (0.1 M
PBS containing 1.37 M NaCl, 0.0512 M KCl, 0.101 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.0176 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), the electrocatalytic
reduction of HMF was studied in the presence and absence of HMF. As
shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a,
after adding HMF, the current density in blank PBS electrolyte was
significantly inhibited, indicating that the electrocatalytic reduction
of HMF could restrain the HER. The overpotential and Tafel slope (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b,c) increased after
the addition of HMF, which can be attributed to the adsorption of
HMF on the surface of the PtRu alloy instead of H<sup>+</sup>/H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>. Moreover, the open-circuit potential (OCP)
was measured to monitor changes in the organic adsorbent content within
the inner Helmholtz layer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> Upon injection of HMF,
a significant OCP change of 0.42 V was observed in the PtRu alloy,
suggesting increased adsorption of HMF molecules (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>d). The reaction was then studied
to understand the electrocatalytic reduction process in an H-type
electrocatalytic cell at a constant potential. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>e, HMF conversion
was investigated with various concentrations of HMF, including 0.1,
2, 10, and 20 mM, at a standard temperature (25 &#x000b0;C). HMF was
completely electrocatalytically hydrogenated to obtain DHMF in 10
min with 0.1 mM HMF, and the DHMF selectivity was &#x0223c;100% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>f). When 10 mM HMF

the Bode plots for the HER on the PtRu alloy electrode exhibited prominent

yield on the PtRu alloy at four different potentials of &#x02212;0.2,

applied, the current density was only 5 mA cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>,
corresponding to the initial stage of the linear cycle curve. The
PtRu alloy electrode obtained a low HMF conversion and DHMF yield
of less than 30%. When the applied potential was increased to &#x02212;0.4
V vs RHE, the conversion of HMF was more than two times greater than
that at &#x02212;0.2 V vs RHE, and the yield was as high as 94%. When
the applied potential was increased to &#x02212;0.8 V vs RHE, the HMF
conversion and DHMF yield did not increase further. In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b, the difference between the
HMF conversion and FDCA yield for electrocatalytic oxidation at the
anode is displayed. The anode NiCo(OOH)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> nanosheets showed low HMF conversion and FDCA yield at low potential
(initial potential), indicating that the current was insufficient
to produce efficient oxidation of HMF. When the potential increased
to &#x02212;0.4 V vs RHE, the electrocatalytic oxidation reactivity
was remarkable, and the conversion of HMF suddenly increased 3&#x02013;4
times to 89%, which was much greater than the 26% observed at &#x02212;0.2
V vs RHE, at which point the HMF was completely converted to FDCA.
When the potential reached &#x02212;0.8 V vs RHE, nearly full conversion
of HMF and perfect selectivity of FDCA were achieved. Compared with
the electrocatalytic conversion of HMF in the three-electrode system,
the time required for complete oxidation of HMF in the pairing reaction
increased, but the reduction rate of HMF in the cathode accelerated,
and 95% of the DHMF product was obtained in 1 h. These results showed
that DHMF produced at the cathode was faster than that at the anode
in a short time when the substrate concentration was sufficient. The
electrocatalytic oxidation at the anode was carried out step by step,
and nearly 100% conversion was obtained after 3 h of reaction. The
hydrogenation product DHMF and oxidation product FDCA were obtained
by pairing the electrochemical oxidation and reduction of HMF. After
5 h of pairing, the FE density of the cathode and anode was greater
than 130% at &#x02212;0.4 V vs RHE (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>c). The potential dependent turnover number

of carboxylic acid and alcohol molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> When DFF was added to the electrolyte, HMF and FFCA were detected
over time, further confirming that nonelectrochemical reactions involving
DFF occurred. In contrast, the HMFCA intermediate remained unchanged
under alkaline conditions. Therefore, the oxidation path of HMF to
FDCA primarily involves the formation of HMFCA intermediates, but
also includes the nonelectrochemical oxidation process of the DFF
intermediate (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01135/suppl_file/au4c01135_si_001.pdf">Figure S8</ext-link>).</p><p>To verify
the changes in the rate-controlled steps after the addition
of HMF, the KIEs of the electrocatalytic reduction/oxidation reactions
were measured using H/D isotope substitution tests. KIE refers to
the change in reaction rate when an atom in a reactant was replaced
by its isotope. This occurs if the alteration in reactants does not
counterbalance the change in the transition state. Specifically, according
to transition state theory, the reaction rate will vary if there is
a difference in the ground state vibration energy between the reactants
and the transition state before and after isotope substitution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> In the isotope substitution experiment, buffer
salts were dissolved in H<sub>2</sub>O and D<sub>2</sub>O, and a pairing
reaction was performed after HMF was added. A KIE of &#x0223c;1 for
electrocatalytic reduction was observed at the cathode in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>e, following zero-order
dynamics, indicating that the isotope-substituted bond (O&#x02013;H)
did not change during the determination step. The rate-controlled
step was a proton-independent electron transfer process, and a shift
in the substrate concentration had little effect on the reaction rate.
It was assumed that surface adsorption on the PtRu alloy electrode
was a rate-controlled step during the pairing reaction, which is consistent
with the Tafel slopes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> In contrast, for
the KIE value (&#x0226a;1) for electrocatalytic oxidation in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>f, the oxidation
reaction was actually faster with isotope substitution than without
isotope substitution. As the vibration became slower, the force constant
of the bending vibration became larger during the transition state.
In this case, the difference in the zero-point energy at the transition
state was greater than that at the reactant state, which was an opposite
kinetic isotope effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> The isotope substitution
bond (O&#x02013;H) of the rate-controlled step was not broken when
the transition state changed, which was the second-order kinetic isotope
effect. This was attributed to hybridization or participation in conjugation
(i.e., carbon ions adjacent to the O&#x02013;H/O&#x02013;D bonds). The
magnitude of the isotopic effect was much smaller than that of the
primary KIE, and the transition state was generated late. The inherent
inverse reduction eliminated the isotopic effect at the transition
state. Therefore, it was speculated that the rate-determining step
involves the O&#x02013;H/O&#x02013;D bonds participating in conjugation.
The inverse KIE value was also consistent with the multistep oxidation-addition
mechanism of HMF at the anode. To further explore the multistep oxidation&#x02013;addition
process of electrocatalytic oxidation, the active species of OH* were
investigated using EPR. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>g, the PERO of HMF showed a strong DMPO-OH
signal at 1.55 V vs RHE at the anode. This suggested that the formation
of OH* active sites was the main mechanism for the electrocatalytic
oxidation of HMF on NiCo(OOH)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> nanosheets.
In addition, the degree of OH* adsorption on the anode electrode was
studied using EIS, and Bode plots are presented in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>h,i. On the surface of the
NiCo(OOH)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> electrode, the formation of
adsorbed OH* intermediates occurred, which then interacted with HMF,
a nucleophile, resulting in the production of FDCA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Universality of the Pairing System</title><p>To study the universality

(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>b). This variation
might result from the interchange of adsorbates and ions in the Helmholtz

performed at 25, 35, and 45 &#x000b0;C (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01135/suppl_file/au4c01135_si_001.pdf">Figure S9</ext-link>).

a pairing reaction system
for high-efficiency electrocatalytic HMF reduction and oxidation.
The PtRu alloy electrocatalyst was first synthesized via a solvent-free
microwave-assisted method for high-performance electrocatalytic reduction
of biomass-derived HMF. After the addition of HMF, the bipolarity
conversion rate of HMF was nearly perfect, the conversion rate of
HMF was 98%, and the DHMF yield was 94% at the cathode. The positive
extreme HMF was almost completely transformed, and the FDCA yield
was 86% using NiCo(OOH)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> nanosheets at
the anode. A coupled electrocatalytic oxidation and reduction system
can obtain more than 130% FE, the TON value of the cathode is 790,
and the TON value of the anode is 1721, which is far superior to most
of the previously reported candidates. The isotope substitution tests
revealed that the cathodic reduction reaction was a proton-independent
electron transfer process, while the anodic reaction was a proton-involved
multipole reaction, which also proved that the electrocatalytic oxidation
of HMF was a multistep oxidation mechanism. We clarified the critical
role of H* on the PtRu alloy for reduction and the OH* active sites
on the NiCo(OOH)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> nanosheets electrode
for oxidation. Therefore, coupling the oxidation and reduction reactions
of HMF under cathodic potential control is a feasible solution for
upgrading high-value chemicals. The PERO system was also universal
and ideal for pairing LA reduction || HMF oxidation, LA reduction
|| FF oxidation, and LA reduction || BAE oxidation. The paired system
developed in this work could be beneficial for various biomass refineries.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Controllable Synthesis of the PtRu Alloy</title><p>In a typical

solution B. Afterward, a pretreated Ni foam electrode (1 cm<sup>2</sup>) was placed in 35 mL of the mixed solution. The electrodeposition
was performed using a galvanostatic deposition method on an Autolab
204 workstation. Finally, the Ni foam with the deposited catalysts
was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 &#x000b0;C for 5 h.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>Pairing Reactions</title><p>For reduction reaction, the electrolytes
used included 1 M pKOH solution (pH 13.6), 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (pH 0.38), and 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4). Then, 30 mL of electrolyte
was added to both sides of an H-type cell (50 mL total volume) with
a Nafion 117 membrane. The working electrode was a PtRu alloy on carbon
fiber paper, while a Pt wire (&#x003a6; = 1 mm, 4 cm in length, Shanghai
CH Instruments Ins.) was used as the counter electrode in all electrochemical
experiments. The LSV curves were obtained in the potential range of
0.2 to &#x02212;0.9 V<sub>RHE</sub> at a scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.</p><p>For pairing reactions, electrochemical testing was conducted
using an Autolab M204 (Metrohm) instrument within the cathode and
anode electrode configuration shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01135/suppl_file/au4c01135_si_001.pdf">Scheme S1</ext-link>. In these tests, the cathode electrode was PtRu alloy on
carbon fiber paper, placed in 0.1 M PBS electrolyte, while the anode
electrode was NiCo(OOH)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> nanosheets in
1 M KOH electrolyte. The CV was conducted at a scan rate of 10 mV
s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> within a potential range of &#x02212;1.5&#x02013;1.5
V. The combination of electrochemical reduction and oxidation reactions
was carried out in a 10 mM HMF solution. The coupled electrochemical
reduction and oxidation reactions were performed at a constant potential/current.
All experiments were carried out at 25 &#x000b0;C and 101.95 kPa. Further
