All studies in this area involve monitoring this intricate process, which is in the field time-consuming and challenging due to the considerable influence of environmental factors. This work explores the possibility of studying dormancy in grapevine by means of single-node cuttings of early- and late-bud break model cultivars Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon. Both visual phenotyping and differential thermal analysis confirmed the expected different pace of dormancy release in the two varieties. In addition, specific Gene Ontology (GO) categories with similar but shifted expression patterns between early-bud break Chardonnay and late-budbreak Cabernet Sauvignon have been identified, suggesting cultivar-specific regulation of shared molecular processes. Notably, the <italic>VviFT</italic> gene aligns with this timing shift, indicating its potential role in budbreak. We further confirm the importance of ABA inhibition in growth resumption and identify genes like <italic>VviSVP2</italic> and <italic>VviDRM1</italic> as possible dormancy release repressors. Our study enhances the understanding of the molecular network underpinning dormancy in grapevine buds and provides a robust framework for future research in this area.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00425-025-04677-2.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Phenotyping</kwd><kwd><italic>Vitis vinifera</italic></kwd><kwd>Spring</kwd><kwd>Budburst</kwd><kwd>Dormancy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>European Union - NextGeneration EU</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universit&#x000e0; degli Studi di Udine</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by Universit&#x000e0; degli Studi di Udine within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">The consequences of the changing climate (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2023</xref>) on grapevine cultivation are multiple and diverse, including abiotic stressors, ranging from drought to extreme heat exposure (van Leeuwen and Darriet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>). The challenge posed by temperature is dual. On one hand, its global increase accelerates plant development (Cameron et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2022</xref>), prompting early deacclimation and premature loss of cold hardiness in dormant buds. On the other hand, this makes buds susceptible to the risk of late frost damage in spring (De Rosa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2024</xref>). Despite the relevance of temperature variation on bud dormancy, the regulation of these responses remains poorly understood. Disentangling the molecular mechanisms involved in dormancy regulation is crucial to contrast the challenges posed by climate change and select, or breed, better-suited late-budbreak varieties (De Rosa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Given the significant impact of several environmental factors, such as temperature, soil and humidity (Signorelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2022</xref>), monitoring a trait such as budbreak in the field can be difficult, as conditions vary from one season to another. In addition, relying on field data necessitates accounting for several months until temperatures are favourable for deacclimation (Lang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1987</xref>). Moreover, budburst is considered reached when more than 50% of buds on the plant have opened (Pellegrino et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2022</xref>), implying multiple time-consuming observations for precise phenotyping. On these premises, avoiding the inherent variability found in the field to increase standardization is a desirable objective in phenotyping phenological progression.</p><p id="Par5">Single-node cuttings are routinely used in bud dormancy studies to test temperature and chemicals effects (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>; Rubio and P&#x000e9;rez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>), as well as in forcing studies for the generation of budbreak models and time-to-event studies (Fila et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>; Camargo Alvarez&#x000a0;et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>). Bud cuttings enable an increase in the number of replicates while requiring minimal space compared to whole plants. Single-node cuttings can also be easily subjected to controlled temperature and humidity conditions, improving the standardization and repeatability of environmental parameters in comparison to the field.</p><p id="Par6">A multitude of molecular studies has underlined the presence of a complex regulative mechanism associated with dormancy regulation and its release. Whereas several key processes have been proven to be involved in these events (Liu and Sherif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>; P&#x000e9;rez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2021</xref>), the knowledge around individual players remains limited (De Rosa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2021</xref>). Abscisic acid (ABA) metabolism is one of the most well characterized factors associated with dormancy regulation, with its synthesis playing a central role in the repression of bud meristem activity in grapevine (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>). Exogenous ABA application was found to enhance dormancy (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>). ABA synthesis is carried out by key enzymes known as <italic>NCEDs</italic> (<italic>9-cis Epoxycarotenoid Dioxygenase</italic>) (Sah et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2016</xref>). Zheng et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>) described the drop of <italic>VviNCED1</italic> transcript levels following the maximum depth of dormancy in grape buds, while <italic>VviNCED4</italic> expression was observed to specifically correlate with its trends (Shangguan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>). <italic>Dormancy-Associated MADS-box</italic> (DAMs) genes were also strongly connected to dormancy, as pointed out in revealing studies in <italic>Prunus persica ever-growing</italic> (non-dormant mutant) (Bielenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>). Distinct seasonal expression patterns were observed for individual <italic>DAMs</italic> in peach (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2009</xref>) and more recently in sweet cherry (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>) and apple (Falavigna et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2021</xref>), indicating both chilling requirement and photoperiod as important influencing factors. <italic>DAMs</italic> are closely phylogenetically related to <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> floral repressor <italic>Short Vegetative Phase</italic> (SVP) (Jim&#x000e9;nez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>), whose nomenclature is retained in non-<italic>Rosaceae</italic> plants such as <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>. A recent study explored the expression of <italic>VviDAM-SVPs</italic> in grapevine buds during para- and endodormancy, highlighting their differential patterns and associating their regulation to <italic>Flowering Locus T</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>) (Vergara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2021</xref>), a flowering time control gene found to be inversely expressed to <italic>SVP</italic> in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (Jeong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>VviFT</italic> has been associated with the activation of cell cycle genes in grapevine buds treated with dormancy-breaking compound hydrogen cyanamide (H<sub>2</sub>CN<sub>2</sub>) (Vergara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2016</xref>). This compound, in addition, indirectly determines the downregulation of <italic>DRM1</italic> (<italic>Dormancy Associated Protein 1</italic>), belonging to the DRM1/ARP family and first identified in pea (Stafstrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2000</xref>). <italic>DRM1</italic> expression is inversely correlated to budbreak occurrence in perennial species such as <italic>Actinidia deliciosa</italic> (Wood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2013</xref>) and <italic>Agave americana</italic> (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2023</xref>), and it is considered a strong dormancy marker.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, single-node cuttings of grapevine cultivars Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay, considered late- and early-budbreak varieties, respectively (Camargo-Alvarez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>), were subjected to forcing conditions to evaluate the consistency of their budburst timings in laboratory and field. Buds&#x02019; changes were monitored by visual observation and deacclimation progression was confirmed by differential thermal analysis (DTA). Additionally, an in-depth gene expression analysis was performed to further characterize the physiological and molecular differences between the two cultivars, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their distinct budbreak behaviours.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant material and phenological development observation</title><p id="Par8">One-year canes of late-budbreak cv.

A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to assess the quality of replicates and to monitor potential transcriptome changes throughout the experimental time course. PC1 (X-axis) and PC2 (Y-axis) explained 82% and 7% of the variance, respectively. The great variability captured by PC1 explained the segregation of 0 DOE samples of both varieties from all other time points. On the other hand, PC2 drove a clear separation between the 0 DOE samples of Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon, leaving all the other time points less resolved for both varieties (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). To better capture the transcriptomic changes taking place throughout forcing conditions, after 0 DOE, a second PCA was performed excluding this time point (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B<bold>)</bold>. The two components were thusly found to explain 61% and 13% of the variance, respectively, and distinct behaviors were observed for the two varieties. Namely, Cabernet Sauvignon samples from 3 to 4 DOE, found to group together, clustered separately from all Chardonnay samples along PC1. The late-budbreak cultivar 7 DOE samples appeared more sparse and closer to early Chardonnay samplings, suggesting a convergence of the transcriptomic landscape of the two cultivars at distinctly different timings. The early-budbreak cultivar 7 DOE samples were segregated separately from all the rest. Despite this different pacing, both varieties reached a similar transcriptome state at the end of the time course (10 DOE), distinguished from the others by PC2. On the other hand, PC1, which separated the samples based on their temporal progression, clearly showed that the samples 7 DOE of Chardonnay and 10 DOE of the two cultivars are nearly corresponding, marking the attainment of a near-stationary state in the early cultivar and its possible initiation in the late one.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of RNA-seq data of Chardonnay (CH) and Cabernet Sauvignon (CS) single-node cuttings throughout the experiment (<bold>A</bold>).

To gather insights into the prevailing gene expression dynamics among sequenced transcripts, a <italic>k</italic>-means clustering was performed based on transcript levels across the time course experiment. The clustering was applied to each cultivar separately to emphasize possible gene groups with distinct expression profiles or magnitude. Ten specific trends were detected in both Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon, grouped according to their pattern. Three major groups were detected for Chardonnay (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>): group 1, whose gene&#x02019;s expression does not change substantially throughout the experiment; group 2, including genes whose expression lowers in the transition from 0 to 3 DOE; group 3, containing genes which are increasingly upregulated from 0 to 7 DOE, and slightly downregulated at 10 DOE. Three clearly distinguishable groupings could also be identified for late-budbreak Cabernet Sauvignon (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), namely groups 1 and 2, not dissimilar to those described in Chardonnay, and group 3 clustering genes with gradually increasing expression from 0 to 10 DOE (Table S5). A prominent difference between cultivars could be ascribed to a non-symmetrical sorting of genes among the three gene groups.

For these reasons, the possibility to model dormancy progression and reduce the influence of environmental factors is desirable. The use of cuttings has proven to be a convenient and efficient way to carry out experiments on a smaller scale before applying findings to entire vineyards. It allows the comparison of different grape varieties or clones under standardized conditions, helping in identifying genetic factors that contribute to budbreak precocity and dormancy release (Fila et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>; Camargo Alvarez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>). Our results showed that the single-node cuttings model has been effective under forcing conditions and, notably, in an experiment where the temporal shift between two cultivars was crucial. In our experiment, the expected budbreak timing for the two genotypes was confirmed in cuttings subjected to standardized conditions: more than 50% of Chardonnay buds reached the BBCH 07&#x02013;09 stages at 10 DOE, with Cabernet Sauvignon achieving the same stages four days thereafter (data not shown). This is in alignment with natural budbreak timings observed in the field (Camargo Alvarez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>), while keeping in consideration that cuttings treated with stable chilling temperatures tend to reach budburst more rapidly than field-collected material (North and Kovaleski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2023</xref>). Visual phenotyping is supported by DTA data, which clearly depict the different evolutions of cold hardy states in the two genotypes in response to forcing conditions and confirm the slower reactivity of late-budbreak Cabernet Sauvignon, also observed in field conditions. Interestingly, Chardonnay LTEs, which correspond to freezing events of intracellular water within buds, routinely used as indicators of cold hardiness levels, remained unchanged throughout the time of observation. This may be due to a different sensitivity and perception of chilling temperatures between the two varieties. On the other hand, temperatures that are adequately low to maintain buds in a cold-hardy state in one cultivar, may contribute to chilling accumulation and induce deacclimation in another (North and Kovaleski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2023</xref>).</p><p id="Par37">The <italic>k</italic>-means clustering results further support the enhanced metabolic activity of Chardonnay cuttings, anticipated as compared to Cabernet Sauvignon. In fact, two of the clusters, identified as group 3 (G3) in both cultivars, included genes with an increasing expression trend over time which peaked earlier in Chardonnay at 7 DOE, compared to Cabernet Sauvignon, where it peaked at 10 DOE. This temporal shift could suggest an earlier response in Chardonnay compared to Cabernet Sauvignon, potentially reflecting cultivar-specific differences in transcriptional reprogramming and physiological responses. In fact, out of a total number of 1340 in Cabernet Sauvignon and 723 in Chardonnay (Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>), 667 genes were found to be shared between the two sets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Functional annotation further supports the observation of a consistent overlap in biological processes within these gene sets, predominantly involving protein synthesis and folding. These processes, critical for cellular function, have been shown to play key roles in various developmental stages, including budbreak and growth resumption (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par38">Moreover, a distinct distribution of genes across the three groups in the two cultivars was observed. In detail, several genes assigned to groups 2 and 3 in Cabernet Sauvignon, which exhibit variable expression patterns over the time course, belong to group 1 and maintain a steady expression level across all time points in Chardonnay. Thus, these genes could be actively modulated in the late budbreak cultivar in view of budbreak but no longer play a primary role in the early budbreak one.</p><p id="Par39">In addition to large-scale analysis, and to confirm its reliability, a targeted and more detailed study was conducted on genes identified in the literature as associated with dormancy progression. The expression pattern of the ABA-synthesis enzyme <italic>VviNCED6</italic> appeared consistent with the responses of the two cultivars to forcing conditions. Indeed, the gene was more highly expressed at the first sampling in Cabernet Sauvignon, as shown by qPCR data and strengthened by normalized RNA-seq counts. On the other hand, the role in the natural dormancy release of <italic>VviNCED6</italic> was previously supported by Zheng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>), who referred to it as <italic>VviNCED1</italic>. Since ABA production is strongly associated with a dormant state in buds (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>), this evidence supports an anticipated dormancy release in Chardonnay. This result is further confirmed by the expression trends of two other <italic>NCEDs</italic>, <italic>VviNCED4</italic> and <italic>VviNCED5</italic>, and concurs with previously collected evidence showing a decrease of <italic>VviNCED4</italic> expression in buds collected from January to March in field conditions in the northern hemisphere (Shangguan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>VviNCED4</italic> gene counts consistently maintain a low level in early-budbreak Chardonnay throughout the experiment, suggesting that its peak expression may have occurred prior to the initial sampling. Dormancy-regulated MADS-box gene <italic>VviSVP2</italic> is also most expressed at 0 DOE in both cultivars; however, its decreasing trend appears sharper in Chardonnay and more gradual in Cabernet Sauvignon. Previous evidence has described a reduction of <italic>VviSVP2</italic> expression in the transition from paradormancy to endodormancy in grapevine buds, but no clear trend was detected during ecodormancy release in forcing conditions (Vergara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2021</xref>). Nevertheless, kiwifruit <italic>SVP2</italic> overexpression was found to delay budbreak in <italic>A. deliciosa</italic> and, in association with a proposed ABA-mimicking effect from a transcriptomic point of view, lead to connecting <italic>AdSVP2</italic> to deep bud dormancy maintenance (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2017</xref>). In light of these considerations, the <italic>VviSVP2</italic> patterns observed in this study support an anticipated release from dormancy in Chardonnay, in accordance with what observed for <italic>VviNCED6</italic> and <italic>VviNCED4</italic>. Moreover, it is rather reasonable that the cessation of ABA hormone synthesis precedes the induction of budbreak, in which VviSVP could play a pivotal role.</p><p id="Par40">The contrasting relation between <italic>SVP</italic> and the flowering time regulator <italic>FT</italic> has been mostly characterized in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (Jeong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007</xref>). However, recently collected data have suggested a similar relationship between <italic>VviFT</italic> and <italic>VvDAM3-SVP</italic> in grapevine, across several experimental conditions (Vergara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2021</xref>). Moreover, <italic>VviFT</italic> was found to be downregulated in grapevine buds and leaves exposed to short photoperiod (Vergara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2016</xref>), and in buds during endodormancy (D&#x000ed;az-Riquelme et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>; Vergara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2016</xref>). Additionally, H<sub>2</sub>CN<sub>2</sub> prompted <italic>VviFT</italic> expression in grapevine buds (Vergara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2016</xref>) similarly to natural budbreak and hypoxia (Vergara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2012</xref>). In this study, differential <italic>VviFT</italic> expression patterns were observed in late-budbreak cultivar Cabernet Sauvignon and early-budbreak Chardonnay. <italic>VviFT</italic> expression in Chardonnay sharply increases during forcing conditions to reach a peak at 7 DOE, corresponding to more than 50% of buds having reached the stages of initial green growth, following which its expression decreases. In these phases of phenological development, grapevine buds show clearly visible morphological changes and are completely deacclimated. Although less noticeable, a slight increase of expression is also present in Cabernet Sauvignon at 10 DOE, allowing us to speculate that Cabernet Sauvignon might show a similar peak at a later stage. These findings hint at the involvement of <italic>VviFT</italic> in the preparatory stages of budbreak, kickstarting the overall process in concomitance with the perception of growth-promoting temperatures and culminating during wool emergence. The observed decrease of expression at more advanced BBCH stages suggests that the control of subsequent bud and shoot development may be handed over to other, currently unknown, molecular drivers. The less clear trend observed in Cabernet Sauvignon could be explained by the slower reactivity demonstrated by LTEs, as well as previously described gene expression evidence.</p><p id="Par41">Finally, to our knowledge, this study presents the first example of a putative homolog of <italic>DRM1</italic> identified in grapevine. <italic>AdDRM1</italic> was found to exhibit a strong inverse correlation with growth onset in kiwifruit and to be downregulated by dormancy-breaking compound H<sub>2</sub>CN<sub>2</sub> (Wood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2013</xref>). In addition, a connection to ABA and auxin signaling was hypothesized by Stafstrom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2000</xref>), following the detection of a relevant reduction of <italic>PsDRM1/2</italic> expression in pea axillary buds after terminal bud removal, and induction by ABA treatment. Similarly, the expression of <italic>DRM/ARP</italic> gene <italic>RpARP1</italic> was downregulated by exogenous auxin application in <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> and was negatively correlated to hypocotyl growth (Park and Han <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2003</xref>). At present, however, the connection between these hormones and <italic>DRMs</italic> regulation appears controversial and up for debate (Rae et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>). All evidence considered, the expression of putative <italic>VvDRM1</italic> is consistent with its expected role as a dormancy marker. Similarly to what happens for <italic>VviSVP</italic>, it could be speculated that <italic>VviDRM1</italic> also shows high initial levels followed by downregulation, with a swifter decline in Chardonnay and a more gradual decrease in Cabernet. In this perspective, <italic>VviDRM1</italic>, like <italic>VviSVP</italic>, would also act downstream ABA signal, in allowing dormancy release and the resumption of growth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">The use of single-node cuttings proved to be an effective method for the screening of budbreak timing in grapevine. This method provides a controlled environment for comparison among different grape genotypes and the possibility to quickly phenotype the spring phenology under controlled conditions. This approach allowed us, on the one hand, to exclude the effect of environmental variables and, on the other hand, to distinguish between general regulatory mechanisms that control budbreak and those specific to particular cultivars. One of the key findings of this study is the identification of specific Gene Ontology (GO) categories displaying similar, yet temporally shifted expression patterns between the two cultivars. This suggests that, while the same biological processes may be involved in budbreak across cultivars, their regulation differs, potentially reflecting cultivar-specific timing in dormancy release. Among the genes identified in the literature as crucial for dormancy progression, <italic>VviFT</italic> appears to be the only one exhibiting an expression pattern consistent with the aforementioned shift. In detail, our results confirm the primary role of ABA biosynthesis inhibition for the resumption of growth and budbreak. Other molecular drivers, such as <italic>VviSVP2</italic>, <italic>VviFT</italic> and <italic>VviDRM1</italic>, which, as far as we know, have been little or never studied in grapevine buds, could act downstream. In particular, while <italic>VviSVP2</italic> and <italic>VviDRM1</italic> could be considered &#x0201c;repressors&#x0201d;, as their downregulation is needed for phenological progression, <italic>VviFT</italic> could have a triggering role in the process leading to budbreak.</p><p id="Par43">Moreover, our findings revealed that the activation of <italic>VviFT</italic> is not solely dependent on the downregulation of <italic>VviSVP</italic> (similar in both Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon), indicating that other cultivar-specific factors play a role in <italic>VviFT</italic> activation. The focus of this study does not extend to establishing a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the expression of genes such as <italic>VviFT</italic> and the broader metabolic shifts described by Group 3 (G3); the complexity of these interactions requires more detailed investigation to distinguish between regulatory effects and downstream responses (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). However, our results enhance the understanding of the intricate regulatory network controlling dormancy in grapevine buds and provide a reliable method for further investigations in this field.<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;11</label><caption><p>Hypothesis on gene regulatory mechanisms underlying differential budbreak timing. The decrease in ABA and the downregulation of <italic>VviNCED6</italic> are necessary but not sufficient conditions to initiate budburst; in Chardonnay this process appears to be at a significantly more advanced stage. The genes <italic>VviSVP</italic> and <italic>VviDRM1</italic>, possibly controlled by ABA, also show different expression dynamics in the two cultivars, with Chardonnay displaying a more sudden downregulation. This, along with other factors, likely contributes to the activation of <italic>VviFT</italic>, which in Chardonnay peaks in synchrony with budbreak. The concurrent activation of several gene categories (Group 3 in the schematic graph) may be involved in the process. Blue color gradients are purely illustrative and represent the gene expression patterns, measured by qRT-PCR throughout the experiment (from 0 to 10 DOE). For simplicity, the same representation has been used for <italic>VviSVP</italic> and <italic>VviDRM1</italic>. <italic>Ch</italic>&#x02009;Chardonnay, <italic>CS</italic>&#x02009;Cabernet Sauvignon</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="425_2025_4677_Fig11_HTML" id="MO11"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="425_2025_4677_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 560 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="425_2025_4677_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx"><caption><p>Supplementary file2 (XLSX 40061 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM3"><media xlink:href="425_2025_4677_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx"><caption><p>Supplementary file3 (XLSX 189 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Vivai Cooperativi Rauscedo (VCR, Italy) for kindly providing the plant material used in this study.
