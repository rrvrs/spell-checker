On a societal level, it represents a considerable obstacle to economic growth and advancement by lowering human and social capital. Since many children worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries, experience violence by teachers at school, there is an urgent need for efficacious and scalable interventions to prevent violence by teachers and improve teacher-student interactions. To this end, the present study examines the effectiveness of the intervention Interaction Competencies with Children &#x02013; for Teachers (ICC-T) to reduce physical and emotional violence by teachers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study adopts a cluster-randomized controlled trial design with schools (clusters) as level of randomization and three data assessment points: baseline assessment prior to the intervention, the first follow-up assessment 6&#x000a0;months after the intervention and the second follow-up assessment 18&#x000a0;months after the intervention. Across four different sites in Pakistan, a total number of 48 public single-gender high schools (24 girls&#x02019; and 24 boys&#x02019; schools) are randomly selected. After baseline assessment, half of the schools are randomly allocated to the intervention group, in which teachers at selected schools receive ICC-T, and the other half to the control group, in which teachers receive no intervention. At each school, 30 students in the sixth year of school and all teachers (expected average number: 15) are recruited. Thus, the final sample comprises at least 1300 students and 720 teachers. Data are collected through structured interviews, standardized cognitive tests and school records. Primary outcome measures are student- and teacher-reported physical and emotional violence by teachers in the past week. Secondary outcome measures include teachers&#x02019; attitudes towards violence and children&#x02019;s mental health problems, quality of life and cognitive functioning. Other outcomes are students&#x02019; academic performance and peer violence. Data will be analyzed using multilevel analyses. </p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study aims to provide initial evidence of the effects of ICC-T on children&#x02019;s exposure to violence at schools, their well-being and functioning in the context of Pakistan.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">The clinical trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024) under the identifier NCT06001554 (Preventing Physical and Emotional Violence by Teachers in Public Schools in Pakistan (ICC-T_Pak), 2023) on August 21<sup>st</sup>, 2023.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>Cluster-randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Public schools</kwd><kwd>School violence</kwd><kwd>Teacher violence</kwd><kwd>Mental health</kwd><kwd>Functioning</kwd><kwd>Pakistan</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universit&#x000e4;t Bielefeld (3146)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">Despite global efforts to outlaw violence against children, more than 1.7 billion children &#x02013; 75% of all children worldwide &#x02013; experience violence in their upbringing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Strikingly, violence against children in various forms &#x02013; physical, emotional, sexual or neglect&#x02014;is most often perpetrated by adults in children&#x02019;s close social circles, such as parents, caregivers, teachers and other authority figures, who should nurture and protect them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The most common form of such violence is corporal punishment, defined as &#x0201c;any punishment in which physical force is used and intended to cause some degree of pain or discomfort, however light&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite being more challenging to conceptualize and operationalize, emotional abuse, which may include spurning, rejecting or denying emotional responsiveness to a child, is a very common form of violence against children as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization, violence against children at the hands of teachers continues to be a serious issue, as 732 million minors aged 6&#x02013;17 years are estimated to live in countries where corporal punishment in schools is not fully prohibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The potential negative impacts of childhood violence in schools are manifold and have been documented by numerous studies and reviews, including impairments of brain development, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning, and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A review by Gershoff et al. observed consistent links between physical punishment and detrimental outcomes for children across cultural, family and neighborhood contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In line with this, Cuartas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] recently showed that children who were spanked exhibited greater activation in multiple regions of the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, suggesting that the experience may alter neural responses to environmental threats in a manner similar to more severe forms of violence.</p><p id="Par7">The majority of studies examining the nature and impact of violence against children comes from higher income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] although approximately 90% of the children and adolescents in the world live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. While some evidence suggests that the effects of physical discipline on children&#x02019;s adjustment may be moderated by the perceived normativeness of the practice in the specific cultural context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], studies from different LMICs like Colombia, Ghana and South Africa indicate that children usually experience fear and distress in reaction to violence and process violent experiences as threatening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Research shows there are no positive effects of physical punishment whatsoever on improving child behavior or other outcomes for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. On the contrary, evidence suggests that children exposed to corporal punishment, irrespective of the socio-cultural context, are about 24% less likely to be developmentally on track than children who are not exposed to violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Like in many other LMICs, violence against children is widespread in Pakistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Corporal punishment of children in home and school settings has become part of a social norm as reflected in a number of survey reports. According to Plan Pakistan and Plan International, majorities of teachers and parents agree that teachers are justified in beating students who are rude or disobedient and that physical punishment is necessary for most children to ensure academic achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In line with such attitudes are reports that physical punishment was used in 89% of schools in Punjab, with the practice being most common in public schools, followed by private schools, and then schools for religious education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Similarly, in a large study across 40 public schools in Sindh province, Khuwaja et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] reported that overall 91.4% of boys and 60.9% of girls reported having experienced corporal punishment at school in the previous four weeks, even though the local government had banned corporal punishment in schools in 2011.</p><p id="Par9">With more than 40% of the country&#x02019;s population under the age of 15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], violence by teachers and its detrimental outcomes pose a significant threat to Pakistan&#x02019;s social capital. Ahmad et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] identified corporal punishment as the main reason for children leaving school at primary level in Pakistan. Given the strong association between exposure to violence and subsequent drug and alcohol use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], violence at school is likely to contribute to the alarming levels of drug abuse observed in Pakistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. As children who are victims of violence are commonly perpetrators of violence against family and community members in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], childhood violence exposure is also likely to be a strong contributory factor to Pakistan&#x02019;s extremely high prevalence rates of gender-based violence, with 70&#x02014;90% of married women reporting abuse from their spouses at any time in their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">One way of enabling social change is through the law, e.g., legally protecting children from abuse with the expectation that legal reform will not only limit the use of these harmful practices but will also change attitudes and thus prevent violence. Socio-legal research from Sweden shows that legal bans on corporal punishment are closely associated with decreases in support and use of corporal punishment and can contribute to a societal change towards a violence free upbringing of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In Pakistan, corporal punishment of children by teachers and caregivers in institutional settings and workplaces has been legally banned in the federal capital of Islamabad in 2021, but it is still not fully banned in the whole country and not in all settings, including families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">While important, legal prohibition alone seems not sufficient to reduce violence against children, as indicated by findings of continuously high prevalence rates of corporal punishment at school in some regions despite existing legal bans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Legal reforms need to be accompanied by programs that address deeply ingrained attitudes and social norms that endorse the use of violence as a necessary practice to raise and educate children. Research suggests that social norms shape beliefs and attitudes towards violent parenting, which in turn guide behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, this opens the opportunity of preventing violence against children by shifting attitudes and social norms that sustain it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, to transform a classroom culture that they themselves grew up with, teachers should be equipped with non-violent interactional skills and competencies as alternatives to violence.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Evidence-based intervention programs to prevent violence by teachers</title><p id="Par12">To date, there are only few evaluated interventions that have shown to be feasible and efficacious at reducing teachers&#x02019; use of violence against children in primary or secondary schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. One of them, the Good School Toolkit, an intervention that aims to shift school operational culture through individual behavior-change techniques, has been implemented and tested in primary schools in Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The IRIE Classroom Toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], another training program for teachers to support managing child behaviors and foster their social-emotional competence, has been implemented and tested in pre-schools and primary schools in Jamaica. More details on these programs have been discussed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The third intervention program in that line is Interaction Competencies with Children &#x02013; for Teachers (ICC-T), which aims to reduce violence by teachers and improve student&#x02013;teacher interactions using a week-long workshop format involving teachers. A unique aspect of ICC-T is that it explicitly addresses and seeks to change social norms and attitudes that perpetuate violent practices by encouraging teachers to question them in the light of their own personal experiences of violence. This creates the basis for teachers to be willing to learn, practice and apply alternative non-violent strategies (see more details below in the Methods section). ICC-T has&#x000a0;been shown to successfully reduce physical and emotional violence by teachers in cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs) in primary and secondary schools in Tanzania and Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In a trial in primary schools in Tanzania, the intervention also led to reduced rates of violence among peers. Currently, ICC-T is being evaluated further in ongoing cRCTs in Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda and Haiti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">The present study will implement and evaluate ICC-T in a cRCT in Pakistan, for the first time in Asia and in a predominantly Islamic country. Given the differences between this context and previous implementations of ICC-T, and in line with recommendations for complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], we first conducted a feasibility study with two schools in each of the planned four sites in Pakistan. The results of this unpublished study showed a high demand, acceptance and motivation regarding the intervention among participating teachers. Further, ICC-T could be feasibly implemented with few contextual adaptations and the uncontrolled design provided preliminary evidence that ICC-T can effectively reduce teachers&#x02019; use of and positive attitudes towards violent discipline in Pakistan. Based on these promising findings and the demonstrated feasibility and efficacy of ICC-T in other contexts, we proceed with testing the effectiveness of ICC-T in Pakistan in a definite cRCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. So far, there have been no scientific effectiveness evaluations of interventions aiming to reduce teachers&#x02019; use of violence against children in the context of Pakistan, which underscores the need for this study. The only cRCT of a school violence program conducted in Pakistan, the Right to Play&#x02019;s school-based intervention aiming to reduce peer violence in public schools, also found a reduction in student-reported corporal punishment by teachers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, this intervention did not explicitly target violence by teachers by reducing teachers&#x02019; positive attitudes towards violence and equipping them with non-violent alternative teaching strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives and hypotheses</title><p id="Par15">Following a similar approach as previous and ongoing cRCTs of ICC-T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], the present study aims to examine the effects of ICC-T on <italic>a)</italic> teachers&#x02019; use of physical and emotional violence against students, and <italic>b)</italic> on students&#x02019; functioning (mental health, well-being, and cognitive functioning) in secondary schools in different regions in Pakistan.

Given ICC-T&#x02019;s focus on changing teachers&#x02019; attitudes and the known negative effects of violence on children&#x02019;s functioning, we also hypothesize that the intervention will reduce teachers&#x02019; positive attitudes towards violent discipline and improve students&#x02019; functioning as indicated by lower levels of mental health problems and higher levels of quality of life, and cognitive functioning (<italic>secondary outcomes</italic>).

The study involves three data collection phases: baseline assessment directly before the intervention (t0), and two follow-up assessments approximately 6&#x000a0;months (t1) and 18 months (t2) after the intervention.

These sites were chosen to consider different parts of the country that cover a broad range of geographical, cultural and socio-economic aspects. Within each site, three districts are purposefully selected to represent urban and rural areas. Within Islamabad Capital Territory and the province of Punjab, the three districts are the rural zone of Islamabad and the two Punjabi districts Rawalpindi and Attock. In Sindh, the three districts are Khairpur, Suukur and Naushoru Feroze. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the three districts have been identified but remain to be finally confirmed due to a delayed start of the study activities. In Azad Jammu and Kashmir, the three selected districts are Bagh, Haveli Kahota and Poonch (Rawalkot). When this study protocol was submitted, baseline assessments and ICC-T workshops had already been started in all three districts in Sindh and in two districts in the combined site Islamabad/Punjab.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Schools</title><p id="Par19">In each of the selected districts, schools meeting the following criteria are eligible for inclusion into the study. (1) Public, single-gender secondary/junior high schools. With public schooling being the primary model of education and physical punishment most common in public schools, our study is carried out in public secondary/junior high schools. Single-gender schools are selected because majority of the public schools in Pakistan, especially in the rural areas, are single-gender and the teachers are hired accordingly. (2) At least 30 students in the selected class. In case a selected class has fewer than 30 students, it is combined with a neighboring public single-gender school (within 15 km) to a school cluster and 15 students from each school are selected. (3) At least 15 and no more than 50 teachers at a school. In case of fewer than 15 teachers, a school cluster with a neighboring school (within 15 km) is formed and all teachers officially working at these schools are included. The upper limit of 50 teachers is due to practical difficulties related to providing the intervention to a high number of potential participants.

One school of the pair of single-gender schools in a district is randomly allocated to the intervention group, while the other school is allocated to the control group.

In addition to prior experience in research projects on social and health-related topics, the assessors are required to hold a university bachelor&#x02019;s degree, be fluent in Urdu, which is the national language and the main mode of teaching across the country, as well as in the local language, and have basic level fluency in English. The assessors are blind to the allocation of the schools to the intervention and control groups. The assessment of students consists of a structured interview and a cognitive test, which take about one and a half hours in total. The assessment of teachers consists of a structured interview and takes about one hour. In the interview, assessors directly enter participants&#x02019; responses into Android tablets using the survey software SurveyToGo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The cognitive testing is also administered to the students on the tablets using Inquisit Web [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].

Students whose parents have signed the informed consent form are invited to an interview in a quiet and discreet&#x000a0;setting in the school premises. Before the interview, each student is given detailed written and oral information on the study procedure, the confidentiality of their data, and their right to withdraw from the study at any time without any consequences, and they are asked to provide their written consent to participation. Similarly, after being introduced to the study in a formal information session, all teachers at each selected school are invited to participate in an interview, and willing teachers receive detailed written and oral information on the study procedure, the confidentiality of their data, and their right to withdraw from the study at any time without any consequences, and provide written informed consent. The assessment procedures are repeated in the same way at 6-months and 18-months follow-ups. Students can be considered masked throughout the study as the intervention only targets teachers. Given the nature of the intervention, teachers are masked at baseline assessment but unmasked at the follow-up assessments.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intervention description</title><p id="Par25">The ICC-T intervention consists of a 5-day training workshop for teachers that is delivered by local facilitators and focuses on providing teachers with practical information and tools to prevent the use of violent disciplinary strategies in class and improve their interaction competencies with children. Sessions are divided into 5 modules: 1) Sessions about teacher-student interactions aim to promote teachers&#x02019; empathy and understanding of their students&#x02019; behavior and to raise teachers&#x02019; awareness of being a role model for students. 2) Sessions on maltreatment prevention aim to raise teachers&#x02019; awareness of the negative consequences of violent discipline on children&#x02019;s well-being by inviting teachers to reflect on their own experiences of violence as a child and connect these experiences and associated feelings to the causes and consequences of their current violent behavior. 3) Sessions on effective discipline strategies aim to equip teachers with non-violent behavioral skills and tools helping them to maintain and reinforce desired behaviors and to change undesirable behavior by students. 4) Sessions on identifying and supporting burdened students intend to raise teachers&#x02019; awareness for common internalizing and externalizing problems among students and to increase their ability to identify and adequately support students with these problems. 5) Lastly, sessions on implementation aim at integrating the learned knowledge and skills into everyday school life and at ensuring sustainability to establishing support networks such as peer consultation and collaboration with school counselors (where available) and parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">With behavior change as the primary objective, the content of ICC-T as an intervention was developed based on attachment theory, behavior modification theory, and social learning theory, and the central aspects of non-violent interaction between teachers and students being based on the work of the Democratic Classroom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]<sup>.</sup> For the implementation of the content, established methods that have been shown to lead to a change in behavior, such as inputs, role plays, discussion, and reflections, are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The structure of the training is important as it allows for a dynamic wherein a willingness to change is initially achieved, which is then followed by practical alternative strategies.

Participation in the training workshop is free of charge. All teachers at a selected school receive detailed written information on the training procedure, the voluntary nature of their participation as well as their right to withdraw from the training at any point. Teachers who agree to participate in the training need to sign an&#x000a0;additional informed consent form. In order to ensure that lessons can continue, half of the teachers in a school receive the intervention in one week and the other half of the teachers in the following week. Confidentiality of participants&#x02019; personal data and information shared during the training is ensured at any time. Treatment fidelity is assessed through questionnaires answered by the facilitators and randomly selected participants on each day of the workshop and through video recordings of pre-determined sequences of selected sessions. Questionnaires for facilitators cover information on each session&#x02019;s duration, applied methods, deviations from the intervention manual and didactical aspects, as well as perceived uptake of the session content by participants. Questionnaires for participants focus on their perceived understanding of the day&#x02019;s training content and the helpfulness of the applied methods in delivering the content. In addition, all participants evaluate the training contents and methods using a questionnaire at the end of the workshop. Video recordings are evaluated by independent raters to determine whether intervention workshops have been implemented in line with the manual. Contamination is assessed by interviewing the head teacher and five randomly selected teachers at each school around each follow-up timepoint about whether they shared materials or content from the ICC-T intervention with teachers in other schools.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Control condition</title><p id="Par28">No intervention is implemented in control schools.

Comprehensive training of data collectors and the structured interview format aim at reducing participants&#x02019; reporting biases and at increasing the validity of responses. Allocation to intervention and control group at the cluster level performed by independent personnel following baseline assessment ensures that those collecting data are blind to the treatment conditions of the schools. While teachers&#x02019; reports of violence against students are a direct measure of behavioural change that considers the variety of daily interactions that teachers have with students, their reports could be influenced towards lower levels of violence by participation in the intervention.

This also refers to video recordings of teachers participating in the intervention. Personal data are not disclosed to any other person without the participant&#x02019;s permission or as required by the law. As behavioral intervention studies are minimum risk studies, no adverse events are expected as consequences of the intervention itself.

Second, participants may present with severe mental health concerns, such as suicidal ideation or behaviour. Third, participants may experience severe ongoing abuse. In all cases, participants will receive immediate psychological support by a trained psychologist who is part of the research team.

Evidence from economics shows that education and health have a significant impact on socio-economic outcomes. An additional year of education raises an individual&#x02019;s monthly income in Pakistan by about 7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Children who experience violence in school are more likely to drop out of school and are therefore more likely to live a life in poverty. This is critical for a young country like Pakistan where 0&#x02013;14 years old children and adolescents make up 35% of the country&#x02019;s population. Pakistan is at a critical juncture where lawmakers have finally realized that prevention of violence against children by teachers is not only necessary for the well-being of its youth but also for fostering socio-economic development in the long run. However, achieving this just through legal prohibition may not be enough. Teachers and other staff in institutional care settings need support and alternative behavioral strategies and tools.</p><p id="Par42">Following the idea of a &#x0201c;bottom-up&#x0201d; approach towards the prevention of violence targeting schools as engines for societal change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] this study&#x02019;s implementation of ICC-T in Pakistan will expand the scientific evaluation of school-based interventions to reduce violence. ICC-T has been implemented successfully in Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania, and Haiti. The program is based on social learning and attachment theories and uses established methods for implementation of the content and achieving the goal of behavior change. Methods aiming to increase teachers&#x02019; empathy and change their attitudes are used as well as practicing of specific strategies to handle situations in the classroom non-violently.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par43">Attitudes toward the use of violence are rooted in and intertwined with cultural and societal factors. The historic development and embedding of such attitudes and beliefs contribute to the fact that they cannot easily be eradicated. Hence, the expected changes in attitudes and behavior must be considered as preliminary only, as profound changes might take time. The duration of follow-up in this study might lead to underestimation of intervention effects, as the outcome measures will only capture changes within about 1.5 years. Some diffusion of intervention activities between control and intervention schools cannot be ruled out completely. Due to the random selection, it is possible that two schools allocated to control group and intervention group, respectively, are somehow close to each other, which might contribute to underestimation of intervention effects as well. We aim to assess potential diffusion of intervention contents by asking school principals and teachers about it. Furthermore, the longitudinal design of the study might provide challenges related to the retention of the sample. Several unforeseeable factors among participating children and teachers such as moving to another location, changing schools, dropping out of school or absenteeism might affect the findings of the study. Similarly, teachers&#x02019; schedules might interfere with training schedules, hence, flexibility in timing and providing the training workshops might be necessary. For a successful implementation of the study, it is further crucial to include relevant stakeholders of education and school administration on political and practical levels. However, participation is voluntary in our study, so we must consider the risk that a small number of schools willing to participate might affect the generalizability of the study results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par44">This study is the first trial of a school-based approach aiming to explicitly prevent violence by teachers in Pakistan. It aims to provide further information on the effectiveness of ICC-T, an interactive intervention designed for teachers to&#x000a0;change their attitudes towards violence and to learn how to use non-violent discipline measures in school settings in a practical way. The evidence from the proposed cRCT will enable us to link violence reduction to education, health, and societal outcomes and thus provide valuable gateway for communities, the education system, governments and policy-makers to guide actions and investments in promoting the safety of school-going children and adolescents in Pakistan.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Alaptagin Khan, Katharina Goessmann and Florian Scharpf contributed equally to this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AKH, KG, FS, AKI, FKSS and TH designed the study.
