Current leadless pacemakers include battery-operated devices that are relatively large in size. We present here the initial design and animal experiments with a new ultrathin leadless device, activated by subcutaneous application of short trains of high frequency (250&#x000a0;kHz) alternating electrical fields (HFAF). The myocardial 40&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.5&#x000a0;mm rectifying device, implanted in the right ventricle and in epicardial veins, converts the HFAF sinusoidal transients to unidirectional current pulses which stimulate the myocardium. The method was tested in a swine model under open and closed chest conditions for both endocardial and cardiac venous approaches. We demonstrated pacing under all these conditions and measured the thresholds of current, voltage and pulse duration. This method allows for leadless stimulation at multiple points. It may be applied to various pacing needs and has an interesting appeal for CRT Therapy, where multiple electrodes can be implanted, overcoming the limitations of current long pacing leads.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Physiology</kwd><kwd>Cardiology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>CardoAid</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Cardiac pacemakers, including cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) involve long leads originating at the implanted stimulator, traversing valves and vascular structures to reach the target cardiac stimulation site. Current lead-dependent technologies are associated with an estimated 15% three-year complication rate, including lead dislodgement and failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, pocket hematoma and infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, all of which contribute to morbidity, mortality, and significant healthcare costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Recently, leadless technology that includes the implantation of an entire pacemaker with its battery and electronics at the stimulation site was introduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Yet, current iterations of leadless pacemakers are limited to one site, and lack the versatility offered by transvenous devices. Leadless stimulation to the LV endocardium as part of CRT therapy using ultrasound energy and an LV endocardial receiver and stimulator is currently under evaluation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The disadvantages of the current leadless devices include size that prevents implantation through the coronary sinus and cardiac venous system, battery depletion and a high risk procedure when extraction is required<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">The current paper describes a new method (developed by CardoAid&#x02122;) for leadless cardiac stimulation using an ultra-thin wire-like device that can be applied to the right ventricle endocardium for direct myocardial stimulation as well as transvenous epicardial stimulation through the coronary sinus. The stimulation current source is a high frequency alternating electric field (HFAF) transients generated in the torso by external or subcutaneous electrodes. Using an implanted ultrathin rectifying device, the captured high frequency current is rectified and stimulates the myocardium at the point of contact. This method can be applied to the needs of multisite cardiac stimulation protocols for CRT as well as other stimulation needs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method of stimulation</title><p id="Par8">The present method is based on the leadless stimulation method first described by Palti in 1962<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. At the basis of this methodology is the elimination of the conducting leads that deliver the stimulating current pulses (0.5&#x02013;10ms) from the source (usually an external waveform generator) to the stimulating electrodes. Instead, the currents are derived from the high frequency alternating electric fields HFAF generated in the body volume by external or subcutaneous electrodes. Such alternating fields or currents do not stimulate excitable tissues. The reason for the lack of stimulating power is the rapid change in current polarity from one that stimulates to one that inhibits excitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The kinetics of the electric excitability parameters of the cells are too slow to follow the rapidly alternating field changes. The safety and lack of any stimulating effect of such fields when applied to the human torso have been demonstrated by Blatt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Electrodes of the rectifying device [RD] positioned at the stimulation site, pick up the fields, rectify the currents they generate and deliver rectified high frequency alternating currents to the selected site. The rectified current pulses have the capability to stimulate and thus pace, provided their distribution is such that they exceed threshold at the site.

</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>The implanted rectifying device</title><p id="Par16">The implanted RDs consist of a rectifier and a pair of leads. Rectifiers are solid state elements that can be less than 100 microns in size. The rectifiers are connected to a pair of conductors, that are insulated except for their proximal and distal segments. The cathode tip is in the shape of a helical screw (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>-A) or a dome-like head (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>-B), that are in direct contact with the myocardium. The RD studied was 40&#x000a0;mm in length and 0.5&#x000a0;mm in diameter. The symmetric alternating polarity current pulses that flow in the torso (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) become unipolar (half-rectified) in presence of the device and can thus stimulate the tissue and pace the heart. Threshold stimulating current amplitude ranges were 0.5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mA, same as for the conventional pulses used in pacing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We used pacing pulse durations between 0.5-10ms at a pacing rate ranging between 100 and 120 pulse per minute. Note that the half-rectified current pulses (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) thus formed have about 50% stimulating power compared with a square pulse. To generate such a current the potential differences between the rectifier contact points are in the order of 1&#x02013;10 volts.</p><p id="Par17">

The complications include risk of endovascular infection that is in strict relation to the number of leads implanted and to their length across the vascular system, lead failure that includes insulation breach and lead fracture, sensing and threshold problems and vascular complications like fibrosis and vein occlusion in different sites along the lead course.</p><p id="Par51">The advantage of the present pacing method is the ability to pace from different sites, such as the right ventricle endocardium and the left ventricle epicardium, either by a pericardial approach or through the coronary veins. The system is capable of simultaneous pacing from different venous sites through the coronary sinus. Additionally, the rectifying devices can be implanted in various locations in the heart and can be used for direct left bundle branch pacing and lead to physiological conduction system pacing. Obviously, the small myocardial rectifying devices, by not traversing the venous system, reduce the risk of lead infection. In case of need for extraction, these 4&#x000a0;cm long devices may be caught by available snare devices and retracted. However, we have not conducted yet long term studies that will address these and other issues. Note that it is very likely that results similar to the above can be obtained using 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;cm long rectifying devices and higher amplitude fields.</p><p id="Par52">The safety of using high frequency alternating fields across the chest has been demonstrated by the Novocure therapy for lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In that case the electrical fields were applied to the chest for long periods (week to months) and were shown to be free of any stimulatory or adverse events in the body. In the current method the high frequency field is applied in short pulses at the required pacing rate, and therefore the electrical field used is limited by the duration of the stimulation. When compared to other leadless pacemakers (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), it is clear that the current RD is of a much smaller diameter than that used today. This advantage is of appealing application to CRT, where multiple electrodes may be implanted. It can also be used in LV endocardial approach, as was used by Jashan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The ability to simultaneously activate several LV wall electrodes is also of interest and requires further studies. Another potential application that has not been tested is pacing of the left bundle for better synchronization.</p><p id="Par53">

</p><p id="Par54">Biphasic stimulating currents may have an advantage in electrode contact preservation during long-term activity and in providing better performance, based on a study by Mower et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. While we can produce only monophasic pulses using rectified HFAF, we have clearly shown the feasibility of using this as a pacing method. It is to be emphasized that except for the paper cited above, there is very little data comparing monophasic with biphasic waveforms, and most pacemakers do not publish their pacing pulses (Mono- or biphasic forms) in their research articles. Further studies will have to validate the long-term efficiency of our pacing method as compared to current methods.</p><p id="Par55">Obviously, in this publication we were limited to acute experiments. The limitations of the method that need to be addressed in the future include the long-term durability of the stimulation method. As we know from the classical pacing methods, the threshold for stimulation may increase in time due to fibrosis and may require adjustment of the voltage and duration of the stimulation pulse. In our case this will have to be studied in chronic models and in patients.</p><p id="Par56">In summary, we have shown the feasibility of a novel pacing method using high frequency external fields for stimulation by implanted rectifying devices in direct contact with the myocardium. This may have direct application to CRT for heart failure patients and other pacing indications.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><sec id="d33e720"><title>Disclosure</title><p>R.B. and Y.P. are founders and stock holders R.S. and A.D. are option holders.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>R.B. and Y.P. and W.D. and R.S. wrote the main manuscript text;&#x000a0;R.B. and W.D. and R.S. and A.D. performed preclinical studies;&#x000a0;All authors reviewed the manuscript.</p></notes><notes notes-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The datasets recorded and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></notes><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar1" notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par57">The authors declare no competing interests.&#x000a0;Disclosure R.B. and Y.P. are founders and stock holders R.S. and A.D. are option holders</p></notes></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation-alternatives><element-citation id="ec-CR1" publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Short- and Long-Term risk of lead dislodgement events: Real-World experience from product surveillance registry</article-title><source>Circulation: Arrhythmia Electrophysiol.</source><year>2002</year><volume>15</volume><issue>8</issue><fpage>e011029</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1161/CIRCEP.122.011029</pub-id></element-citation><mixed-citation id="mc-CR1" publication-type="journal">Qin, D. et al.
