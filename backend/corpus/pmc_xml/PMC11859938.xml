Leaflets from three trifoliate leaves were pooled to form composite samples for each exposure time and evaluated at the following evaluation times: 0 h, 20 min, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h. In the initial phase of infestation (20 min), an oxidative burst was observed, represented by prominent hydrogen peroxide accumulation rather than superoxide radicals. This oxidative burst occurred in parallel to a strong increase in the antioxidant activities of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>-transferase, but not in that of superoxide dismutase. These changes likely reflected an enhanced activation of signaling pathways involved in the oxidative stress response. After this initial phase, from 20 min to 6 h, a prominent decrease occurred in catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>-transferases activities, despite the hydrogen peroxide levels remaining significantly elevated, along with a marked but transient increase in the reduced glutathione content and proline. Interestingly, superoxide dismutase activity increased significantly after 6 h in parallel to lipid peroxidation, whereas the content of hydrogen peroxide remained elevated until 12 h of infestation. By the final evaluation, after 48 h of infestation, some redox indicators remained altered in relation to control plants, but in a state of moderate redox stress. Thus, in an unprecedented way, our data suggest that <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic> infestation triggered a moderate oxidative stress response in soybean plants.

Introduction</title><p>Plants are challenged by severe threats resulting from climate change, including the increased frequency and intensity of abiotic (i.e., lack or excess of water, pH, and salinity) and biotic (i.e., pathogens and herbivorous arthropods) stresses, which lead to crop damage and significant productivity losses [<xref rid="B1-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In soybean [<italic toggle="yes">Glycine max</italic> (L.) Merril] cultivation, for instance, regardless of the cropping system, <italic toggle="yes">Mononychellus planki</italic> (McGregor), <italic toggle="yes">Tetranychus ludeni</italic> Zacher, and <italic toggle="yes">T. urticae</italic> Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) have been increasingly reported in recent years [<xref rid="B5-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Plants and arthropods coexist and interact in numerous ways. One possible interaction is herbivory, considered deleterious, which involves a sophisticated system of herbivore perception and the activation of constitutive or induced defenses [<xref rid="B6-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this relationship, plant plasticity is directly related to their highly developed and refined sensory system, capable of rapidly activating defense and signaling mechanisms, allowing plants to perceive, memorize, and continuously learn [<xref rid="B8-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>It is well known that plant immunological recognition begins with Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), which monitor the presence of biotic factors through different types of elicitors, such as herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs), pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS), and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In these ways, herbivores are capable of inducing alterations in membrane potential (Vm) and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influxes and triggering the production of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref rid="B11-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by various organelles, including apoplasts, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and others [<xref rid="B12-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These molecules function as extremely rapid and efficient signaling agents. Specifically, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) can quickly traverse cells via aquaporins and peroxiporins [<xref rid="B13-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. ROS levels are generally regulated and maintained within appropriate ranges by the enzymatic defense machinery, particularly ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) [<xref rid="B12-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, plants under biotic stress often exhibit uncoordinated and highly complex redox responses [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This complexity arises because herbivores, in addition to causing mechanical injuries, often secrete chemical compounds, including elicitors that induce defenses and effectors that suppress or modulate them [<xref rid="B11-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B15-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For instance, <italic toggle="yes">Bemisia tabaci</italic> (Genn.) suppresses H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated signaling processes in tomato <italic toggle="yes">Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L. plants via a ferritin effector (<italic toggle="yes">BtFer1</italic>) [<xref rid="B17-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similarly, <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic> infestation reduces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content in soybean plants, a process closely linked to elevated APX activity [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In fact, plants under biotic stress exhibit APX as an important peroxidase, responsible for converting H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into H<sub>2</sub>O or O<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="B16-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>It is well known that ROS, when their homeostatic balance with antioxidants is disrupted, can lead to oxidative stress and, consequently, irreversible damage. In fact, ROS levels fluctuate over time, along with enzymatic and non-enzymatic defenses [<xref rid="B19-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], characterizing different redox or homeostatic states. Thus, when analyzed from a spatiotemporal perspective over short periods, these fluctuations can provide a sophisticated indication of the oxidative stress stage in which plants find themselves [<xref rid="B9-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. That is, after the transient state in homeostasis triggered by environmental disturbances, plants may exhibit the following three stress stages: I&#x02014;moderate stress, with no impact on essential functions; II&#x02014;chronic stress, where the disturbance may collapse the plant and lead to death; and III&#x02014;eustress, involving memory activation and resistance via epigenetic mechanisms in response to mild stresses [<xref rid="B9-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To date, most studies have sought to understand disturbances in redox homeostasis over long infestation periods [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. While these time intervals may be appropriate for the proposed objectives, they are evidently not effective in capturing the rapid signaling processes that precede the activation of defense mechanisms immediately after and throughout the infestation period. As a result, they do not accurately reflect the actual oxidative stress stage that the plants are in, nor do they indicate possible modulations caused by infestations.</p><p>In fact, it is well understood that redox metabolism plays a central role in plant&#x02013;environment interactions, including signaling cascades of varying intensities, both locally, where the herbivore causes injury, and systemically, in other regions/modules that have not been attacked [<xref rid="B20-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, ROS are involved in processes such as stress response, defense, recovery, memory, and tolerance [<xref rid="B9-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, our hypothesis is that biochemical indicators related to the redox metabolism, evaluated in a time-course with short time intervals, may be an appropriate methodology for inferring the oxidative stress stage of soybean plants infested by <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic>. We anticipate that during the infestation (A) ROS levels will peak upstream, acting as important signaling molecules; (B) antioxidant defense components (both enzymatic and non-enzymatic) will neutralize ROS; and finally, (C) the infestation will result in low levels of lipid peroxidation, indicating a state of moderate redox stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-14-00590"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-plants-14-00590"><title>2.1. Tetranychus ludeni Triggers an Oxidative Burst in Soybean Plants at the Onset of Infestation</title><p>The infestation by <italic toggle="yes">Tetranychus ludeni</italic> in soybean plants triggered an intense and short-term signaling process, possibly mediated by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Indeed, in the plants infested by <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic> (IT), the increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels began 20 min after the initial phase of infestation (ti), reaching a peak 6 h after ti (25% higher than control plants (CT)). On the other hand, 48 h after ti, unlike in CT plants, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels consistently decreased in IT plants (13% lower than CT plants) (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A; <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00590" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>). Regarding superoxide radicals (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup>), although the levels were similar between treatments, a notable peak occurred 24 h after ti, beginning to decline after 48 h (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B; <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00590" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>). In parallel, both IT and CT plants showed an increase in lipid peroxidation levels, especially 6 h after ti. However, a rapid accumulated oxidative effect, possibly caused by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, resulted in a significant increase in lipid peroxidation indicated by TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), particularly in IT plants, 24 h after ti (22% higher than CT plants), returning to levels close to CT plants 48 h after ti (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C; <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00590" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>The rapid oxidative burst observed in IT plants was evidently associated with regulation in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defense components. This was demonstrated by the activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase (CAT), which increased significantly at 20 min ti, by 277% and 195%, respectively, compared to CT plants, followed by a sharp decline (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A,B; <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00590" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>). In other words, although APX activity remained higher in IT plants 6 h after ti, similar levels to CT plants were reached 12 h and 24 h after ti, returning to an increase 48 h after ti by 42% compared to CT plants. Similarly, CAT reached levels comparable to CT plants as early as 6 h after ti, increasing again 12 h after ti by 40% compared to CT plants, and remained stable with small fluctuations until the end of the experiment. Finally, it can be stated that oxidative and antioxidant responses are triggered in the first minutes of <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic> attack, progressively decline, and eventually reacquire a new redox state close to the initial one, which can be classified as an altered but reversible homeostatic state.</p><p>The activity of other important enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>-transferase (GST), was also evaluated, and they showed fluctuations different from those observed in APX and CAT in IT plants. For example, SOD was stimulated in IT plants, especially 48 h after ti, reaching levels 43% higher compared to CT plants (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C; <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00590" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>). Thus, considering the later stimulation of SOD activity, corroborated by adequate levels of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> concentration, it is evident that <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic> infestation was not able to cause intense disturbances in this homeostasis. Regarding GST activity, IT plants showed a significant increase at 20 min ti, 64% higher compared to CT plants (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D; <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00590" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>), gradually decreasing until reaching similar levels to CT plants 6 h after ti. These levels remained stable until 24 h after ti, at which point, interestingly, GST activity in CT plants significantly increased compared to IT plants, peaking 48 h after ti.</p><p>As a non-enzymatic defense component necessary for GST activity, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels increased in IT plants, reaching values 34% higher than CT plants (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A; <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00590" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>), particularly at 6 h after ti. Interestingly, 48 h after ti, while CT plants showed an increase in GSH levels, IT plants experienced a decrease in such levels, leading to a significant difference between treatments. This temporal reduction in GSH levels, coupled with the low GST activity, suggests that <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic> infestation in soybean plants triggers functional constraints between the substrate and the enzyme. Another key non-enzymatic defense component, proline, unexpectedly increased at 6 h after ti, being 12% higher in IT plants compared to CT plants (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B; <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00590" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>). However, proline levels in IT plants returned to those of CT plants by 12 h after ti, indicating a rapid cell protective response to the intense signaling process induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-plants-14-00590"><title>2.2. A General Perspective</title><p>The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) explained 64.7% (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00590" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>) and 74.1% (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00590" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>) of the total variance. In fact, although the PCA explained a substantial portion of the variance, the residual variance may contain additional biological variation not captured by the first two principal components. However, this residual variance does not diminish the patterns observed in the graphs. For IT plants, the variance explained by Principal Component 1 (PC1/Dim1) was 37%, and by Principal Component 2 (PC2/Dim2), 27.7%, with variations primarily associated with the activity of the enzymes CAT, APX, and GST, as well as the content of proline, soluble protein, and O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup>. For CT plants, PC1/Dim1 explained 61.4% of the variance and PC2/Dim2, 12.7%, with variations mainly related to the activity of GST and APX, protein content, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Considering these key variables, IT plants showed distinct responses at different evaluation times after infestation. At 20 min ti, the responses were related to the activity of APX and CAT. At 6 h, the responses were associated with GSH content. At 12 h, the responses were linked to TBARS, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> levels. At 24 h, the responses involved proline content. At 48 h, the responses were dominated by SOD activity. For CT plants, most variables&#x02014;particularly at 24 h after ti, were associated with TBARS, GSH, proline, SOD, and O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup>. These findings strongly support that <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic> infestation induces an intense and rapid oxidative activity closely tied to antioxidant responses.</p><p>To provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between biochemical indicators of the redox metabolism and to reveal how homeostasis tends to adjust, a Pearson correlation analysis was conducted considering all evaluation times combined, capturing both positive and negative associations within each treatment (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A,B; <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00590" ref-type="app">Table S2</xref>). This analysis revealed a neutral scenario in IT plants, strongly indicating a balanced and adaptive response. Positive correlations were particularly evident between GST and CAT with APX and SOD and O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> with lipid peroxidation (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A; <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00590" ref-type="app">Table S2</xref>). Conversely, in CT plants, a predominance of positive correlations was observed, likely reflecting natural oscillations, which were especially pronounced between GST activity and other defense enzymes such as SOD and CAT, as well as among SOD, CAT, APX, and proline with ROS and lipid peroxidation (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B; <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00590" ref-type="app">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>In the heat map, the four main subclusters indicated by the Grouping Column, along with the dendrogram, corresponded to different evaluation times of redox responses in both IT and CT plants (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A,B). Thus, in IT plants, the dendrogram structure revealed similarities between redox responses at 48 h and 12 h after ti. An isolated cluster was formed at 0 h, indicating that before the onset of infestation, the plants&#x02019; redox responses were distinct from those at other evaluation times, especially from those at 48 h and 12 h after ti. Interestingly, in CT plants, the dendrogram structure differed completely from that of IT plants. The dendrogram revealed strong similarities, particularly between redox responses at 20 min ti and 0 h, as well as between 48 h and 24 h. Additionally, redox responses at 6 h were more similar to the subcluster of redox responses at 20 min ti and 0 h. The subcluster formed by redox responses at 48 h and 24 h was the most distinct. These results align with those observed in the PCA analysis. For instance, in CT plants, 6 h is close to 20 min ti and 0 h, whereas in IT plants, 48 h is close to 12 h, and 0 h forms a distant and isolated ellipse from the others.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-plants-14-00590"><title>3.

Although this led to an accumulated oxidative effect (lipid peroxidation), it ultimately resulted in a new stage, moderate oxidative stress, which highlighted an efficient defense and signaling process of the plant.</p><p>It is well known that tetranychid mites, when feeding, suck out the cellular content, especially from the active mesophyll cells [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In fact, important organelles are either sucked out or damaged, leading to the appearance of chlorotic lesions and a reduction in the photosynthetic rate in leaf tissue [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although this study did not assess the long-term effects due to the short observation period, in prolonged infestations, photosynthetic indices tend to decrease and are associated with increased concentrations of ROS [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this process, the accumulation of ROS occurs rapidly through the reduction of O<sub>2</sub> by electrons generated mainly in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes [<xref rid="B12-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, the elevated levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> observed in infested plants in this study, especially between 20 min ti and 12 h, are possibly, in part, a response to mechanical injuries. However, it is important to highlight that secretions injected during feeding may also contribute to this accumulation.</p><p>Although the literature lacks information, it is known that xenobiotics secreted by herbivores, such as elicitors and effectors, can trigger several unexpected responses in the signaling processes of their host plants [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B16-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. That is, various peptides secreted in herbivore saliva can directly modulate the metabolic adjustments of host plants [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this context, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has recently been recognized as a potential marker for responses related to elicitors, such as HAMPs, and effectors [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For example, in plant&#x02013;mite interactions, tetranin (Tet2), a protein elicitor identified in the salivary glands of <italic toggle="yes">T. urticae</italic>, was capable of triggering ROS accumulation in beans (<italic toggle="yes">Phaseoulus vulgaris</italic> L.) [<xref rid="B11-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Based on our results among the ROS evaluated, unusually, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was the first and only species accumulated in soybean plants infested by <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Tetranychus urticae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic> are species within the same genus, sharing morphological characteristics indicative of strong similarity [<xref rid="B21-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, considering that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been an effective signaler for responses associated with HAMPS [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], it is likely that <italic toggle="yes">Tet2</italic>-like proteins found in <italic toggle="yes">T. urticae</italic> are also present in the salivary glands of <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic>. This hypothesis could help to explain the results observed in this study; however, confirmation requires future investigations to identify and characterize the salivary proteins of <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic>, with a particular focus on their potential roles as elicitors.</p><p>From a homeostatic balance perspective, to infer oxidative stress stages in plants [<xref rid="B9-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], we demonstrated that O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> was not accumulated in infested plants, whereas H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed a consistent increase up to 6 h after ti, followed by a gradual decrease after this time. Indeed, an increase in lipid peroxidation levels also occurred, particularly at 24 h after ti. Apparently, this relationship between H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and lipid peroxidation is repeated in other studies involving the plants&#x02019; redox responses to phytophagous mite infestation [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. More specifically, in the case of soybean plants infested with <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic> for 14 and 24 days, ROS accumulation and lipid peroxidation were not confirmed in the apical region of the plants [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Generally, lipid peroxidation is triggered initially by the formation of lipid alkyl radicals through hydrogen abstraction primarily by hydroxyl radicals (OH&#x02022;) from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), followed by the formation of conjugated dienes and peroxyl radicals that propagate lipid chain damage, and ultimately, radical termination, producing stable molecules such as malondialdehyde (MDA) [<xref rid="B23-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For example, OH&#x02022; is predominantly generated from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through the Fenton reaction [<xref rid="B12-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, the rapid increase and subsequent gradual decline in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels observed in our results strongly characterize a sufficient and robust antioxidant defense mechanism to cope with and mitigate oxidative stress induced by <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic>.</p><p>Oxidative enzymes such as SOD commonly represent the first line of defense against O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> in the apoplast, which is often produced by electrons donated from NADPH oxidase to molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) [<xref rid="B13-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This essential mechanism of SOD can be inferred from our results, which indicated a homeostatic balance between SOD and O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> in infested plants. This suggests that soybean plants can preserve this redox balance even under infestation. As a result of this homeostasis, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production becomes evident due to the dismutation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> by SOD [<xref rid="B12-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this context, CAT, APX, and some GSTs, as well as GST-dependent peroxiredoxins, are crucial peroxidases that act simultaneously to dismutate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into H<sub>2</sub>O [<xref rid="B25-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. While CAT and APX are produced in various organelles, they are predominantly found in peroxisomes. Catalase eliminates large amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, whereas APX fine-tunes low H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels, enabling efficient signaling processes [<xref rid="B25-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Based on our results, both enzymes exhibited an initial burst, indicating that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was indeed induced during the early moments of infestation but efficiently neutralized afterward. On the other hand, although GST activity showed an initial increase in infested plants, it subsequently remained relatively constant, suggesting that redox homeostasis demand was predominantly managed by CAT and APX. From this perspective, CAT and APX can also be considered potential targets for the development of plants more tolerant to these infestations.</p><p>A possible modulation by infestation cannot be ruled out. Among the few studies available in the literature, recent evidence has demonstrated that a GST (<italic toggle="yes">GSTU43</italic>) can regulate lignin biosynthesis in tomato plants, reducing stress caused by salinity [<xref rid="B26-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is well known that lignin acts as an effective physical defense barrier against both abiotic and biotic stresses, including mites [<xref rid="B27-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, the reduction in GST and GSH levels observed in our results could partially be explained by the ability of <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic> to manipulate genes related to this metabolic pathway, as suggested by Wurlitzer et al. [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This mechanism could benefit mites by facilitating the feeding process. Considering another important non-enzymatic stress-mitigating component, proline is an essential amino acid in plant cells that plays a role in protein biosynthesis, osmoprotection, and homeostatic regulation [<xref rid="B28-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Specifically, in homeostatic maintenance, proline is known to effectively combat OH&#x02022; [<xref rid="B29-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In our results, for the first time in the literature, soybean plants infested with <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic> exhibited an increase in proline content alongside elevated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels, strongly indicating the elimination of OH&#x02022; through the Fenton reaction. Moreover, the fact that proline levels in infested plants quickly returned to those of control plants may help to explain the results of Wurlitzer et al. [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which showed no accumulation of ROS or proline in the apical region of soybean plants evaluated at least 14 days after infestation. This highlights the plant&#x02019;s ability to quickly reestablish homeostasis, even under infestation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-plants-14-00590"><title>3.2. Who Regulates Whom?</title><p>Based on the scenario of our results, together with the contribution of the variables from the multivariate analysis, it was revealed that the main antioxidant enzymes were intensely orchestrated in the initial minutes of infestation in an attempt to achieve homeostatic adjustment in the infested plants, preventing more severe disturbances. This fact is clearly corroborated and complemented by the dendrogram of the heat map analysis, in which, shortly after the onset of infestation, the indicated redox responses still resembled the initial state, with visible changes especially at the end of the evaluations, which manifested a state of moderate redox stress. This new state characterized a stage of moderate oxidative stress, similar to that proposed by Silveira and Sousa [<xref rid="B9-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], that was confirmed by the correlation analysis, which showed a state of neutrality among ROS, oxidative enzymes, and lipid peroxidation in the infested plants.</p><p>From this perspective, numerous studies depict a scenario of an &#x0201c;arms race&#x0201d; in plant&#x02013;herbivore interactions [<xref rid="B30-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this dynamic, while herbivores secrete elicitors and effectors, a cascade of signals, primarily mediated by ROS and hormones, is activated in host plants, triggering toxic or anti-nutritional properties against the predator [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B32-plants-14-00590" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, the state of moderate redox stress observed here may not necessarily represent only an endogenous plant response. Instead, it could also reflect an adjustment induced by the mite to delay stress and keep the plant alive, ensuring food and shelter for an extended period (<xref rid="plants-14-00590-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-plants-14-00590"><title>4.

Conclusions and Perspectives</title><p>Considering redox homeostasis as an indicator of stress stages in plants is a complex challenge. In this study, we evaluated the time-course over a short term in young soybean plants, focusing particularly on oxidative stress. Unprecedentedly, we detected a moderate oxidative stress stage in soybean plants infested by <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic>. In the early minutes following infestation, an intense transitional state was evidenced by an oxidative burst, primarily triggered by the action of CAT and APX enzymes, alongside high levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, promoting an aggressive signaling process. As a result of this signaling, an accumulated oxidative effect was observed, manifesting mainly through lipid peroxidation 24 h ti. Interestingly, even in the continuous presence of mites, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were consistently attenuated, and lipid peroxidation returned to normal levels 48 h after the onset of infestation. Furthermore, while GST and GSH levels decreased, APX activity resumed at low levels, along with SOD, leading to moderate redox stress by the absence of significant oxidative stress and a balanced signaling process. Based on these unprecedented discoveries, we can highlight the following two topics to be considered innovative for the area of plant physiology and management of <italic toggle="yes">T. ludeni</italic> in soybean crops:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study demonstrates that soybean plants under infestation by phytophagous mites exhibit a moderate redox stress or a new redox state characterized as a non-significant stressful oxidative. This condition reflects the plants&#x02019; intrinsic physiological ability to withstand infestation without significant damage. This finding is extremely relevant in the current agricultural context, as it opens the possibility of reducing the use of pesticides in soybean management. Thus, producers can adopt strategies based on cultural practices to control these phytophagous mites, promoting a more sustainable and cost-effective approach to agricultural production.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Additionally, it was observed that antioxidant enzymes, particularly APX (ascorbate peroxidase) and CAT (catalase), displayed extremely rapid responses within the first minutes following infestation. Notably, this is the first study to demonstrate such immediate antioxidant defense mechanisms related to the redox metabolism of soybean plants under a biotic factor. These findings have significant potential to support biotechnological and breeding programs aimed at developing more tolerant cultivars. Exploring these rapid antioxidant responses may become a critical tool for enhancing plant tolerance to biotic factors, contributing to food security and the sustainability of modern agriculture.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Although this study has brought essential information on plant&#x02013;pest interactions, further studies are needed, particularly those exploring longer infestation periods, which are strongly recommended. Such studies should encompass comprehensive evaluations of biomass levels, including both aerial parts and roots, as well as productivity indices, to provide a more in-depth understanding of plant responses. Additionally, research should investigate the capacity of mites to manipulate plant defenses, with a special focus on identifying and characterizing potential elicitor and effector secretions. To achieve these insights, the application of molecular tools is crucial, enabling detailed analyses of the biochemical and genetic pathways involved.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) for their financial support and research fellowships (CNPq No. 310146/2023-2); to Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior&#x02014;Brasil (CAPES); to the University of Taquari Valley&#x02014;UNIVATES for research support, Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Pr&#x000f3;-Sementes (FPS), for having made soybean seeds available, and and to Luana Fabrina Rodighero for reviewing the English of the manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

In a non-stressed state, plant cells without infestation exhibit biochemical indicators at a baseline intensity (0 h), configuring a fundamental redox state. Upon infestation, mechanical injuries and xenobiotic compounds (elicitors and effectors) secreted by the mites trigger an oxidative burst characterized by increased levels of oxidants and antioxidants, with elevated activities of CAT, APX, and GST neutralizing high levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. As a result of this severe homeostatic disturbance, an intense apoplast-mediated signaling process occurs between cells (20 min ti&#x02013;6 h). Subsequently, during a transitional yet less aggressive state, the accumulated oxidative effect, marked particularly by lipid peroxidation, is triggered. Moreover, although H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is partially mitigated, CAT maintains an intense activity, tending to readjust homeostasis (12 h&#x02013;24 h). Finally, despite the ongoing infestation, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels consistently decrease. However, since GST and GSH are modulated by the infestation, APX resumes low-level activity, along with SOD, resulting in a new redox state similar to the initial one (state of moderate redox stress), reestablishing normal-intensity signaling processes (48 h). The side boxes indicate the intensity of biochemical indicators related to redox metabolism. The bar beneath the cells indicates the intensity of redox homeostasis oscillations: initial homeostasis&#x02014;a non-stress scenario (0 h); oxidative burst&#x02014;severe homeostatic disturbance (20 min ti to 6 h); reversible recovery&#x02014;an intermediate homeostatic state between intense and weak stress (12 h to 24 h); and a new redox state&#x02014;similar to the initial one (48 h).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="plants-14-00590-g007" position="float"/></fig></floats-group></article>
