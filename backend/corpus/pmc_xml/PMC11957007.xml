This unregulated response to self is fuelled by heightened metabolic programmes, which offers a promising new direction to uncover novel treatment strategies. &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-hydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11) is a mitochondrial hydrolase that maintains the catalytic function of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (&#x003b1;-KGDH), and its expression in CD4+ T cells has been linked to remission status in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the importance of ABHD11 in regulating T cell metabolism and function &#x02013; and thus, the downstream implication for autoimmunity &#x02013; is yet to be explored. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of ABHD11 dampens cytokine production by human and mouse T cells. Mechanistically, the anti-inflammatory effects of ABHD11 inhibition are attributed to increased 24,25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC) biosynthesis and subsequent liver X receptor (LXR) activation, which arise from a compromised TCA cycle. The impaired cytokine profile established by ABHD11 inhibition is extended to two patient cohorts of autoimmunity. Importantly, using a murine model of accelerated type 1 diabetes (T1D), we show that targeting ABHD11 suppresses cytokine production in antigen-specific T cells and delays the onset of diabetes <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. Collectively, our work provides pre-clinical evidence that ABHD11 is an encouraging drug target in T cell-mediated autoimmunity.</p></abstract><abstract id="ABS2" abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="P6">

This anabolic switch supports effector function, providing the necessary precursors for cytokine production and blastogenesis. Failure to appropriately regulate T cell activation culminates in autoimmunity, whereby augmented T cell function is driven by alternate or heightened metabolic programmes<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Increasingly, altered mitochondrial metabolism within the T cell compartment is being implicated in the onset of autoimmunity. For instance, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), CD4+ T cells lack mitochondrial aspartate, which disrupts the regeneration of metabolic cofactors required for ER sensor modification, to become enriched in rough endoplasmic reticulum capable of producing large amounts of TNF&#x003b1;, driving inflammation within surrounding tissues<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. This arthritogenic phenotype arises from mitochondrial malfunction, whereby mitochondrial DNA damage uncouples oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) from ATP production<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, whilst defective succinyl-CoA ligase function drives reductive carboxylation<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Indeed, TNF&#x003b1; itself is likely to be a major driver of these changes in mitochondrial metabolism<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a feature of many autoimmune conditions, as pathogenic T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be characterised by elevated levels of OXPHOS<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, whilst their counterparts in multiple sclerosis (MS) display reduced levels of mitochondrial respiration<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. These distinct modes of mitochondrial dysfunction highlight the metabolic heterogeneity that underpins autoimmunity.</p><p id="P8">Several leading immunosuppressants target the immunometabolic profile to modulate inflammation<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. For example, methotrexate has long been a first-line treatment of many autoimmune disorders, inhibiting key aspects of folate metabolism and nucleotide synthesis to limit immune cell function<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. However, a substantial proportion of autoimmune patients do not respond to methotrexate<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, whilst other treatments are often blighted by debilitating side effects<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. To this end novel treatment strategies have been developed. Both tetramerisation of pyruvate kinase<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and inhibition of ATP synthase<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> have improved disease outcomes in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models, harnessing the relationship between metabolism and autoimmunity for therapeutic benefit. Moreover, metabolic modulators such as 2-deoxyglucose and metformin have shown promise alongside traditional treatment strategies in lupus-prone mice<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, which, amongst other studies, has catalysed the repurposing of metformin in SLE<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, RA<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and multiple sclerosis<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> in clinical trials. Thus, there is substantial precedent for manipulating T cell metabolism to uncover alternative therapeutic agents that alleviate autoimmunity.</p><p id="P9">Molecular profiling has identified &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-hydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11) as one of the genes most associated with remission status in RA<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Specifically, reduced ABHD11 expression within patient-derived CD4+ T cells correlates with improved disease outcome and clinical remission<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. AHBD11 plays a peripheral role in mitochondrial metabolism, where it regulates the activity of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (&#x003b1;-KGDH), the rate-limiting enzyme within the TCA cycle, by maintaining functional lipoylation of its catalytic subunit, dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (DLST)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. In the absence of ABHD11 function, &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate (&#x003b1;-KG) accumulates and is subsequently converted to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which can inhibit the function of &#x003b1;-KG-dependent dioxygenases involved in epigenetic remodelling and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signalling<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Whilst 2-HG has previously been shown to suppress cytokine production and cytotoxicity in murine CD8+ T cells<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, the importance of ABHD11 function in human T cells has yet to be determined.</p><p id="P10">Here, we show that loss of ABHD11 function limits T cell cytokine production. Mechanistically, we demonstrate these changes are not attributed to a 2-HG epigenetic axis, rather an augmented oxysterol biosynthesis programme that arises following the accumulation of lactate and acetyl-CoA. To this end, heightened intracellular lactate promotes SREBP2 signalling, which upregulates sterol biosynthetic processes to drive the production of 24,25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC) via a mevalonate shunt pathway and subsequent activation of liver X receptor (LXR) signalling. Crucially, <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> pharmacological inhibition of ABHD11 suppressed T cell function in two autoimmune patient cohorts, whilst also attenuating disease activity in a murine model of autoimmunity <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. Together, these data demonstrate the potential of modulating ABHD11 function for therapeutic benefit in T cell-mediated autoimmune disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>ABHD11 is required for murine and human T cell effector function</title><p id="P11">Given that reduced expression of ABHD11 within CD4+ T cells is associated with remission in RA<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, we sought to better understand the role of ABHD11 in T cell biology. Firstly, we established the degree of ABHD11 protein expression in human CD4+ T cells, wherein ABHD11 was expressed at low levels in unstimulated T cells, but became notably upregulated upon TCR-mediated activation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine the importance of ABHD11 function, human CD4+ T cells were treated with ML-226, a highly-selective inhibitor that targets the active site serine of ABHD11<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, whilst concomitantly being activated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 24 h. Here, ML-226 significantly impaired cytokine production, with striking reductions in the release of IL-2, IL-10, IL-17, IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We also analysed underlying mRNA levels for <italic toggle="yes">IL17</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">IFNG</italic>, where comparable reductions were observed at the gene transcript level (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Although there were modest reductions in CD25, CD44 and CD69 expression following ABHD11 inhibition, the proportion of cells that upregulate the expression of these markers following TCR stimulation remained similar (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that early TCR signalling events are intact. Despite the loss of effector function, ABHD11 inhibition did not induce any notable reduction in T cell size (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), further demonstrating that early activation signals are unperturbed. In line with this, global protein translation, as measured by puromycin incorporation, was not significantly altered by ABHD11 inhibition (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, cell viability remained intact in T cells exposed to ML-226 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>), confirming that the observed loss of effector function is attributable to ABHD11 inhibition rather than compromised cell viability.</p><p id="P12">To further investigate the impact of ABHD11 function on T cell fitness, we activated murine T cells in the presence and absence of WWL222, a potent and selective inhibitor targeting ABHD11 in mice<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. WWL222 is structurally distinct from ML-226, containing a different chemical scaffold, and, importantly, targets an alternate region of ABHD11<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Specifically, murine T cells were polarised <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> towards distinct T cell lineages in the presence and absence of WWL222 to assess its subset-specific effect on cytokine production. As with their human counterparts, cytokine production was impaired by ABHD11 inhibition, with a reduction in both the frequency of IFN&#x003b3;-, IL-13- and IL-17-producing cells, as well as the quantity of each cytokine, under Th1-, Th2- and Th17-polarising conditions, respectively (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). Together, these data indicate that ABHD11 is essential for optimal T cell function.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ABHD11 inhibition rewires human T cell metabolism</title><p id="P13">Given that ABHD11 primarily maintains the function of &#x003b1;-KGDH within the TCA cycle<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, we next investigated the impact of ABHD11 inhibition on human T cell metabolism. Firstly, we assessed whether ML-226 directly inhibits the catalytic activity of &#x003b1;-KGDH. Although modest, we recorded a significant reduction in &#x003b1;-KGDH activity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that ML-226 can inhibit ABHD11 oxidative decarboxylation of &#x003b1;-KG in T cells. Subsequently, we activated T cells in the presence and absence of ML-226 and examined cellular metabolism using a mitochondrial stress assay. Here, there was a significant reduction in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) following ABHD11 inhibition, with consistent reductions in basal respiration, ATP-linked respiration, maximal respiratory capacity and spare respiratory capacity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). As expected, these changes precede impaired ATP production from OXPHOS (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, we utilised targeted mass spectrometry analysis to understand potential alterations at the metabolite level. Here, ABHD11 inhibition revealed a compromised TCA cycle, in which succinate levels were significantly reduced following ABHD11 inhibition, in addition to a striking accumulation of acetyl-CoA (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Although &#x003b1;-KG levels remain similar following ABHD11 inhibition (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), there is a marked increase in the observed &#x003b1;-KG / succinate ratio within these cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), further indicating impaired &#x003b1;-KGDH activity. However, intracellular 2-HG levels were unchanged (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that there is alternative mechanism underpinning the observed phenotype, rather than the epigenetic mechanism previously described following ABHD11 loss<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, the amino acid pool is also noticeably diminished in these cells, with observed reductions in glutamate, aspartate and asparagine (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Aspartate plays an important role in nucleotide synthesis<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>; therefore, it is unsurprising that there is a concomitant reduction in the production of several nucleotides following ABHD11 inhibition (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, mitochondria appeared to be larger in T cells treated with ML-226 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), though this translated into no discernible effect on mitochondrial depolarisation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). Equally, despite the reduced glutathione pool present in these cells, this had no effect on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">D</xref>). Taken together, there is substantial evidence that the TCA cycle is compromised following ABHD11 inhibition, altering the metabolic landscape within the mitochondria.</p><p id="P14">Given the impact on OXPHOS, we next determined whether ABHD11 inhibition perturbed lactic acid excretion, measured using the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). We observed a modest reduction in ECAR, whereby glycolytic capacity was attenuated by ABHD11 inhibition (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">K</xref>). This translated into a reduction in glycolytic ATP production (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>). However, these changes are not necessarily underpinned by depletion of the metabolite pool, as intracellular levels of glycolytic intermediates are not consistently changed following ABHD11 inhibition (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2E</xref>). A substantial increase of intracellular lactate levels was observed upon ABHD11 inhibition (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>). Importantly, the lactate accumulates within these cells, and is not exported at a higher rate (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N</xref>), which agrees with the modest reduction in extracellular acidification rate with ABHD11 inhibition (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">L</xref>).

To realise the biological relevance of these changes, we performed pathway enrichment analysis to determine which pathways become up- and downregulated upon ABHD11 inhibition. Unsurprisingly, several pathways associated with T cell function, such as <italic toggle="yes">cellular response to cytokine stimulus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">inflammatory response</italic>, were downregulated following ABHD11 inhibition (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), supporting our observed effects on cytokine production (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).

Given the multi-faceted roles of acetyl-CoA, we next examined whether its accumulation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) fuels increased histone acetylation. However, there were no observable differences in any of the histone acetylation marks measured following ABHD11 inhibition (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, global protein acetylation appeared to be unaffected in these cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>).

Therefore, given the heightened intracellular lactate levels we observe following ABHD11 inhibition (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>), we activated T cells in the presence of either ML-226 or lactic acid and assessed whether there was a comparable effect on cytokine production. Here, treatment with lactic acid phenocopied ABHD11 inhibition, with similar reductions in IL-2 and IFN&#x003b3; production (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>). These data suggest that lactate drives SREBP activation and the subsequent upregulation of sterol biosynthesis pathways.</p><p id="P18">To establish the significance of augmented sterol biosynthesis following ABHD11 inhibition, we next carried out specialised mass spectrometry to measure the intracellular levels of various sterol species. Surprisingly, we observed a reduction in total sterol levels following ABHD11 inhibition (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). This is primarily attributed to a reduction in non-oxygenated sterols, wherein there is a trend towards decrease across the group, with several significantly reduced (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>). Conversely, we identified heightened oxysterol levels within these cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), which in turn increased the oxysterol / sterol ratio (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). Of the oxysterols measured, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC) and 24,25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC) emerged as the two most significantly elevated species, particularly 24,25-EC whose levels are approximately 5&#x02013;10 times higher following ABHD11 inhibition (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Interestingly, there does not appear to be a general increase across all oxysterol species, as 7&#x003b1;-hydroxycholesterol (7&#x003b1;-HC) and 24-hydroxycholesterol (24-HC) levels were reduced upon ABHD11 inhibition (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Intriguingly, we report activation of a shunt pathway &#x02013; branching from the classical mevalonate pathway at oxidosqualene &#x02013; which synthesises 24,25-EC from acetyl-CoA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P19">27-HC and 24,25-EC are potent activators of liver X receptor (LXR) signalling<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.

As such, we hypothesised that LXR activation would phenocopy, at least partially, ABHD11 inhibition in human T cells. To this end, we treated T cells with ML-226 and GW3965 in parallel before assessing cytokine production. Here, we observed comparable reductions in IFN&#x003b3; and IL-2 production between ABHD11 inhibition and LXR activation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>), suggesting that LXR activation drives, at least in part, the anti-inflammatory phenotype observed in human T cells following ABHD11 inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>ABHD11 inhibition suppresses T cell effector function in autoimmunity</title><p id="P20">Our findings thus far have outlined that ABHD11 inhibition suppresses T cell effector function, underpinned by a compromised TCA cycle that promotes 24,25-EC synthesis and consequently activates LXR signalling.

Although SREBP activity is required for the metabolic programming that prime T cells for growth and proliferation<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, the impact of augmented SREBP activation has yet to be fully explored in T cells. A recent study has described a lactate-SREBP2 signalling axis, whereby dendritic cells exposed to increased levels of lactate within the tumour microenvironment promoted cholesterol metabolism through a SREBP2-dependent pathway<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.

In line with these studies, we show that following ABHD11 inhibition, there is an accumulation of intracellular lactate, with a concurrent upregulation of SREBP and sterol biosynthesis genes.

It is also important to note that LXR activation is closely integrated with SREBP signalling within inflammatory response programmes<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>.
