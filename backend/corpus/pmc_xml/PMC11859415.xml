Pericarditis was diagnosed at that time, and the patient commenced colchicine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). There was no medical or family history of note. The patient did have an&#x000a0;extensive travel history, including recent trips to Southeast Asia and North America. Two months later, he was admitted to our institution with collapse secondary to pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, and a left-sided pleural effusion. At that time, an emergency pericardiocentesis was performed. Computed tomography (CT) thorax demonstrated pleural and pericardial effusions but was otherwise unremarkable. Pleural fluid cytology from a thoracocentesis procedure was benign. The patient's symptoms responded to high-dose corticosteroids. Extensive autoimmune, infectious, and auto-inflammatory screening was conducted. A diagnosis of autoimmune pericarditis was reached, although autoimmune serology was negative. Anakinra was commenced during outpatient follow-up. Six months later, he presented to our institution with frank hemoptysis, malaise, and proximal limb myalgia.</p><p>Investigations</p><p>Routine blood work, including tumor markers, provided limited diagnostic yield (Tables <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Tuberculosis cultures were negative. Chest X-ray noted new multifocal nodular opacities in both lung fields, stable cardiomegaly, and no pleural effusion (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). CT thorax, abdomen, and pelvis (CT TAP) identified interval development of mediastinal calcified nodular lesions with mass effect on cardiac chambers, multifocal bilateral parenchymal nodular opacities with ground-glass halo suggestive of hemorrhage (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), and diffusely abnormal pericardium with areas of calcification and nodularity.

Zoledronic acid was added in the context of bone metastases to reduce the risk of bone pain, pathologic fracture, and spinal cord compression. Clinical examination showed gross resolution of dermal metastases shortly after commencing chemotherapy. Restaging CT TAP after three cycles of chemotherapy showed a significant reduction in tumor burden. A second restaging CT TAP post-cycle six confirmed a further reduction in pulmonary metastases, pericardial thickening, and hepatic lesions. Osseous metastatic disease was radiologically stable. Chemotherapy was then stopped for a treatment break, and the patient was followed on surveillance.</p><p>Three months after the completion of cycle six chemotherapy, the patient was admitted with left facial droop and left upper limb weakness. CT and MRI brain identified multiple new brain metastases (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). He commenced dexamethasone and received a course of whole-brain radiotherapy. CT TAP showed progressing lung, liver, and bone metastases. Weekly paclitaxel was initiated following the completion of radiotherapy. The patient experienced anemia and thrombocytopenia secondary to bone marrow suppression. A subsequent admission with acute back pain and increasing dyspnea identified an L1 vertebral pathologic fracture. MRI of the lumbar spine showed extensive osseous metastatic disease (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). CT TAP noted significant disease progression in the thorax and liver, with superimposed pneumonia (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

Patients can present with myriad symptoms depending on organ involvement. Early metastases are a feature of angiosarcoma, which often spreads to the lung, liver, and bone. Initial symptoms are frequently vague, including dyspnea, fatigue, weight loss, atrial tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope. Cardiac tamponade can also develop [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The nonspecific nature of these symptoms provides limited diagnostic insight and leads to a broad differential diagnosis. Our patient's presentation included chest pain, proximal myalgia, pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, and hemoptysis as presenting features.</p><p>Diagnostic imaging findings are nonspecific, especially in the setting of diffuse metastases. Case reports in the literature note the halo sign on CT thorax as a feature of lung metastases&#x000a0;in angiosarcoma [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The halo sign describes a ground-glass opacity surrounding a parenchymal lung mass and is reflective of alveolar hemorrhage and surrounding pulmonary infarction. It has a broad differential, including infections such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, sarcoidosis, primary lung neoplasms, and lung metastases&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Negative infectious, autoimmune, and auto-inflammatory screens narrowed the list of possible etiologies in this case. Approximately 80% of cardiac angiosarcomas originate at the right atrioventricular groove [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Other masses found in this location include atrial myxoma, thrombus, and cardiac metastases from another primary malignancy. A transthoracic echocardiogram, in our case, identified a mass at the right atrium and interatrial septum, providing further rationale for determining this patient to have a right atrial primary tumor.</p><p>Tissue diagnosis in cardiac angiosarcoma is often challenging to achieve, even in the setting of widespread metastases. Pericardial and pleural fluid sampling is often nondiagnostic&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Here, the diagnosis was reached following a punch biopsy of a cutaneous lesion identified on full skin examination. This avoided higher risk and more invasive sampling for tissue diagnosis, which had been planned. Diagnosis of primary cardiac angiosarcoma following a biopsy of a cutaneous metastasis is exceptionally rare. Two&#x000a0;cases of diagnosis via skin biopsy were identified in the literature&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Both cases described angiosarcomas that originated in the left atrium, whereas the present case originated in the right atrium.</p><p>Histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry provided key diagnostic insight in this case. Histological mimickers of angiosarcoma include Kaposi sarcoma, spindle cell hemangioma, epithelial carcinoma, and melanoma [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CD31 positive staining of the skin lesion biopsy confirmed the vascular lumen origin of the dermal metastases. Positive <italic>ERG</italic> immunohistochemistry is highly specific for both benign and malignant vascular tumors, including angiosarcomas and Kaposi sarcomas. The negative HVV8 test ruled out Kaposi sarcoma, aiding the correct diagnosis.</p><p>Discussion at the soft tissue sarcoma multidisciplinary team meeting determined that the primary tumor in this case originated in the right atrium. This decision was reached on consideration of the clinical and radiological features, as well as the histopathological and immunohistochemical assessment of the skin biopsy.</p><p>Metastatic angiosarcoma has a median overall survival of 3-10 months.&#x000a0;A consensus on treatment strategy has not been established to date, partly due to its rarity. Surgical resection can be considered in localized disease. Systemic chemotherapy options in the metastatic setting include doxorubicin and weekly paclitaxel. Targeted therapies that have undergone investigation in this setting include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors such as bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as apatinib [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].&#x000a0;Doxorubicin/ifosfamide chemotherapy induced a good response for this patient, albeit short-lived. There was some concern about using an anthracycline-based regimen given the potential cardiotoxicity of these agents and the underlying cardiac malignancy, which was impairing cardiac function. However, on discussion with the patient's cardiologist, it was felt he had good underlying cardiac reserve given his lack of any pre-existing atherosclerotic or other cardiac issues, so the oncologic benefits of anthracycline-based treatment were adjudged to outweigh the risks.</p><p>Molecular analysis of this tumor revealed an activating <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation as the oncogenic driver mutation for this tumor. The <italic>KRAS</italic> V14I mutation identified in our case has been described in a previously reported case of skin angiosarcoma&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Genetic alterations affecting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway have been noted in genomic analyses of angiosarcomas. In one study of 34 angiosarcomas, MAPK pathway alterations were identified in 53% of cases, including one tumor that was positive for a <italic>KRAS</italic> G12D mutation [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The development of appropriate <italic>KRAS</italic>-targeting drugs&#x000a0;may be a therapeutic avenue worth exploring for these patients through appropriately designed clinical trials. Early-phase clinical trials investigating <italic>KRAS</italic> inhibitors in participants with advanced or metastatic solid organ malignancies include the <italic>KRAS</italic> G12C inhibitor MK1084 [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]&#x000a0;and BGB-53038, a pan-<italic>KRAS</italic> inhibitor [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This case provides insight into the detection and management of a rare malignancy, which was diagnosed on punch biopsy of a cutaneous metastasis. This presentation of a rare cancer had a broad differential, requiring a considered physical examination and tissue sampling to reach the diagnosis. The development of cutaneous metastases in a case of right atrial cardiac angiosarcoma is noteworthy in the published&#x000a0;literature. Doxorubicin-based chemotherapy was used with some success despite the risk of cardiotoxicity in the setting of a primary cardiac tumor. CT imaging allowed for non-invasive monitoring of treatment response. Research on previously "undruggable" <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations may offer hope for patients in the future via clinical trial enrollment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Aonghus Joyce, Gr&#x000e1;inne Murphy, Cynthia C.
