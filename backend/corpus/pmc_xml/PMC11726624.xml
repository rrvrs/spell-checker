However, injecting sclerosing agents into blood vessels is technically challenging and often ineffective. Gel&#x02010;immersion EIS (GI&#x02010;EIS) may facilitate easier intravascular sclerosing agent injection by dilating the varices and enhancing scope stability by maintaining low intra&#x02010;gastrointestinal pressure. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this procedure. This retrospective study included 18 patients (14 men and four women; median age, 70 years; age range, 18&#x02013;83 years) who underwent GI&#x02010;EIS at Osaka Medical Pharmaceutical University Hospital between December 1, 2022, and January 30, 2024. Patients who were at least 18 years of age at the time of treatment were included. No patients were excluded from the study. Thirty&#x02010;four punctures were performed. The donor vessel angiography success rate was 88.2% (30 of 34 punctures). The clinical success rate was 94.4% (17 of 18 patients). Esophageal varices in most patients disappeared or were reduced by 1 month after treatment. Adverse events related to the procedure included fever (three patients) and chest pain (one patient); however, both were resolved with conservative treatment. No respiratory deterioration due to aspiration occurred during the procedure. The results of this study demonstrate that GI&#x02010;EIS is a safe, clinically feasible, and effective treatment option for prophylactic hemostasis of esophageal varices.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="deo270056-kwd-0001">digestive system endoscopy</kwd><kwd id="deo270056-kwd-0002">endoscopic injection sclerotherapy</kwd><kwd id="deo270056-kwd-0003">esophageal varices</kwd><kwd id="deo270056-kwd-0004">gel immersion endoscopy</kwd><kwd id="deo270056-kwd-0005">prophylactic hemostasis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-0001"><funding-source>None</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="4066"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>April 2025</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.5.4 mode:remove_FC converted:27.02.2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="deo270056-sec-0010"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Esophageal varices caused by portal hypertension, such as those that occur with cirrhosis of the liver,<xref rid="deo270056-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">

Prior to the procedure, the varicose vein was evaluated and cleaned using conventional endoscopic observation under insufflation. Then, an overtube (double type; TOP Corporation) was inserted, and the scope was removed. After attaching the modified pneumo&#x02010;activated EVL device (Sumitomo Bakelite Co.

After aspirating and degassing the air in the esophagus and stomach, the attached balloon was inflated to inhibit the varicose vein annulus. Subsequently, the gel was injected through the forceps channel to fill the esophageal lumen. When a sufficient amount of gel had accumulated, a puncture needle for EIS was inserted through the forceps channels. Then, the varicose vein was punctured under the gel. After confirming blood backflow, a contrast agent was injected to ensure proper contrast of the vessel. Next, the sclerosing agent, which comprised a mixture of 10% ethanolamine oleate (EO) and a non&#x02010;ionic angiographic contrast agent (iopamidole) diluted to a 5% concentration, was injected in the blood vessel using a 23&#x02010;gauge disposable puncture needle (Variceser type S; TOP Corporation).</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="deo270056-fig-0001"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Schemas and typical intra&#x02010;procedure images of gel&#x02010;immersion endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (GI&#x02010;EIS) and those of conventional EIS for comparison.

</xref> In this study, the technical success of EIS was defined as puncturing the varicose vein and injecting sufficient EO to confirm that the donor's vessel exhibited contrast under fluoroscopy. The clinical success of EIS was defined as the reduction or disappearance of esophageal varices following the procedure. The clinical outcome of EIS was classified into the following four categories according to the results of the endoscopic evaluation 1 month after the procedure: &#x0201c;disappearance&#x0201d;, indicating a decrease in the varicose vein form and the absence of high&#x02010;risk bleeding indicators, such as the RC sign; &#x0201c;reduction&#x0201d;, indicating a decrease in the varicose vein size without complete disappearance of the RC sign; &#x0201c;no change&#x0201d;, indicating the absence of differences after treatment; and &#x0201c;progressive worsening&#x0201d;, indicating worsening of varicose veins or the presence of the RC sign. The clinical success of EIS was defined as the reduction or disappearance of esophageal varices. Additionally, variceal recurrence referred to the occurrence of esophageal varices that required retreatment during the observation period.</p></sec><sec id="deo270056-sec-0070"><title>Endoscopy equipment and devices related to GI&#x02010;EIS</title><p>All GI&#x02010;EIS procedures were performed using a GIF&#x02010;H290T endoscope and an EVIS&#x02010;X1 endoscopic system (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd.). VISCOCLEAR (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Factory) was used as the gel product for GI&#x02010;EIS. When required, additional gel was added using an external irrigation tube during the procedure (ERCP&#x02010;Catheter; MTW Endoskopie W Haag KG). Conversely, saline solution was provided through a secondary water delivery tube with a water jet function. In other words, gel and water could be added independently through the additional tube and endoscope equipped with the water jet function, as necessary.</p></sec><sec id="deo270056-sec-0080"><title>Technique tips and troubleshooting</title><p>In contrast to the conventional EIS method, GI&#x02010;EIS often involves unique problems because the procedure is performed using gel. Schemas and images of these problems and countermeasures caused by the differences in refractive indices are shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270056-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. With the gel&#x02010;immersion technique, similar to the underwater technique, the endoscopic image is magnified and appears closer due to the difference in the refractive index. Consequently, the area that requires visualization to evaluate backflow after puncture may be out of frame or invisible. To prevent this, a certain margin between the tip of the scope and the puncture site is necessary. In our study, a puncture site 16&#x000a0;mm from the tip of the scope allowed the endoscopic image to include the site where the reverse hemorrhage was confirmed. When the pneumo&#x02010;activated EVL device (Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd.) was attached to the endoscope tip, the distance from the forceps channel to the device tip was approximately 15&#x000a0;mm; we used this point as a marker for puncture procedures.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="deo270056-fig-0002"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>(a) With the gel, the endoscopic image is magnified and appears closer because of the difference in the refractive index.

These procedures help reduce the refractive index difference, allow clear visualization of the needle lumen, prevent blood coagulation, and address the issue of air remaining in the lumen of the puncture needle. Care is necessary when performing multiple punctures during one session because air can enter the needle and cause total reflection. Air in the lumen causes total reflection in the outer tube of the needle due to the refractive index difference, thus obscuring the lumen of the needle and making it impossible to confirm the backflow of the blood. Representative endoscopic images obtained when total reflection occurred are shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270056-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="deo270056-fig-0003"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>Images of the total reflections.

We did not encounter any patients classified as grade C. During the procedure, the median number of varicose vein punctures was 2.0 (range, 1&#x02013;4 punctures). Overall, the total number of punctures was 34, and 30 (88.2%) successful donor vessel angiographies were performed. For two of the four cases involving unsuccessful punctures, the backflow of blood could not be identified due to the total reflex phenomenon. For the remaining two cases, puncture of the thin F1 varix resulted in vessel penetration and subsequent bleeding. The clinical success rate was 94.6% (17/18). Treatment&#x02010;related adverse events included fever in three patients (16.6%) and chest pain in two patients (11.1%).

EVL is technically simpler than EIS, but it is associated with a higher varicose vein recurrence rate.<xref rid="deo270056-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>11</sup>
</xref> Consequently, EIS is often preferred for large&#x02010;volume esophageal varices with a preserved hepatic reserve. Conversely, although EIS has a low recurrence rate, the difficulty of the procedure is generally considered greater than that of EVL. In particular, during variceal puncture and sclerosing agent injection, issues such as blood vessel penetration, which causes bleeding, and improper agent injection can occur. Additionally, patients&#x02019; body movements and esophageal peristalsis may dislodge the tip of the needle. The use of gel&#x02010;immersion techniques can lower gastrointestinal tract pressure, thus reducing body movement during the procedure. Additionally, the gel, which is cooler than air, may help reduce esophageal peristalsis.<xref rid="deo270056-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref> With the GI&#x02010;EIS method, the gel provides a consistently clear view and enables the procedure to be performed under stable conditions. Additionally, in the event of bleeding, the bleeding point can be detected relatively easily. Therefore, this very clear view and high stability of the scope with the GI&#x02010;EIS method may improve the difficulty associated with the puncture and needle fixation.</p><p>This study revealed the effectiveness and safety of the GI&#x02010;EIS technique as well as high intravascular angiographic and clinical success rates without serious complications. Although the use of gel may increase the incidence of aspiration complications, no patients in this study experienced aspiration pneumonia. Additionally, no patients experienced respiratory conditions that worsened during the procedure. This may be due to the inflation of the endoscope with a balloon for varicose vein compression, which prevented backflow into the oral cavity. The GI&#x02010;EIS results were comparable to the conventional EIS results, suggesting that the GI&#x02010;EIS method is a safe, clinically feasible, and effective treatment option for prophylactic hemostasis of esophageal varices.<xref rid="deo270056-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>, <xref rid="deo270056-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> The enhanced scope stability during puncture is likely attributable to the low intra&#x02010;gastrointestinal pressure maintained by avoiding air insufflation, which allowed adequate injection of the sclerosing agent, which, in turn, may be effective for large and continuous gastric varices.</p><p>However, GI&#x02010;EIS requires more staff than the conventional EIS method because of the need for intermittent gel injection. The use of an endoscope with a water jet function that injects gel through a secondary water&#x02010;delivery tube during esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection can reduce the risk of complications.<xref rid="deo270056-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref> At our hospital, we used a system that injects gel through an external irrigation tube (ERCP&#x02010;Catheter; MTW Endoskopie W Haag KG) with a water jet function during endoscopic procedures such as endoscopic hemostasis and endoscopic submucosal dissection. If additional gel was needed during the procedure, then it was added using a water&#x02010;delivery device (JW&#x02010;3 System; Fujifilm Co.) through an external irrigation tube. Conversely, a normal water supply was provided via a secondary water delivery tube. This allowed additional gel and water to be injected independently. Additionally, a foot pedal allowed the operator to add the gel; therefore, additional staff were not required. We hypothesized that this system could also be used for GI&#x02010;EIS procedures, thus addressing challenges associated with the need for additional staff.</p><p>Although we have demonstrated the feasibility of applying GI&#x02010;EIS for esophageal varices, this study had some limitations. First, this was a single&#x02010;center retrospective study that included a small number of patients. Second, the risk of varicose vein recurrence may not have been accurately assessed because of the short follow&#x02010;up period. Third, unfortunately, a detailed report of conventional EIS, including the experience of the endoscopist, number of punctures, and amount of sclerosing agent injected at the time of puncture, at our institution was not recorded. As a result, it was difficult to accurately compare the GEL&#x02010;EIS method with the conventional EIS method. Therefore, we do not yet recommend the widespread adoption of this technique for clinical use. However, we think that the effectiveness of the GI&#x02010;EIS method, with its very clear view and high scope stability, may contribute to an improved technical success rate. Further case studies and research are required to clarify these issues.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that GI&#x02010;EIS is a novel procedure that is safe, clinically feasible, and potentially effective for prophylactic hemostasis of esophageal varices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="deo270056-sec-0130"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec id="deo270056-sec-0140"><title>ETHICS STATEMENT</title><p>
