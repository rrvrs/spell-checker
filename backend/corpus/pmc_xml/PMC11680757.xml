</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0045">Venous thromboembolism (VTE) affects approximately 5% of the population in their lifetime, manifesting as 2 primary conditions: (1) pulmonary embolism (PE) and (2) deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT constitutes the predominant presentation in nearly two thirds of VTE cases, and its incidence and prevalence have steadily increased worldwide in recent decades.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The pathophysiology of VTE, along with the predisposing factors, aligns with the Virchow triad, encompassing venous stasis, vascular injury, and hypercoagulability.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Common risk factors for DVT include local infection, external compression, trauma, medications such as estrogen-containing drugs, immobilization, recent surgery, obesity, and inherited conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome, with more than 95% of DVT cases occurring in the lower limbs. Lower limb DVTs typically originate in the calf, with approximately three fourths resolving spontaneously; however, 25% progress to involve the proximal leg veins, where nearly half of these cases can embolize, leading to PE.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Patients with identifiable risk factors for PE are labeled as provoked PE, whereas others are termed as unprovoked PE, and these patients may require further workup including testing for thrombophilia and/or screening for malignancy.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Despite recent technologic advancements, PE remains the third most common cardiovascular disease globally and one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity, with even higher mortality among the elderly and patients with associated comorbidities especially cancer, with a 1-year fatality rate after VTE approaching 23.0% in a recent study.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p id="p0050">Our case report describes of a young man who developed extensive left leg DVT after being initiated on glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA) to facilitate weight loss.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Case Report</title><p id="p0055">A 20-year-old young man presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of pain and swelling in his left leg. He described the pain as sharp, rating 7 out of 10 in intensity, with radiation to the thigh and back. He reported no history of trauma or any family history of thromboembolism. Recently, he had started Mounjaro (tirzepatide) on a private prescription, taking 7.5&#x000a0;mg weekly, with the intention of losing weight to meet the physical requirements for selection in security services. Over the past 3 weeks, he had lost 10 kg. His medical history included glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and childhood asthma, for which he did not require any regular medication. He had been previously admitted several times for low back pain secondary to lumbar disc prolapse (confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging), managed with analgesia, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms.</p><p id="p0060">Upon examination, he was in no apparent distress, and his vital signs including pulse rate and blood pressure were within normal limits. His chest was clear, and there were no cardiac murmurs heard. No palpable abdominal masses or abdominal tenderness was noted. His left thigh exhibited swelling, tenderness, and mild redness, with a left mid-thigh circumference of 33.5 cm compared with 30.5 cm (a difference of 3 cm) on the right side. Additionally, the left calf was swollen, measuring 2 cm larger than the right.</p><p id="p0065">Lower limb venous Doppler studies confirmed extensive DVT involving the left common iliac, external iliac, common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and great saphenous veins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig</xref>.). <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> summarizes initial laboratory investigations of the patient.

This trend can increase the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea and the risk of dehydration. Despite both dehydration and morbid obesity being well-recognized risk factors for VTE, comprehensive evaluation for other VTE risk factors in these patients is often overlooked when initiating GLP1-RA treatment.</p><p id="p0085">Our case serves to alert practitioners about the signs and symptoms of DVT that should be monitored upon starting GLP1-RA therapy. The precise mechanism responsible for the increased risk of DVT, whether attributed to rapid weight loss induced by these agents or dehydration resulting from gastrointestinal side effects, remains unclear. However, this uncertainty should be explained to patients, and a standard risk assessment, including past medical and family history of VTE and medication history, should be conducted before initiating GLP1-RA treatment. After starting GLP1-RA treatment, the patients who develop rapid weight loss should be monitored closely for side effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Statement of Patient Consent</title><p id="p0090">Informed consent was obtained from the patient ethical approval was taken from Tawam Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee with approval number MF2058-2023-993.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosure</title><p id="p0095">The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Goldhaber</surname><given-names>S.Z.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Venous thromboembolism: epidemiology and magnitude of the problem</article-title><source>Best Pract Res Clin Haematol</source><volume>25</volume><issue>3</issue><year>2012</year><fpage>235</fpage><lpage>242</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.beha.2012.06.007</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22959540</pub-id>
