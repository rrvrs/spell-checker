Here, we describe two cases of relapsing MS (RMS) treated with a second course of cladribine. Both patients were initially diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome and later enrolled in the ORACLE-MS and CLASSIC-MS studies. After receiving cladribine in ORACLE-MS, neither patient required additional treatment until RMS was diagnosed 8-10 years later. In each case, a second course of cladribine was administered, and both patients remained without clinical or radiological disease activity as per their most recent assessments (November 2023 and August 2023, respectively). No serious or unexpected adverse events were reported during follow-up. These cases provide further real-world evidence of the long-term effectiveness&#x000a0;and safety of cladribine after a second course of treatment in patients with RMS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>case report</kwd><kwd>cladribine</kwd><kwd>immune reconstitution therapy</kwd><kwd>long-term effectiveness</kwd><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>Medical writing assistance for the preparation of this article was funded by Merck.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by demyelinating lesions with axonal loss as the disease progresses [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] as well as various physical and cognitive symptoms [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cladribine is an immune reconstitution therapy that selectively and transiently reduces CD19+ B- and T-cell levels, leading to the reconstitution of adaptive immune function [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In patients with MS, cladribine tablets (10 mg) are given as a cumulative oral dose of 3.5 mg/kg over two years (i.e., 1.75 mg/kg/year, separated by 12 months) [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Each treatment course comprises two weeks per year (five days of treatment weekly), one at the beginning of the first month and another at the beginning of the second month. If medically necessary (such as for recovery of lymphocytes), the treatment course in year 2 can be delayed for up to six months. Typically, after two years of cladribine therapy, no further treatment is required in years 3 and 4 [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The ORACLE-MS study (NCT00725985) investigated the effect of cladribine on conversion from clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) to clinically definite MS in adults [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In these patients, cladribine significantly delayed the conversion to clinically definite MS compared to placebo. A post-hoc analysis of the ORACLE-MS trial assessed the effect of cladribine in patients with a first clinical demyelinating attack who met newer diagnostic criteria (i.e., McDonald 2017) [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Compared with placebo, cladribine 3.5 mg/kg significantly reduced the time to relapse or three-month confirmed expanded disability status scale (EDSS) worsening in patients with early relapsing MS (RMS) [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In October 2011, the ORACLE-MS study was terminated prematurely, at which time all cladribine administration was discontinued due to issues with the production of cladribine tablets. Following termination, all patients completed a 24-week safety follow-up with a final end-of-trial visit [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The long-term efficacy of cladribine tablets beyond four years has been previously described in several clinical trials and real-world studies. In the Italian CLARINET-MS registry, &#x0003e;50% of patients with MS who had received cladribine in clinical trials were relapse-free five years after their last dose [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the CLARITY and CLARITY-extension studies, cladribine showed benefits for up to six years, considering the gap between both studies in which no treatment was administered was a median duration of 40.3 weeks (range: 0.1-118) [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The phase IV CLASSIC-MS study (NCT03961204) prospectively evaluated the long-term efficacy, safety, and durability outcomes of cladribine treatment in patients who were enrolled in the parent studies (i.e., ORACLE-MS and CLARITY/CLARITY-EXT) [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. An analysis of the CLASSIC-MS study found that&#x000a0;during a 10.9-year follow-up period under routine clinical practice, 55.8% of patients who were treated with at least one dose of cladribine in the parent clinical trials did not require further disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, evidence of retreatment with cladribine in RMS is scarce [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Here, we present two case reports summarizing the clinical evolution of two patients (who presented consecutively) after receiving cladribine for early-stage MS in the ORACLE-MS study in 2010. Both patients subsequently entered the CLASSIC-MS study and experienced disease stability for 8-10 years until MS was retreated with a second course of cladribine, the outcomes of which are described here. A concise timeline of diagnosis, tests, and treatment is provided for Case 1 (nine years and 10 months between cladribine treatments) and Case 2 (eight years and two months between cladribine treatments) in the next section. The first demyelinating event occurred in July 2010 for Case 1 (monitoring continued until November 2023) and June 2010 for Case 2 (monitoring continued until August 2023). The duration of MS symptoms was 11 years and five months for Case 1 and eight years and one month for Case 2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>Case 1</p><p>A 45-year-old female, who had smoked approximately 12 cigarettes per day for 15 years before presentation and had a history of six pregnancies, three spontaneous abortions, and no drug use, presented to our facility in July 2010 with loss of strength and sensitivity in the right hemibody (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Timeline of diagnoses, tests, and treatment in Case 1</title><p>CIS: Clinically isolated syndrome; IM: Intramuscular injection; IVC: Intravenous contrast; MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging; MS: Multiple sclerosis; RMS: Relapsing multiple sclerosis; SE: Weighted-spin echo; T2-FLAIR: T2-weighted-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Date</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type of event/scan/treatment</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Results</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">06 July 2010</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1<sup>st</sup>&#x000a0;demyelinating event</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Loss of strength and sensitivity of the right hemibody</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">08 July 2010</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lumbar puncture performed</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Positive for oligoclonal bands</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 July 2010</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Standard cranial MRI study performed with usual multiplanar sequences, diffusion sequence, and after IVC in multiplanar projections included</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">High signal areas of the T2 sequence, predominantly a paraventricular lesion in the left atrium with involvement of the splenium of the adjacent corpus callosum; target morphology was a central area of higher signal intensity in T2 of approximately 12 x 8 mm, with a peripheral area of lower signal intensity in T2, high diffusion (without apparent coefficient restriction) and annular enhancement, discrete, and predominantly peripheral after IVC.

In accordance with the ORACLE-MS study protocol, she initially received cladribine 5.25 mg/kg (cumulative dose); the first dose was received on October 13, 2010. Cladribine was very well tolerated with no adverse events (AEs). Due to the premature termination of the ORACLE-MS study, the patient completed her end-of-trial visit on September 13, 2011.</p><p>In May 2012, she experienced a second demyelinating event, with a sensory-motor relapse of the left hemibody. She was diagnosed with MS and treated with dexamethasone for three days, after which she reported symptomatic recovery in June 2012. No disease activity occurred until October 2019, when two new lesions were discovered on a non-enhanced MRI scan, and RMS was diagnosed. A third demyelinating event (MRI scan identified a sensory-motor relapse of the left hemibody) in July 2020 was treated with a pulse of oral methylprednisolone. The patient received steroids because she did not wish to receive any MS-modifying treatment, as she wanted to become pregnant at the time.</p><p>Nevertheless, a second course of cladribine to treat RMS was started in August 2020, and disease activity did not resume.

He did not receive any treatment, and his symptoms had resolved after two weeks.

His lymphocyte count has remained normal as of August 2023.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The two cases described here involve patients who experienced their first relapse of MS as long as ~10 years (Case 1) and eight years (Case 2) after initial treatment for early MS with a single course of cladribine. Both were then retreated with a second course of cladribine for RMS, thus highlighting not only the long-term efficacy of the drug but also that retreatment is well tolerated.</p><p>An MS diagnosis can usually be made after a single clinical event, in conjunction with an MRI scan showing disease dissemination over time [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Early treatment initiation is essential, as initiation after the first clinical demyelinating event can delay the time until subsequent events or an MS diagnosis [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is well-established that early treatment initiation allows for prolonged disease control and better treatment outcomes [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Both patients reported here had initially received a CIS diagnosis. Notably, the McDonald criteria for MS diagnosis were updated after the ORACLE-MS study was initiated [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, some of the patients enrolled in the study at the time would have met the current diagnostic criteria for MS [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These results support the early use of cladribine in patients with CIS, which improves treatment outcomes for patients with MS overall. This is in line with previous MS studies showing that DMTs in both treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients and those who have switched from one previous therapy have better treatment outcomes with cladribine than those who switched from two or more previous therapies [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In line with data from the CLASSIC-MS study [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the two patients discussed in these case reports did not require further DMTs for at least 8-10 years after receiving an initial cladribine course (cumulative dose of 3.5 mg/kg), thereby confirming its long-lasting effects. In this sense, a recent expert consensus recommends that patients who had received two courses of cladribine (i.e., complete treatment) and were stable during years 3 and 4 may undergo annual MRI scans and, if available, neurofilament light chain measurement to monitor for disease reactivation [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. If RMS occurs, an additional course of cladribine should be offered (i.e., a cumulative dose of 7 mg/kg) [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The consensus also underlined that in the instance where clinical or radiological activity is absent but the patient presents with poor prognostic factors, cladribine retreatment should be considered as a preventative measure against disease progression; in cases where disease activity is higher than that observed before cladribine initiation, switching to another treatment should be considered [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The favorable efficacy and safety profile of cladribine results from its unique physicochemical properties, which produce selective long-term depletion of proinflammatory memory B cells [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and a modest reduction of regulatory B and T cells, thereby limiting disease progression by facilitating immune tolerance against self-pathogenic&#x000a0;cells and suppressing self-mediated inflammation [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Historically, T cells were considered the key immune mediators underlying the pathogenesis of MS; however, B cells are now recognized as central mediators, following observation of their presence in peripheral blood and CNS compartments in patients with MS [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Such evidence highlights the potential role of B cells in antibody and cytokine production&#x000a0;as well as antigen presentation [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Though cladribine also exerts modest effects on CD8 and plasma cells, their limited depletion allows for sustained and durable protection from infections. The innate immune system remains unaffected by cladribine [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The two-year MAGNIFY-MS study, in which patients with active RMS were treated with cladribine, showed that long-term reductions in proinflammatory B-cell cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6+) and T-cell cytokines (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma) paired with increases in anti-inflammatory T-cell cytokines (IL-4+) led to the re-establishment of immune tolerance required for long-term MS control. Additionally, novel results indicated increases in CD16low CD56bright and NKp46 cell populations [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Cladribine has an acceptable safety profile in adults with RMS [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The most frequently occurring cladribine-induced AE in this patient population is transient lymphopenia due to the selective depletion of lymphocytes [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In both cases reported here, Grade 1 lymphopenia occurred after the second course of cladribine but did not warrant treatment modification or discontinuation. Similarly, a post-hoc exploratory analysis of the CLARITY, CLARITY-extension, and ORACLE-MS studies found that CD19+ B-cell and CD4+/CD8+ T-cell counts decreased after cladribine 3.50 mg/kg treatment but had recovered to normal levels by the end of the study year [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These results further support the use of cladribine as an effective and generally safe long-term therapy for patients with RMS compared with other DMTs. Short dosing schedules and low monitoring requirements make cladribine an attractive therapeutic option for treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients and those who relapse (as well as those who are stable but experience AEs) on moderately effective DMTs [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, to reduce the risk of cladribine discontinuation due to AEs, patients should be encouraged to follow health guidelines, such as routine cancer screening [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These case reports describe the treatment of MS that only relapsed 8-10 years after receiving one course of cladribine treatment. After the second course of cladribine, both patients remained clinically stable with no disease activity, although low-grade lymphopenia was observed.
