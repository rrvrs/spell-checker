However, their use carries potential risks. Vigilant monitoring and patient engagement are crucial when initiating antipsychotics.</p></sec><sec id="sec0949"><title>Objectives</title><p>To explore whether comprehensive discussions with patients concerning the benefits and risks of antipsychotics are taking place, and whether baseline investigations are performed before initiation of antipsychotics as per NICE guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="sec0950"><title>Methods</title><p>This retrospective study focused on admissions to a male acute ward between March 1 and May 31, 2023. Data from electronic patient records included demographics, Mental Health Act (MHA) status, psychiatric diagnoses, medical co-morbidities, documentation of medication benefits / side effects discussions with patients, medication information provision, as well as baseline investigations involving weight, height, waist/hip circumference, pulse, blood pressure, blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, prolactin levels, movement disorder assessment, nutritional status, diet, physical activity, and ECG.</p></sec><sec id="sec0951"><title>Results</title><p>Among 23 admitted patients, 15 were newly initiated or reintroduced to antipsychotics, with 14(93.3%) admitted under the MHA. Primary diagnoses included Paranoid Schizophrenia (33.33%), Unspecified Non-Organic Psychosis (20%), Bipolar Affective Disorder (20%), and others. Medical comorbidities were observed in 10(66.7%), notably type 2 diabetes (40%). Among initiates, 6(40%) were new to treatment, while in 9(60%) it was re-initiated.</p><p>Within the 15-patient group, discussions on treatment benefits engaged 11(73.3%), while 4(26.7%) lacked complete documentation. Only 6(40%) had discussions about side effects. Metabolic side effects were discussed with 3(20%), extrapyramidal effects with 2(13.33%), while 4(26.7%) had general side effect talks. Patient information leaflets were given to 5(33.3%) patients. Baseline measurements: 12(80%) had weight/height, 4(26.7%) waist/hip, and 14(93.3%) pulse/blood pressure assessed. Blood tests were declined by 4(26.7%). Baseline glucose, HbA1c, lipids, and prolactin were assessed in 8(53.3%), 10(66.7%), 9(60%), and 8(53.3%) patients respectively. Nutritional status was assessed in 13(86.7%), movement disorders in 1(6.7%), and physical activity in 1(6.7%). All 15(100%) patients were offered ECGs, although 5(33.3%) declined.</p></sec><sec id="sec0952"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Adherence to NICE guidelines for baseline investigations and risk/benefit discussions prior to antipsychotic initiation was low, apart from ECGs, weight/height, pulse/blood pressure, assessment of nutritional status, and discussions about antipsychotics&#x02019; benefits. Implementing effective monitoring and patient engagement to mitigate potential side effects, is crucial to facilitating the safe and efficient utilisation of antipsychotics.</p></sec><sec id="sec0953"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
