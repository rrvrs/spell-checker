ARDS is an inflammatory process where there is endothelial damage in lung tissues leading to fluid accumulation warranting immediate attention for intensive care of the patient for its recovery [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].&#x000a0;Silent hypoxemia is another term for happy hypoxia.

RT-PCR&#x000a0;is a process of detecting the virus in the laboratory from a nasal swab, and&#x000a0;if it comes back positive, the patient is deemed infected with the virus. He was not having many symptoms other than a high fever, but his home pulse oximetry reading showed 87%, for which he rushed to the hospital. Upon examination, his pulse was recorded at 114 beats per minute, blood pressure measured 110/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation was 82% in ambient air and improved to 97% when on oxygen, and his temperature was 98 degrees Fahrenheit. Auscultation of the chest revealed bilateral crackles. The examination of other systems showed no remarkable findings, and there were no indications of respiratory distress.</p><p>The patient was admitted to the&#x000a0;Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on April 27, 2021, with the aforementioned symptoms.

It has been observed that patients experiencing happy hypoxia tend to have a worse prognosis if early detection and management of the issues are not addressed properly [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Numerous pathophysiological mechanisms and hypotheses have been suggested to explain the phenomenon of happy hypoxia in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis. Dhont et al. identified several potential contributors to hypoxemia in patients who do not exhibit significant respiratory distress, including intrapulmonary shunting, impaired regulation of lung perfusion from hypoxic pulmonary artery vasoconstriction, microthrombi in the bloodstream, and diminished diffusion capacity in the lungs [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While there has been criticism regarding the role of microthrombi in causing hypoxemia, the use of enoxaparin has become a standard treatment for patients with elevated D-dimer levels, particularly those admitted to the ICU [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Duarte et al. proposed that autonomic interoception could be a factor leading to happy hypoxia; however, cadaver studies indicated minimal involvement of the vagus or glossopharyngeal nerves [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Swenson et al. have discussed the potential causes of happy hypoxia to include vasoplegia, as well as abnormal sensing of oxygen levels both peripherally and centrally due to the direct effects of the virus [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. UR et al. suggested a neural hypothesis, proposing that the virus could travel to the nucleus tractus solitarius via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, resulting in various symptoms, with happy hypoxia being one of them [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. According to Wenzhong et al., in instances of happy hypoxia, there is a compromise in hemoglobin, and the immune cells are affected by the production of reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The laboratory assessment of our patient aligns with the initial worsening characterized by elevated TLC, reduced lymphocyte levels, and increased LDH, CRP, IL-6, procalcitonin, ferritin, and D-dimer. Mardani et al. identified elevated LDH, CRP, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and neutrophils as indicators of SARS-CoV-2 infection in their research [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In a systematic review of 30 articles from PubMed, Kermali et al. concluded that low lymphocyte and platelet counts are indicative of a severe presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Terpos et al. have similarly noted that decreased lymphocyte levels, along with elevated LDH, CRP, IL-6, procalcitonin, ferritin, and D-dimer, frequently occur in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the patient described above, there was also an increase in lymphocyte count and a decrease in neutrophil count, TLC, IL-6, ferritin, CRP, and D-dimer, coinciding with the patient&#x02019;s recovery.</p><p>Tocilizumab, despite being in the early stages of randomized controlled trials to demonstrate its effectiveness against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, has displayed lower mortality rates and quicker recovery in a few other studies. Acting as an IL-6 receptor antagonist, tocilizumab has a reasonable mechanism of action by mitigating the effects of the IL-6 surge in the body, which underpins its application in SARS-CoV-2 treatment [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our patient also exhibited significant improvement, transitioning from BiPAP to a high-flow mask within two days. There was a rapid decline in IL-6 level in one week. It might be due to tocilizumab being an IL-blocker in addition to the decrease in the inflammatory processes leading to a decrease in acute phase reactants and chemical mediators in a course of treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, happy hypoxia can be misleading not only for the general public but also for healthcare professionals when assessing a patient. Timely identification, proactive management, and immediate treatment with the current standard therapies, such as tocilizumab, remdesivir, and plasma therapy, alongside diligent monitoring and maintaining adequate oxygen levels, can be critical for survival. Additionally, it is essential to document the support required by the patient, particularly when dealing with severe&#x000a0;SARS-CoV-2 cases. The contributions of physicians, nurses, caregivers, physiotherapists, psychologists, nutritionists, family members, and social support, as well as fostering self-belief to enhance morale, are undeniably important.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Jeevan K.
