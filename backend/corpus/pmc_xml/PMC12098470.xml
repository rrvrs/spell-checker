Therefore, in this study, the disinfection efficiency for viruses and bacteria and the change of indoor thermal comfort parameters (temperature, humidity, pressure) and air pollutants (CO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, VOC, O<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>O, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, Particle Number (PN) from 0.3 to 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m particle sizes) by a portable indoor air cleaner using the needle point bipolar ionization (NPBI) method were investigated. The highest antibacterial activity was achieved at hour 3 with a 99.8% reduction for <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 99.8% for <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 98.8% for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and 99.4% for <italic>Staphylococcus albus</italic>, and sustained at hour 4th. The ions had antiviral activity on surfaces with a 94% TCID50 reduction of the HCoV-229E virus after 2&#x000a0;h of NPBI-on. No significant changes were detected in thermal comfort parameters, NO<sub>2</sub>, and VOC during the NPBI-on. Moreover, it was found that O<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub>O were not generated when the NPBI system was operated in the room for 4&#x000a0;h. Consequently, an average particle number removal rate of 60% can be achieved with the NPBI system in much less time than with the natural decay time.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11356-025-36441-0.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Needle point bipolar ionization</kwd><kwd>Antibacterial</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Air purification</kwd><kwd>Indoor air</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Istanbul University Cerrahpa&#x0015f;a</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of T&#x000fc;rkiye (T&#x000dc;B&#x00130;TAK).</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">After the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the disinfection and sterilization of indoor environments have become more essential. Severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads through the air and can remain in the form of aerosols for a long time and be transmitted over long distances (Van Doremalen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2020</xref>). In addition, the virus was determined in the range of 0.25&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;m aerosol size. Depending on the ambient temperature and humidity, these aerosols can stay in the air for hours (3&#x02013;4 h) (Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>) and can be transported up to 4&#x000a0;m (Sultan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>). As a result, efforts have accelerated to develop a new technology that will both inactivate viruses and reduce other indoor pollutants.</p><p id="Par3">Various indoor air-cleaning devices use the technologies of mechanical filtration, ultraviolet light (UV), electrostatic filtration (ESP), photocatalytic processes (PCO), and cold plasma generators (Szczotko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2022</xref>). These can be used for removing or reducing the particulate matter (PM), volatile organic carbons (VOCs), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria (Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Mart&#x000ed;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>). The commonly used technology is mechanical filtration due to advantages such as being widely available, relatively low-cost, high-rated efficiency and excellent extraction capabilities for low particle sizes with HEPA filters and no additional emission of by-products. The second technology is the ESP which has a high efficiency (82&#x02013;94%) depending on the ionizing power and filter types, and low-pressure drop, and low maintenance requirements. UV technology is only effective at high intensity with sufficient contact time and is more effective for the inactivation of microbes on surfaces. The PCO has been preferred to reduce gaseous pollutants (e.g., aldehydes, aromatics, alkanes, olefins, halogenated hydrocarbons) commonly with adsorbent media to improve effectiveness. Due to some disadvantages of these techniques such as the specified operating life of the filter and the microorganism&#x02019;s accumulation within the structure of the filter for mechanical filtration, the harmful photochemical effect on humans (D&#x02019;Orazio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>) and damaged materials (Teska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2020</xref>) when directly exposed to UV radiation and the requirement cleaning for ESP, ionization technologies are becoming increasingly popular.</p><p id="Par4">There is not yet a standard test procedure for electronic technologies that have been increasingly used in recent years to improve indoor air quality and disinfection. However, an important concern with electrically powered air cleaning devices is by-products (Formaldehyde: CH<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>3</sub>). It is stated that it is essential to ensure the principle of being &#x0201c;ozone-free&#x0201d; when using these technologies (ASHRE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2011</xref>). Although ionization and oxidation methods have many unknowns in practice, technology is rapidly evolving, and more reliable indoor methods are being developed. One of these is the needle point bipolar ionization (NPBI) method.</p><p id="Par5">Although there have been many studies on the effectiveness of the ionization method for removing surface (Meschke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2009</xref>) and airborne bacteria (Hyun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>; Nunayon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>; Ratliff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2023</xref>) and particles (Pushpawela et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>; Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2015</xref>; Abu-Hammad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>), a few studies have been conducted by the NPBI method for removing pathogens and the potential of by-product formation in ventilation ducts (Zeng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2021</xref>; Licht et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>) and in transport (Baselga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2023</xref>). It was found that the disinfection effect in the aircraft was not satisfactory, but no by-products were produced, and the aircraft was not damaged (Licht et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>). Baselga et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2023</xref>) studied the efficiency of NPBI installed in the air conditioning unit of the Zaragoza Tram and found that the ionization with a filter in the air conditioning system reduced the concentration of colony-forming units (CFU) of bioaerosols by 46% and 69% after 30 and 60 min. But they did not obtain any benefit against microorganisms on the surfaces of trams. As in the use of the bipolar ionization system (Kormos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2024</xref>), it is seen that NPBI systems integrated into ducts did not reduce airborne pathogens efficiently. There may be a few reasons why these studies could not achieve an effective result. Since ions are very short-lived, they may work well when sprayed quickly on the target in the air stream. Disinfection applied to the duct system primarily targets the air that flows through it, with limited impact on the surrounding environment. OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> can be effective in microscale environments (Lakey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2021</xref>). Ambient humidity is an important factor in the effect of NPBI. As pointed out by the United States Environmental Pollution Agency (EPA), there are not enough studies in the literature on the NPBI method, so more evidence is needed on its effectiveness and the generation of toxic components (EPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2023</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Ionization systems can introduce by-products into the indoor air as well as alter existing components in the indoor air. The main indoor air quality parameters are carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), VOC, nitrous dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and PM. VOCs are mainly caused by building materials in the environment and come from outdoor air (Kozielska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Bari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>). NO<sub>2</sub> is mostly related to traffic and comes from outdoor air (Salonen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2019</xref>). Research conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic has identified indoor CO&#x02082; levels as a potential indicator of population density and, consequently, an increased risk of airborne infection. According to Minguillon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>), CO&#x02082; concentrations exceeding 800 ppm have been associated with a heightened risk of viral transmission in enclosed spaces. Fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) are predominantly found in indoor environments, and although indoor concentrations vary by location, they can reach levels 2 to 5 times higher than those in the outdoor environment (&#x0015e;ahin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2012</xref>; Yurtseven et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2012</xref>; Onat et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2019</xref>). Furthermore, Onat et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2017</xref>) identified a statistically significant correlation between <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacteria and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in crowded public vehicles. Therefore, the change in these parameters should be considered when using a disinfection device for indoor air.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, an NPBI device designed for viruses and bacteria inactivation was systematically evaluated to determine its efficiency in air disinfection and its potential as a portable indoor air purifier without any filters. The findings of this research aim to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on air purification technologies and provide insights into the applicability of NPBI as a viable solution for improving indoor air quality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Description of the NPBI devices</title><p id="Par8">In this study, an indoor air purifier device using the NPBI technology was used in the experiments, and the photo of the device can be seen in Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>a in the supplementary. This was produced by Ba&#x0015f;ar&#x00131; Incorporated Company. The device has &#x0201c;needles&#x0201d; as electrodes made from carbon fibers and attached to the flexible circuit. The device has three different stand fan operating speeds which are 2.68 m<sup>3</sup>/min, 3.26 m<sup>3</sup>/min, and 3.88 m<sup>3</sup>/min. NPBI technology is uniquely different from other ionization systems due to it does not use a dielectric and the power output is controlled to less than 12.07 eV to prevent the formation of O<sub>3</sub>. The energy required to ionize oxygen in the air should be above 12.07 eV to produce O<sub>3</sub> (Waddell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2019</xref>; Krull et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>). The water vapor in the air is ionized to hydrogen (H<sup>+</sup>) and hydroxide ions (OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) by NPBI. Ions released from the device remove hydrogen from the pathogen, as positive and negative ions surround air particles containing pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria, mold spores). In the case of a virus, hydrogen is pulled from the protein shell or capsid. Hydrogen is an essential component of the true structure of the viral protein coat, and without it the virus cannot be infective. In the case of bacteria, when the hydrogen is removed, the cell ruptures and the pathogen die, thus preventing infection.</p><p id="Par9">Total ions released from the NPBI device with the highest fan speed were measured using the ion measurement device (AlphaLab Air Ion Counter, AIC2M) at different distances and the results are shown in Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>b. The highest total ion amount (20.10<sup>6</sup> ions/cm<sup>3</sup>) was observed at 15 cm airflow distance from the device. When the measurement was made at a 1 m distance, this value decreased to &#x0003c;&#x02009;1.10<sup>6</sup> ions/cm<sup>3</sup>, which corresponds to indoor air conditions. Moreover, the measurements presented that the ions assume their highest values in the direction of the airflow and do not exceed 1.10<sup>6</sup> ions/cm<sup>3</sup> at the vertical and lateral distances of 15 cm from the device.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Experimental design</title><p id="Par10">For the experimental phase of the study, the effectiveness of a portable air purification system including only the NPBI technology was tested for airborne <italic>Human Coronavirus 229E</italic> and four different bacterial species; <italic>Escherichia coli ATCC</italic> (American Type Culture Collection) 10536 (<italic>E. coli</italic>), <italic>Staphylococcus aureus ATCC</italic> 653 (<italic>S. aureus</italic>), <italic>Staphylococcus albus</italic> 8032 (<italic>S. albus</italic>) and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> ATCC 9372 (<italic>B. subtilus</italic>). In addition, the change in indoor air quality (NO<sub>2</sub>, VOC, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and particle numbers from 0.3 to 10 &#x000b5;m diameter: PN<sub>0.3&#x02013;10</sub>) and thermal comfort parameters (temperature, humidity, pressure, CO<sub>2</sub>) were tested. Moreover, it was tested whether the NPBI system can form oxidative by-products (O<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub>O) during continuous long-term operation in a closed indoor environment. This is the first study to test all aspects of the NPBI system for use as a portable air purifier for all parameters together. Each of the tests of bacteria, viruses, and indoor air quality parameters was conducted in different study areas. The tests were performed in nationally accredited laboratories or university laboratories specialized in these analyses.

In the experimental protocol, 2.5 &#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> TCID50/mL HCoV-229E in 100 ml DMEM was used. The viral reduction efficiency of the NPBI device was carried out in a different cabinet than the bacterial study. The device was operated at the highest fan setting. The cabinet was a PVC and plexi-proof cabinet with dimensions of 103 cm, 195 cm, 91 cm. Before the study, the sealing tests of the cabin were checked, and the cabin was in the biosafety level 2 laboratory. Besides, the level of ions in the cabin was measured before starting the experimental protocol.</p><p id="Par12">Two sonic nebulizer devices producing aerosols with a diameter of 0.5&#x02013;6 &#x000b5;m were placed in the cabin to generate an aerosol at a rate of 10 ml/10 min, and device outlets were arranged to be within 10 cm of the cabin ceiling.

For this purpose, the experiments were conducted under closed conditions in an empty 20 m<sup>3</sup> office room on the second floor of the building (there is only a small wooden table on which the measuring instruments are placed). The building is located near the arterial road. Separate tests were performed under the condition of three different stand fan operating speeds of the NPBI device (WM1: work mode of 1&#x02009;st stage: 2.68 m<sup>3</sup>/min; WM2: 2nd stage: 3.26 m<sup>3</sup>/min; WM3: 3rd stage: 3.88 m<sup>3</sup>/min). The parameters monitored in indoor air are the PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, VOC, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>O, O<sub>3</sub> humidity, temperature, pressure, and particle number (PN) of 0.3, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10 &#x000b5;m sizes. Thermal comfort and air quality parameters were measured by a NEMo XT Indoor air quality monitor (ETHERA, France) which is an online air quality analysis station and has all air quality parameters sensors selected in this study. Designed to be permanently wall-mounted, it is electrically powered. Compatible with IoT or wired networks, it is easy to install in any type of building. The measurement range and accuracy (in brackets) of the parameters measured during the experiment are 0&#x02013;280 ppb (down to 1&#x000a0;ppb) for CH<sub>2</sub>O, 0&#x02013;5000 ppm (&#x000b1; 50 ppb) for CO<sub>2</sub>, 30 ppb-5 ppm (&#x000b1; 40 ppb) for VOC, 0&#x02013;1000 &#x000b5;g/m<sup>3</sup> (&#x000b1; 10 &#x000b5;g/m<sup>3</sup>) for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 1&#x000a0;ppb-17 ppm (&#x000b1; 15 ppb) for NO<sub>2</sub>, 1&#x000a0;ppb-7.6 ppm (&#x000b1; 15 ppb) for O<sub>3</sub>.

This is an active sampling method, and the pump and sampling O<sub>3</sub> tube no are Kitagawa/AP-20 Aspirating Pump and 182U, respectively. By attaching inorganic gas sampling tubes to this pump, samples are taken in short periods (3&#x02013;5 min) and the concentration is determined from the colour change scale in the tubes. We aimed to use this sampling method to check the O<sub>3</sub> concentration by the standard method. The measurement range and detection limit of this method dependent on the O<sub>3</sub> tube was 0.025&#x02013;0.05 ppm and 0.01 ppm, respectively. Furthermore, particle number counts were performed using the Lighthouse HandHeld 3016 particulate matter counter.

In order not to change the air circulation and concentration in the room, the room was neither entered nor left, and all electrical on/off operations were controlled from the side of the room door.

Figure S4 shows the change in indoor parameters, e.g., relative humidity, air temperature, air pressure, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The air changes per hour (ACH) provided by the unit in rooms for WM1, WM2, and WM3 are approximately 8, 10, and 12, respectively. For infection control in hospitals, it is recommended that the ACH should be between 4 and 6 (Allen and Ibrahim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2021</xref>). In the COVID-19 procedure, the use of natural or mechanical ventilation or portable air cleaners with an ACH of 6 and above reduces the risk of transmission (Allen and Ibrahim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2021</xref>; Minguillon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). For this reason, experiments were conducted in all three WMs and the change in parameters over time was observed. The p values of the <italic>t</italic>-test between the average values of the device-off (during an hour) and for each 1&#x000a0;h during the device-on were given in Tables S2. Table S2 and Figure S4 show that mostly there was no significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e; 0.05) between the NPBI device off (shown in dark colour in Figure S4) and on (shown in light colour in Figure S4) during 4&#x000a0;h for indoor air pressure and humidity. On the other hand, it can be observed that the indoor air temperature tends to increase, and p values are below 0.01. Regardless of the operation of the device, an increase in an ambient temperature of 1&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C occurred at the end of the 5-h measurement period in all three operating modes. It is assumed that the main reason for this is that the environment is completely closed, and heat exchange occurs due to the parameter-measuring devices operating in the environment.</p><p id="Par28">The average CO<sub>2</sub> level of the environment is in the range of 450&#x02013;500 ppm, which is slightly higher than the CO<sub>2</sub> level of an outdoor environment (420 ppm). When the NPBI device is put into operation, the CO<sub>2</sub> level in the indoor air increases slightly due to the person who was in to open the device and then gradually decreases so that at the end of 4&#x000a0;h it is 150&#x02013;200 ppm. There is mostly a statistically significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c; 0.05) in the 1-h averages when the device is switched on and off (Table S2). In the study conducted by (Ye et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2021</xref>), it was found that negligible CO<sub>2</sub> is formed by oxidation when air cleaners are used. Another reason for the increase seen in this study is that the very small amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) from traffic are likely to be present and may have converted to CO<sub>2</sub>. Subsequently, a reduction of 5&#x000a0;ppm CO<sub>2</sub> every 10 min (CO<sub>2</sub> decay rate =&#x02009;30 ppm per hour) was found to persist due to the OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> released by the device. The lifetime of OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> in the atmosphere is shorter than one second (Lakey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2021</xref>), and it is known that they play a role in reducing the important greenhouse gases such as O<sub>3</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) in the atmosphere (Vimbert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2020</xref>; Murray et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2021</xref>). The CO<sub>2</sub> reduction in the indoor air when using the NPBI device is something new in the literature and should be supported and explained by strong experiments, analysis, and reaction mechanisms for further studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Indoor air pollutants studies</title><p id="Par29">The main gaseous pollutant parameters in indoor air pollution are VOC and NO<sub>2</sub>. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the change in these gas concentrations when the NPBI device is in operation for 4&#x000a0;h. VOCs are mainly caused by building materials in the environment and outdoor air quality (Kozielska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Bari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>). In the study room, there is no office material (carpet, chair, furniture, etc.) that could be a source of VOCs, but there are VOCs that are entire because of outdoor air. When the room is empty, the VOCs are in the range of 350&#x02013;450 ppb. A small decrease was observed in the operation of the NPBI device, and at the end of the 4&#x02009;th hour there was a VOC reduction of about 100 ppb (~ 20%), especially in the 1&#x02009;st and 2nd hour (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c; 0.01, Table S2). When the NPBI device is put into operation, the VOC level in the indoor air increases slightly. It may relate to the person who was in to open the device and may relate to opening the door. Ye et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2021</xref>) investigated the VOC collection performance of some oxidation and adsorption-based portable air cleaners. They found that the removal of VOC by oxidation is very low, while adsorption is much more effective, and reactive VOC species (such as limonene) are important. The VOC reduction or increase in the indoor air when using the NPBI device, even if small, should be supported and explained by strong experiments and analysis by determining the species of VOCs and reaction mechanisms for further studies. Indoor sources of NO<sub>2</sub> are mostly related to outdoor air quality (Salonen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2019</xref>). In the case of the operation of the device, the formation of NO<sub>2</sub> is a situation that can only occur due to the oxidation of NO in the environment or the ionization of N<sub>2</sub>. The ionization eV of the NPBI device will not exceed 12 and the N<sub>2</sub> will not be degraded. As can be seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, at the end of the 4&#x02009;th hour, there was a slight decrease in the operating conditions of the 1&#x02009;st stage compared to the background of the room, but no important change.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Variation of NO<sub>2</sub> and VOC pollutants in the office room before and during the operation of NPBI device.

In the first 5&#x02013;10 min after switching on the NPBI device, there is a small jump, especially for very fine PMs (&#x0003c; 1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m), and then a decreasing trend starts. It is considered that this situation arises due to the condensation of gas molecules under the influence of negatively and positively charged ionization in the environment and particle formation or agglomeration processes of electronically charged particles with a size of nm. Particles between 0.1 and 1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m in the air are particles with accumulation mode, formed from the combination of fine particles by condensation, coagulation, and accumulation processes. Compared to the natural reduction after the first 30 min, the reduction of particle counts for the sizes from 0.3 to 0.5 &#x000b5;m was 1.5&#x02013;2 times greater (30&#x02013;60%) by operating the NPBI device.

Consequently, an average removal rate of 60% can be achieved with the NPBI system in much less time than with the natural removal of &#x0003c;&#x02009;1 &#x000b5;m.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>), the removal rates of aerosols with a diameter of 0.5&#x02013;2 &#x000b5;m increased by 72% because of corona discharge ionization. Very limited studies have pointed out that the ionization technique is moderate, and O<sub>3</sub> and UVC techniques are not effective in removing ultra-fine particles. In this study, we could not evaluate since we could not measure below 100 nm. However, our study shows that the effect of ionization technique on the change of particles in the air should be studied with more comprehensive and experimental studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>By-product studies</title><p id="Par33">The possibility that the operation of ionization systems may release some gases harmful to human health is the most important factor to consider. The most important of these gases are O<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub>O. According to a study by ASHRAE, indoor O<sub>3</sub> levels range from 2 to 25 ppb when a device that produces ions using the corona discharge method is turned off, while this level increases to 25&#x02013;40 ppb when the device is turned on (ASHRE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>). CH<sub>2</sub>O can be formed because of the reaction of terpenes and other VOC species, depending on indoor conditions, especially in the presence of indoor O<sub>3</sub>. They are formed by the reaction of oxygen radicals, probably released into the environment by ionization of gases, with O<sub>2</sub> and VOCs. The main advantage of NPBI systems is that they do not form oxygen radicals and do not produce O<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub>O gases. For this purpose, the instantaneous changes in O<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub>O concentration were measured by the continuous monitoring sensor. In addition, the O<sub>3</sub> presence was also tested using the reference measurement method, ASTM D 4490&#x02013;96.

The aim of this study is to demonstrate the use of the NPBI method as a portable indoor air cleaner through a multi-parameter study. The most basic mechanism in ionization systems is the enrichment of molecules in the environment with charge and then the formation of larger particles by the attraction of positive/negative charges and their separation from the environment. In addition, it is expected that the chemical structure of the gas molecules in the environment is changed, and a microbiological inhibition effect occurs. The known electronic ionization methods (ionization, ESP, etc.) can release a significant amount of O<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub>O into the environment, which may pose a risk to human health. To avoid this situation, NPBI systems have been developed that focus on the generation of much shorter-lived OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> instead of oxygen radicals with 12 eV energy. In the experiments carried out with a portable air purifier working continuously with this method for 4&#x000a0;h, the changes of numerous parameters in the indoor air were studied, and the main results are summarized as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par35">No more than 0.01 ppm O<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub>O were measured in the air,</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par36">The temperature increases by about 1&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, humidity decreases by about 2%, and there is no significant difference in ambient pressure,</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par37">The CO<sub>2</sub> level decreases by about 20% compared to the initial value,</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par38">VOC level decreases by about 20% from baseline,</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par39">NO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the environment does not change,</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40">PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration decreases by about 60% from baseline,</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par41">The number of particles with the size above 2.5 &#x000b5;m does not change significantly compared to the natural reduction,</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par42">After the 30 th minute after the start of the NPBI device, the number of particles with a size of 0.3 to 0.5 &#x000b5;m is reduced by 1.5 to 2 times compared to the natural reduction,</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">94.0% TCID50 reduction of the HCoV-229E virus were detected after 2&#x000a0;h of NPBI device operation,</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">The highest antibacterial activity was detected at hour 3 between 99.8% and 99.4%.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par45">This study has some limitations in general. Not all analyses could be performed in the same environment. Analyses could not be tried with more repetitions. The change in parameters with the change in ambient conditions was not considered. In the future, it will be useful to conduct detailed studies that will clarify the following: (i) NPBI systems should be tested at different indoor humidity and temperature values, (ii) the effect of the NPBI method on the size distribution of particulate matter needs to be studied with more experiments to cover a much wider size range of particulate matter; chemical and physical transformations should be described in detail, (iii) the real application range of furniture and goods should be studied and the VOC species/specification change should be investigated, (iv) although the study by Dong et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>) showed that air purifiers using ionization have a positive effect on the respiratory system but have a negative effect on heart rate variability (HRV), there is still no detailed study on the toxic effect of NPBI systems on human health. Multidimensional studies on the toxicological effect should be conducted.</p><p id="Par46">Supplementary information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="11356_2025_36441_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 1576 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to express our sincere thanks to Ferda Y&#x00131;ld&#x00131;z and Eren An&#x00131;l from Ba&#x0015f;ar&#x00131; A.&#x0015e;. for giving us the NPBI device (KAANPurelON patented with the number of TR 2020 18946 A2 approved in 2022/11/21) to use.
