This study aims to assess the Italian experience with the transition of patients affected by IMDs from pediatrician to adult care, focusing on the dietetic approach as well. For this purpose, a survey was created on REDCap&#x000ae; and distributed via email to the members of the &#x0201c;Dietetics and Nutrition Working Group&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Inherited Metabolic Diseases in Adults Working Group&#x0201d; of &#x0201c;Italian IMD and Newborn Screening Society&#x0201d; (SIMMESN); dissemination was possible with the collaboration of MetabERN.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">A total of 49 complete responses were collected-28 from medical doctors (MDs) and 21 from dietitians-from 35 different centers. Considering the MDs, 13 take care of pediatric patients; the remaining 15, with heterogeneous specialization, of adults with IMDs. Considering the dietitians, only 6 deal with IMDs patients as their full-time activity. Out of the 35 centers, 19 do not have a transition program (while 10/19 are already trying to implement it); the main barrier identified to the implementation voted by 42% of participants is represented by the lack of identification of a suitable facility. Considering the 16 centers that already have a transition program, the 2 main difficulties reported by 43% of participants were the lack of a psychologist for adult centers and the lack of specific training in IMDs on the adult service team; this last option was also the most voted by the dietitians (44%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">The administered survey allows us to capture the state of transition programs in Italy, the lack of homogeneity in those centers that already have one, and the obstacles to developing a new program. What unequivocally emerged is the need for standardization of the transition program and for delineating a path to train MDs specialized in treating adult patients with IMDs, as well as dedicated dietitians.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13023-025-03755-8.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adolescent health</kwd><kwd>Transition</kwd><kwd>Inherited metabolic diseases</kwd><kwd>Italian survey</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Institut National de la Sant&#x000e9; et de la Recherche M&#x000e9;dicale (INSERM) 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) are disorders caused by an enzyme defect in biochemical pathways affecting protein, lipid, carbohydrate metabolism, or impaired organelle function. Examples of IMDs include phenylketonuria (PKU), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), urea cycle disorders (UCDs), lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) such as Gaucher disease and Fabry disease, and mitochondrial disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. IMDs are complicated medical conditions, that often involve several organ systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Individuals with IMDs are complex patients who imperatively require integrated management by an experienced team in IMDs, including metabolic doctors, dietitians, nurses, and psychologists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The specific needs of each IMD will determine the appropriate tailored treatment for each disease. The pediatrician is essential in coordinating the multidisciplinary team during the pediatric age because many IMDs are diagnosed early at birth or during infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Dietitians play a fundamental role in treating IMDs: dietary therapy is often one of the primary treatments, regardless of age. It would be advisable for the metabolic team of each pediatric and/or adult center to have at least one dietitian trained and specialized in IMDs who can manage and support patients undergoing dietary treatment. Early identification and treatment of these pathologies significantly affect patients prognosis, improving life expectancy and preventing adverse outcomes. In addition, the correct nutritional approach, promptly began, prevents metabolic decompensation in these patients and its negative consequences for neuropsychological development, improving quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This is particularly relevant for small molecule disorders, for which dietary therapy is often the main treatment strategy; timely this is only possible through newborn screening (NBS) for those diseases for which it&#x000a0;is provided. Aging from childhood into adulthood is characterized by substantial biological, psychological, and behavioral changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; while this is true for the general population, it is even more pronounced in individuals with IMDs. Adolescence, in particular, often coincides with reduced adherence to nutritional and/or pharmacological therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Since 2016, by law, n. 167/2016, Italy has outlined itself as a leader in expanded NBS in Europe.&#x000a0;With the extended application of newborn screening and the continuous development and improvement of new treatments, patients affected by IMDs have significantly increased their life expectancy and getting out of the area of competence of the pediatric units that have traditionally treated them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Importantly, just a few decades ago, adult patients with IMDs were rare, and that is why, globally, health services have yet to find the best management for these patients properly. A good transition program, from pediatric units to centers specific for adults, has been the subject of attention to ensure optimal patient management and continuity of care. The aim is to attenuate the psychological (and therefore clinical) impact of changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Only through a successful and gradual transition program patients with IMDs can become fully independent and capable of taking life-long care of their health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As young adults transition into independent individuals, they take on the responsibility of managing their own healthcare, engaging directly with medical professionals, and making informed decisions about their treatment. This process should be actively supported by both healthcare providers and parents, who play a crucial role in fostering a seamless connection between the adolescent and the adult metabolic care team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recent work by the International Working Group on Gaucher Disease (IWGGD) in 2024 highlighted key aspects of the transition process in Gaucher disease type 1, emphasizing the importance of structured transition pathways and the need for multidisciplinary involvement to ensure optimal patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Several other studies and guidelines highlight best practices in transition care, emphasizing the need for structured, multidisciplinary approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, transition in IMDs is still a challenge because both adult metabolic physicians and adult metabolic centers are rare, and specific training in treating IMDs in adult patients is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">To collect data on the transition program in Italy from personnel who care for patients with IMDs, a survey was created and disseminated to Italian centers that take care of IMDs. The first aim of this survey was to assess the Italian experience with the transition of patients affected by IMDs from pediatric care to adult care. The second purpose was to assess how the transition for patients with IMDs is managed in Italy regarding the dietetic approach, including the perspective of dietitians, as to our knowledge, this is the first study to consider this aspect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par7">This was a descriptive cross-sectional observational study.

From a structural point of view, the survey was composed of two parts: the first part collected general data from the center; the second part was not fixed and provided a set of questions that were dependent on the subject completing it. This was done so that, whether the person answering was a dietitian or an MD, it was possible to delve more accurately into their specific point of view. In particular, the survey was addressed to all physicians involved in the management of these diseases, but not nurses, as the role of a dedicated nurse for these conditions has not yet been officially recognized in Italy. Moreover, physicians responded on the basis of their experience with all IMDs, whereas dietitians provided answers only regarding conditions that involve dietary management.</p><p id="Par13">Most of the questions had closed-ended answers.

This presents new challenges, as the management of adult patients affected by IMDs and possible complications is not always well defined by specific guidelines or evidence-based medicine but is often based on the experience of centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">The European Reference Network for Hereditary Metabolic Disorders (MetabERN) disseminated a survey on transition programs through 63 centers of MetabERN from 20 countries in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The main challenges identified were the lack of time and the shortage of MD experts in treating adults with IMDs. Conversely, the keys identified for a successful transition program include the presence of a transition coordinator, medical staff entirely dedicated to transition, and targeted training for physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].&#x000a0;An Italian group of clinicians treating PKU published an expert opinion on transition in patients with PKU, in 2022, hightlighting similar critical points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Comparing our findings with those from other countries, the study by Stepien et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] provides valuable insights into the challenges faced in the United States regarding the transition of IMD patients. The main barriers reported in the U.S include the lack of structured transition protocols, insufficient knowledge of IMDs among adult healthcare providers, and disparities in transition readiness due to social and legal differences. These challenges closely mirror those identified in Italy, particularly the limited number of specialized adult metabolic physicians and the absence of standardized transition programs. However, the U.S has seen some progress with the development of transition clinics, multidisciplinary transition teams, and readiness assessment tools such as the Ready Steady Go program. These initiatives aim to ensure a smoother transition process and might serve as a model for improving transition strategies in Italy. Future efforts in Italy should explore the feasibility of implementing similar structured programs to enhance the transition process and ensure better continuity of care.</p><p id="Par45">Although there is a National Coordination Center that has the task of supervision, currently, in Italy, each center is organized individually, without clear guidelines, and without the allocation of specific funds from the government. A total of 16 centers have managed to set up a transition path; 8 have a transition program regulated by an officially approved document in the hospital, which has been ongoing for a range varying between a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 15&#x000a0;years. Among the centers that do not have a transition program, 18 out of 19 expressed interest in establishing one, despite facing individual difficulties and challenges due to the absence of a standardized system. This lack of standardization creates many difficulties, both in creating centers specialized in care for adult patients with IMDs and in creating a structured transition program. Undoubtedly, this can discourage centers treating adult patients from even trying to start a path. A panel of Italian experts produced 8 practical guidelines to obtain an adequate transition program for PKU patients, which could be especially beneficial to centers that are yet to develop one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Even in the centers involved in the management of adult patients with IMDs, there is no homogeneity of care in terms of referred specialized MDs. This aspect underlines the importance of establishing a standardized and shared training path to offer patients the expected standardized quality of care. It is reasonable to assume that transitions may vary depending on the type of disease, given their differing care needs (e.g., risk of decompensation or not). However, addressing each disease group individually would have significantly complicated the study and made the survey more difficult to manage for each specific condition.</p><p id="Par47">One of the major challenges in improving transition programs is the education and training of adult healthcare providers on rare metabolic diseases. Currently, structured educational programs specific to IMDs in adults are limited in Italy, and there is no standardized national curriculum. Training opportunities are often dependent on individual institutions or international collaborations. The development of a dedicated training pathway for adult physicians specializing in IMDs is crucial to ensure continuity of care and proper disease management.</p><p id="Par48">The lack of homogeneity in MDs treating adult patients with IMDs, adversely affects the implementation of effective transition programs. In pediatric centers, this often determines referring patients to various specialists based on their predominant clinical manifestations, rather than to a physician who can serve as a central coordinator, engaging different specialists as needed based on the diverse clinical presentations of IMDs.</p><p id="Par49">Another critical aspect is the funding of transition programs. At present, there are no designated governmental funds allocated specifically for transition services in IMDs in Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Funding, when available, often comes from institutional hospital budgets, research grants, or patient advocacy groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Future efforts should aim to secure stable funding from national healthcare systems, European Union health programs, and philanthropic organizations to establish and sustain structured transition pathways. In Italy, Law 175/2021 assigns responsibility to reference centers for defining a personalized care pathway. This pathway includes the necessary treatments and monitoring for individuals affected by rare diseases, while also ensuring a structured transition from pediatric to adult care. However, practical implementation of this personalized care pathway is lacking.</p><p id="Par50">In 14 out of the 16 centers with a transition program, patients transition at 18, which is the age of consent in Italy. Reviewing the literature, an agreement about the ideal age to start transitioning is yet to be found. Despite the need to agree on age, transition in patients with IMDs should be considered a process rather than a passage, which should occur over an adequate period to give the patient and the family the chance to accommodate the new care setting. To make this process effective, patients (and their respective families) must be informed and made aware early on by the pediatric unit that, as adults, they will be transitioned to a specific center that can better suit the particular needs of their disease as they grow older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The number of joint visits combining both teams should be based on clinical needs and the organization of the centers (1&#x02013;10).</p><p id="Par51">The extreme variability of the transition paths in Italy is also reflected by the different compositions of the teams caring for adult patients. An MD, even with a different specialty, is always present; dietitians are not always present; dedicated nurses or psychologists are present in only half of the centers; and only 1 center reported having a dedicated biologist to organize and coordinate the transition process.</p><p id="Par52">Considering sociopsychological aspects, only one third of the centers declared routine evaluations of their patients before starting the transition. Unfortunately, the survey&#x000a0;did not delve further into the methods used, so we do not know how these centers evaluate these aspects. In 3 centers the degree of patient satisfaction with the transition process is routinely assessed; unfortunately, we do not have data related to the outcome of these evaluations, so at this time, we cannot comment on this matter. All the centers agreed that sharing clinical information for each transitioned patient between pediatric and adult centers efficiently and effectively was feasible, that the skills of the various MDs were recognized in this process, and that adult patients felt better in an environment tailored to their needs. Among the difficulties in maintaining follow-up for both pediatric and adult patients, the main concern that emerged was the lack of a doctor specialized in IMDs to treat adult patients. This again underlines the lack of standardization in the quality of care offered to patients. In addition, there is a lack of psychologists and a lack of space to create specialized clinics.</p><p id="Par53">Among the 19 centers that do not have a transition program, all but one would replicate the pediatric management model, creating an adult center that cares for all IMDs regardless of specific clinical manifestations. These centers identify the desirable age to start the transition at 18, agreeing on what emerged from the centers with a program. Notably, 10 out of 19 centers are already working to start a transition program soon; with these centers, those with a transition program will potentially outnumber those that do not.</p><p id="Par54">The high rate of adults lost to follow-up is another crucial element to be considered, among other reasons, to highlight the necessity of developing a transition program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In fact, out of the 19 centers, only 6 reported losing less than 10% of adult patients. Having a specialized center for adult patients with IMDs, with standardized procedures, personnel, infrastructure, and a program to transition patients from pediatric units to adult units, would promote adequate standardized quality of care, consequently promoting adherence to treatment and medical follow-up of adult patients. In reference to Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, it appears that in 6 out of 14 centers with a transition program, the same dietitian who follows pediatric patients with IMDs continues the follow-up for adult patients with IMDs as well. Considering 2 missing data points, 50% of these centers retain the same dietitian for both pediatric and adult patients with IMDs.</p><p id="Par55">On the other hand, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b shows that in centers without a transition program the majority of dietitians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] would assign the nutritional follow-up of adult patients with IMDs to a new dedicated dietitian, whereas only 2 dietitians would maintain nutritional follow-up with the same pediatric dietitian.</p><p id="Par56">As already highlighted, the presence of NBS and the increased life expectancy of patients with IMDs result in a larger number of adult patients in follow-up, leading to an increased workload and the need for specialized skills. This aspect is also relevant among the dietitians and physicians who participated in the survey. In fact, as shown in Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the lack of dedicated and trained dietitians for the treatment of adults with IMDs is identified as one of the main issues, both for those with an active transition program and for those without one.</p><p id="Par57">Another relevant aspect is that MDs and dietitians working in centers where there is no transition are concerned with the growing workload and the difficulties in managing typical adult conditions, such as pregnancy. Once again, the lack of standardization in Italy is a critical point in establishing a transition program, as the main difficulties that hinder standartization of adequate structure and personnel trained in IMDs.</p><p id="Par58">The strength of this study is the inclusion of all the main players in treating patients with IMDs, including dietitians and MDs for both pediatric and adult patients; the main aim is to provide, for the first time, an overview of the state of the transition programs in Italy, especially including centers that still do not have a program. Among the limitations of the study, the methodological one. Since this is a survey, the highest level of evidence is the participants' experience. Furthermore, not all doctors who deal with IMDs participated in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par59">This survey captures the state of the transition programs from pediatric to adult centers for patients by IMDs in Italy, allowing a comparison of the existing programs and the reported difficulties in implementing them. Different centers share the same pivotal needs and problems, such as identifying an MD for adult patients and the lack of infrastructure, in the context of the various heterogeneous experiences specific to different centers. This particular phenomenon of similar needs, despite different center experiences, is secondary to the lack of standardization, which leaves each center to address joint problems differently. The need for standardization emerges most strongly in the absence of formal qualifications of the personnel who should treat adult patients with IMDs and in the lack of a formal and precise procedure on how a transition program itself should be structured. The poor availability of dietitians dedicated to adult metabolic services should be addressed in the future to improve both the transition processes and quality of care, considering the fundamental role of this figure in the management of various IMDs; once again, this poor availability can be traced back to the lack of standardization. Treating IMDs is a challenge, as they constitute a heterogeneous family of a large number of diseases with various clinical repercussions; in addition, the number of identified, diagnosed, treatable diseases is steadily growing. Consequently, considering both the ever-growing number of patients and how they are aging, with the needs specific to IMDs and the typical clinical and psychological problems of adulthood, it is necessary to act on the recognition of "metabolic medicine" as a subspecialty, with a defined training program and defined competencies; this is a necessity yet to be adequately met, both in Italy and all over the world.</p><p id="Par60">Future efforts should focus on developing structured training programs for adult clinicians, fostering interest in IMDs, and securing funding for dedicated metabolic centers. Collaboration with national health policies, advocacy groups, and professional societies will be key in these efforts. Standardized guidelines should be developed by national and international metabolic disease organizations with input from multidisciplinary teams.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
