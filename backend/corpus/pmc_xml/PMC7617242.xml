In this study, we developed a preclinical experimental and analytical framework using patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTX) from patients with treatment-na&#x000ef;ve triple-negative breast cancers to test their predictive value in personalized cancer treatment approaches. Patients and their matched PDTXs exhibited concordant drug responses to neoadjuvant therapy using two trial designs and dosing schedules. This platform enabled analysis of nongenetic mechanisms involved in relapse dynamics. Treatment resulted in permanent phenotypic changes, with functional and therapeutic consequences. High-throughput drug screening methods in <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> PDTX cells revealed patient-specific drug response changes dependent on first-line therapy. This was validated <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, as exemplified by a change in olaparib sensitivity in tumors previously treated with clinically relevant cycles of standard-of-care chemotherapy. In summary, PDTXs provide a robust tool to test patient drug responses and therapeutic regimens and to model evolutionary trajectories. However, high intermodel variability and permanent nongenomic transcriptional changes constrain their use for personalized cancer therapy. This work highlights important considerations associated with preclinical drug response modeling and potential uses of the platform to identify efficacious and preferential sequential therapeutic regimens.</p><p>

In addition, we pioneered the use of dissociated PDTX cells) for high-throughput drug screening, with most drug responses validated <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. We developed a mass cytometry antibody panel tailored to breast cancer PDTXs, allowing highly resolved multiparametric single-cell phenotyping and its impact on drug responses (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>PDTX and PDTX cell drug response profiling offer exciting opportunities as anticipatory tools for personalized medicine. However, the extent to which PDTXs mirror therapy responses of the matched donor patient has been insufficiently studied. This is further complicated when patients receive multiple lines of therapy prior and subsequent to the development of the model. Indeed, although there is strong evidence that drug pressure (such as <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> treatment) impacts the phenotypic evolution of a PDTX tumor (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), its functional implications are rarely acknowledged in preclinical studies. Subsequent lines of clinical therapy could impede accurate drug response profiling when PDTXs are generated early in the disease trajectory. However, little evidence has been generated to directly test this, and in this study, we aimed to resolve this disparity. In addition, the heterogeneity observed between PDTX models, such as growth dynamics, urges a robust assessment of different <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> trial designs and analytical approaches to determine the impact on patient&#x02013;PDTX drug responses.</p><p>In this study, we developed a preclinical platform to robustly and systematically assess the concordance of patient&#x02013;PDTX drug responses using eight treatment-na&#x000ef;ve PDTX models and test efficacious treatment strategies for each patient.

Three tumors had genomic <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> alterations, including a homozygous copy-number loss (model 1006) and a pathogenic mutation (c.4327C&#x0003e;T, p.Arg1443Ter) with loss of heterozygosity (model 1040).</p><p>RNA-seq from four models (1006, 1040, 1022, and 1141) was used to interrogate the impact of spatial heterogeneity on PDTX expansion by analyzing distinct spatial regions of the same tumor, sister mice within a passage, and across multiple passages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S2). Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering of gene expression data revealed clear separations between models, and samples from the same model clustered together. GSEA was performed on each sample, and we observed a high correlation between enrichment scores of both HALLMARK and oncogenic signature gene sets, C6, across spatial regions, sister mice, and passages within each model. To further explore this at the mutational level, we performed WES on spatial regions, sister mice, and across passages for one model (1006). This demonstrated a high correlation of the variant allele frequencies (VAF) of mutations between all levels.</p><p>This supported previous findings that PDTXs and associated experimental procedures were suitable for <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> drug testing using sister mice as biological replicates and that the molecular features are stable across passages (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).

In design 1, to echo the PARTNER clinical trial regimen, treatment was administered 10 to 14 days after engraftment. In design 2, treatment commenced at a fixed TV (approximately 100 mm<sup>3</sup>) to account for model-specific growth dynamics; mice were assigned into cohorts using a stratified randomization approach, which aimed to evenly distribute initial TVs. For both trial designs, mice were administered with the same treatment as the matched patient (avatar mice), mirroring the patient treatment schedule and administration routes. In addition, the growth trajectory in the absence of treatment was monitored in five mice (untreated mice). Patients and PDTXs were treated with CT (carboplatin and paclitaxel) +/&#x02212; olaparib, referred to as CTO and CT trial arms, respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>A coclinical trial framework reveals concordant patient&#x02013;PDTX drug responses. <bold>A,</bold> Experimental framework (consisting of two trial designs) and associated analytical approach, with modeling metrics used to assess drug response. <bold>B</bold> and <bold>C,</bold> TV growth curves displaying linear mixed model fits of trial designs 1 (<bold>B</bold>) and 2 (<bold>C</bold>) over treatment duration.

The human dose of carboplatin (AUC5) was converted to 0.16 mg fixed dose for mice. The human paclitaxel dose of 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> was converted to 0.04 mg but, based on previous tolerability data on NSGs in our group, 0.07 mg was administered. The olaparib dose was converted from a 150 mg human dose to a 0.05 mg mouse dose. For design 2, drug doses were increased to 40, 7, and 50 mg/kg for carboplatin, paclitaxel, and olaparib, respectively, after performing tolerability experiments in NSG mice; approximate doses for a 20 g mouse were 0.8 mg carboplatin, 0.14 mg paclitaxel, and 1 mg olaparib.</p><p>For both trial designs and to mirror the clinical treatment schedule, carboplatin was administered once every 3 weeks by i.v. injection, paclitaxel was administered intravenously once weekly, and (when applicable) olaparib was administered by oral gavage on days 3 to 14 of each cycle. Four cycles of therapy were administered, with 3 weeks per cycle, totaling 11 weeks (77 days) of treatment. Although patients enrolled on the clinical trial received three subsequent cycles of anthracycline CT, this was omitted for the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> trial due to tolerability concerns for the mice.</p><p>Both trial designs were tested in six PDTX models spanning both clinical trial arms (CT and CTO), and trial design 2 was expanded to two further PDTX models. PDTX models were assigned into two response groups based on the matched patient&#x02019;s clinical response. pCR and non-pCR were used to classify patients, which is a strong predictor of clinical relapse (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The non-pCR patients used in this study had residual cancer burden (RCB) scores of RCB I or RCB II (Supplementary Table S4).</p><p>These data revealed high heterogeneity in growth rates between PDTX models, which was particularly pronounced using trial design 1 (Supplementary Fig. S3). This highlighted that the commencement of treatment at a fixed time point after implantation was not suitable for models with slower proliferation, e.g., 1008 and 1053. For these models, several untreated mice did not display measurable tumors after the treatment ended, and so drug responses could not be accurately assessed. In addition, for some models, we observed high variability between replicate mice in both untreated and treated cohorts; this was particularly noticeable for models 1040 and 1177. These data suggest that sample size should be adjusted for each PDTX model, guided by the untreated growth dynamics.</p><p>To account for this variability, we adopted mathematical modeling to assess the concordance with clinical drug responses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). We used the assumption of exponential tumor growth (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and fitted a single linear mixed-effects model for each unique PDTX model to estimate the drug response effect. The log-transformed TV was modeled as a function of time, treatment group, and their interaction. We included random intercepts and slopes for each mouse to model the variability in growth rates observed between replicates.</p><p>Four metrics were used to quantify the treatment effect: mean difference in daily growth rate; mean difference in the AUC; mean daily growth rate on treatment; and predicted TV at treatment end (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D&#x02013;F</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S4). The mean difference in daily growth rate and the AUC between the estimated marginal mean growth of the treated and untreated groups were used to assess whether treatment caused any improvement in the mice over untreated controls, even in instances in which the TV did not reduce. The mean daily growth rate for treated mice was used to identify whether treatment stopped tumor growth or induced tumor regression. The predicted volume at treatment end was the most similar metric to the pathologic assessment performed in the patient, measuring the total TV for each individual mouse at the end of treatment.</p><p>Using trial design 1, we observed marked differences in growth rate and the AUC between untreated and treated tumors for models 1022 and 1006, which were both derived from patients who achieved a clinical pCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). However, PDTX tumor growth was detected in all models. By contrast, using trial design 2, in which higher drug doses were administered, we observed improvements in treated mice compared with untreated controls in all models tested. However, tumor regression (indicated by negative growth rate under treatment) was observed only in models from patients who achieved pCR. Likewise, only models from these patients had a predicted TV close to zero at treatment end (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p><p>We used a Wilcoxon test to assess the statistical significance of each metric for the two trial designs. Trial design 2 produced statistically significant differences between pCR and non-pCR models using all four metrics (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), whereas trial design 1 did not. As described above, trial design 1 was not suitable for models with slower growth rates (e.g., 1053 and 1008), whereas trial design 2 (commencing treatment at fixed TVs) accounted for these model-specific growth dynamics. Although we observed high variability between biological replicates for model 1053, the modeling data from trial design 2 revealed that the change in growth rate, growth rate under treatment, and TV at treatment end were all lower than all PDTX models from which the matched patient had non-pCR. Likewise, the difference in the AUC was higher in 1053 than all PDTX models from non-pCR patients. This demonstrates the applicability of our platform to all models tested, including those with highly variable growth dynamics.</p><p>These data comprise the first systematic assessment of concordant drug responses in a neoadjuvant treatment-na&#x000ef;ve breast cancer setting using two experimental trial designs. Overall, we demonstrated an accurate recapitulation of clinical drug responses between matched patient&#x02013;PDTX in eight models by adopting mathematical modeling to capture biological variability. Analytical metrics that capture improvements compared with controls were suitable for trial design 1, whereas trial design 2 was most appropriately assessed using growth rate under treatment and TV at treatment end. Analogous to clinical response measurements, predicted TV at treatment end produced highly significant results for trial design 2 when comparing pCR and non-pCR response groups (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 1.241e&#x02212;6), and we therefore propose that this is the most appropriate trial design and response metric to compare PDTX drug responses with the clinical scenario.</p><p>These data exemplify the platform&#x02019;s utility in predicting patient drug responses, whilst concurrently highlighting crucial considerations for the design and implementation of preclinical trials, including intermodel heterogeneity and variability between replicate mice.

Using the same six PDTX models described in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, cohorts of replicate mice (five mice per arm) were subject to 11 weeks of treatment with the same clinical trial arm to the matched patient, the alternative clinical trial arm ,and other exploratory therapeutic strategies. Olaparib was tested in the absence of CT, and AZD1775 (a WEE1 inhibitor) was also included (both as a monotherapy and in combination with olaparib). Patients with TNBC commonly present with DNA damage response (DDR) pathway impairment, and so AZD1775 was selected as an example of an alternative DDR-targeted treatment.</p><p>We implemented trial design 1 to aid in scalability; treatment commenced for all models 10 to 14 days after implantation. After treatment withdrawal, PDTX tumors were allowed to progress to size limits to model tumor regrowth. This enabled exploration of both drug efficacy on treatment and relapse dynamics for every patient&#x02013;treatment pair. Replicate tumors were harvested at treatment end and at size limits for genomic and functional analyses.</p><p>We observed marked differences in drug efficacy and relapse dynamics in a patient- and treatment-specific manner (Supplementary Fig. S5). These data were analyzed using two different linear mixed models, during and following therapeutic pressure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B&#x02013;E</xref>; Supplementary Figs. S6&#x02013;S12), and response was reported using the same metrics as described above.</p><p>These results were particularly pronounced for models 1040, 1141, and 1022. For 1040, neither the patient nor the PDTX avatar responded to CT, whereas all alternative treatment strategies were successful at reducing growth rate during the treatment course (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S10). Once treatment ceased, all cohorts from model 1040 sustained a reduced growth rate compared with the untreated cohort, including CT, suggesting a prolonged drug effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). It should be noted that this in contrast to the other PDTX models tested, for which many treatment cohorts returned to comparable growth rates with untreated tumors upon drug withdrawal. We also observed striking differences in growth rate under treatment, TV at treatment end, and regrowth trajectories of model 1040 between treatment cohorts, exemplifying the platform&#x02019;s utility to compare drug efficacy on a patient-specific basis. Also of note, we observed dramatic interreplicate heterogeneity in regrowth dynamics in the olaparib and AZD1775 combination cohort, which is captured using our modeling approach.</p><p>Model 1141 was largely resistant to treatments <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> but responded to AZD1775 both as a monotherapy and in combination with olaparib (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S12). This was particularly evident by a change in growth rate and predicted volume at treatment end. However, upon drug withdrawal, the cohort treated with AZD1775 monotherapy returned to comparable rates to the untreated cohort, whereas the olaparib and AZD1775 combination cohort sustained a small reduction in growth rate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). In stark contrast, model 1022 was highly sensitive to all compounds tested, but once treatment ceased, growth returned to comparable rates with the untreated cohort.</p><p>These data support the potential use of the PDTX platform as a scalable tool to test the effects of alternative treatment strategies on each patient&#x02019;s tumor. However, it also illuminates two important findings. First, that testing on-treatment drug efficacy is insufficient to fully capture the long-term effects on a tumor. Second, first-line therapy can drastically alter the regrowth dynamics of a tumor, and these changes are patient-specific.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>PDTXs tumors undergo permanent nongenetic phenotypic evolution under therapeutic pressure</title><p>Having identified that the regrowth dynamics resulting from <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> treatment are both patient- and treatment-specific, we reasoned that this may have important consequences for the use of PDTXs as preclinical models both in personalized medicine for matched patients and in preclinical trials. The effect of previous treatments (either in the patient or PDTX) on a tumor&#x02019;s phenotype, evolution, and functional characteristics remains unexplored. Our platform provided the ideal setting to perform a detailed analysis of this question.</p><p>We chose to explore the genomic and phenotypic landscape of model 1006 when treated with the clinical trial compound, olaparib.

However, intriguingly, after drug withdrawal, these tumors exhibited rapid regrowth, suggesting that there is a reservoir of drug-tolerant cells that can resume proliferation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

PARP inhibitor resistance mechanisms rooted in genomics have been reported throughout the literature (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and we reasoned that intratumor heterogeneity could act as a substrate for clonal evolution, enabling cells to regrow following therapeutic pressure. However, multiregion WES failed to identify major genomic changes upon treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S14). We focused our analyses on nonsynonymous SNVs, frameshift indels, and stop-gain mutations and observed a high correlation between the VAFs detected in untreated, treated, and post-treated tumors. Hierarchical clustering of SNV VAFs revealed no clear separation between untreated, treated, and post-treated tumors. We then sought to identify &#x0201c;emergent&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;depleted&#x0201d; mutations. Emergent mutations were defined as those present in no untreated samples but in at least one treated or post-treated sample; conversely, depleted mutations were those present in two or more untreated mice but no treated or post-treated samples. Thieteen depleted mutations and thirty-three emergent mutations were detected. Although most were classified as predicted passenger mutations, we identified a depleted mutation in GATA2 and an emergent mutation in TRRAP, both predicted driver mutations (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). However, because these drivers were detected in just two untreated mice and one post-treated mouse, respectively, they was deemed insufficient to attribute the observed relapse to natural selection of a preexisting genetic clone via Darwinian evolution. This emphasized that genomic analysis alone may not capture important ongoing changes within a tumor&#x02019;s evolution.</p><p>Because genomic analysis failed to identify any mutations that could fully explain the survival of cells on treatment, we sought to explore the gene expression landscape. We analyzed untreated, treated, and post-treated tumors by bulk RNA-seq, which revealed minor yet significant changes in gene expression of known PARP inhibitor resistance markers related to DDR rewiring, including BRCA2, RAD51, and PALB2 (Supplementary Fig. S15A). This was despite an absence of mutations in these key DDR genes, further highlighting the importance of phenotypic (in addition to genomic) characterization.</p><p>Interestingly, when the same analysis was performed on model 1022, we observed a characteristic PARP inhibitor resistance mechanism. Model 1022 (transcriptomic BRCA1-null but no reported BRCA mutations) demonstrated a significant increase in BRCA1 expression in tumors treated with olaparib (Supplementary Fig. S15B and S15C). After treatment with olaparib, 5/5 mice demonstrated significantly higher gene expression, and indeed the most highly significant differentially expressed gene between untreated and post-treated tumors was <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> (logFC 9.06; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value 4.99 e&#x02212;06), indicating an epigenetic reversion of gene suppression. These data demonstrate that our platform enables the identification of known single biomarkers of resistance to PARP inhibitors. It also further supports the importance of phenotypic characterization of models, even in the absence of genomic alterations.</p><p>We then adopted an unbiased data-driven approach to explore the gene expression landscape of model 1006. Using the top 250 strong and variable genes identified in bulk RNA-seq, samples were clustered by Euclidean distance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Treated and post-treated tumors clustered together and separately from untreated tumors. To our surprise, this demonstrated a global transcriptomic shift upon treatment with olaparib that persisted after treatment was removed and &#x0223c;3 months of drug withdrawal. GSEA was performed between untreated and post-treated tumors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S16), which demonstrated a significant enrichment of the HALLMARK &#x0201c;epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)&#x0201d; gene set. Differentially expressed genes were then identified between untreated and post-treated tumors; post-treated tumors exhibited upregulation and downregulation of several mesenchymal and epithelial genes, respectively.

A total of 21,894 cells from eight samples (at least two biological replicates per condition) were available for analysis after applying quality control filters. MC analysis (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) revealed seven groups of MCs (cell states; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">F</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S17). Minor cell states expressed high levels of myoepithelial (e.g., TAGLN and ACTA2), hypoxic (CA9 and HILPDA), and immune activation (HLA-B and CD74) markers. The remaining MCs were classified into cell states based on expression of epithelial (e.g., KRT81, CLDN3, and SLPI) and mesenchymal markers (e.g., VIM, ITGA6, and EGFR). MCs were divided into epithelial, mesenchymal, and EM-hybrid states, and a subset of EM-hybrid MCs expressed high levels of immediate early response (IER) genes (e.g., FOS and JUNB), which we denoted as EM-hybrid-IER.</p><p>Most cells in untreated samples exhibited an epithelial phenotype, consistent with bulk RNA-seq and protein data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Immediately after treatment, there was a dramatic decrease in epithelial and increases in EM-hybrid and EM-hybrid-IER cells. After treatment withdrawal, high levels of EM-hybrid cells remained (but fewer with IER expression), and an increase was observed in mesenchymal cells. We also observed a small increase in epithelial cells, but this remained dramatically lower than in untreated controls.</p><p>These data revealed two key phenotypic changes induced by olaparib treatment, with both transient and permanent dynamics. In line with our previous data, olaparib caused phenotypic changes involving sequential transitions from an epithelial to an EM-hybrid cell state on treatment and to a fixed mesenchymal cell state in relapse samples. Although we did observe a small degree of reversion to an epithelial phenotype, the overwhelming majority of post-treated cells remained EM-hybrid or mesenchymal. In addition, this scRNA-seq analysis revealed that olaparib induced transient high expression of IER genes in cells residing in a stressed cell state. Crucially, these changes were highly consistent between both biological and technical replicates.</p><p>To further elucidate the drivers of this, we calculated three gene expression scores (epithelial, mesenchymal, and IER) by averaging gene enrichment of the top 50 genes correlated with KRT81, VIM, and JUNB, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S18; Supplementary Table S5). Using expression data from epithelial, EM-hybrid, and mesenchymal MCs, each score was correlated with the expression of known transcription factors (TF; ref. <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). As expected, TFs that correlated with the epithelial score were negatively correlated with the mesenchymal score, and vice versa. Several TFs known to be associated with epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes were indeed correlated with the respective scores, such as ELF5 (epithelial; ref. <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and TWIST2 (mesenchymal; ref. <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). A subset of TFs was found to be correlated with both mesenchymal and IER expression scores, including EMT master regulator SNAI2 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that the two key phenotypic changes observed in response to olaparib may be interrelated and that the transient overexpression of IER genes may drive, or be associated with, the permanent gene expression changes upon treatment.</p><p>Epithelial and mesenchymal scores were plotted for individual MCs, which (in line with several recent reports) demonstrated that EMT is a continuum rather than discrete cell states (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>; refs. <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Epithelial, mesenchymal, and EM-hybrid MCs were stratified into five groups (EMT1&#x02013;5). Mean gene enrichment of TFs across the EMT1 to EMT5 strata was used to infer TFs that may be driving different stages of the EMT trajectory (Supplementary Fig. S19A&#x02013;S19D). For some TFs, gene enrichment increased or decreased stepwise along the continuum, for example TWIST1 and ELF5, respectively. Others seemed early-acting, establishing a hybrid EM cell state, e.g., SNAI2 and ATF5. Conversely, other TFs were late-acting, transitioning cells from EM-hybrid to a fully mesenchymal phenotype, e.g., TWIST2 and IRX3. Adopting a similar approach for the IER trajectory (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>), EM-hybrid and EM-hybrid-IER MCs were stratified into four groups (IER1&#x02013;4). Again, mean gene enrichment of TFs was plotted across the IER1 to IER4 strata, which identified several TFs that correlated with acquisition of an IER phenotype, including TWIST1, SNAI2, and NFATC1 (Supplementary Fig. S19E and S19F). The observation that several TFs overlapped between the EMT and IER trajectories (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">K</xref>) supported our hypothesis that the transient and permanent phenotypic changes were interrelated. These data suggest that transcriptional programs associated with an IER trigger a cascade of phenotypic state dynamics, which occur independently or in parallel/interplaying with clonal evolution.</p><p>Overall, these data refine our understanding of tumor evolution in a setting that closely mimics the clinical scenario. These permanent changes driven by TF activity underscore a pivotal finding that even in the absence of new genomic alterations, there may be vast phenotypic changes affecting a tumor&#x02019;s structure and function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>

This included PARP inhibitors (olaparib and BMN-673) and drugs targeting ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, WEE1, and CHEK1/2. A range of other drug classes were also included, such as CTs (paclitaxel, carboplatin, and epirubicin), epigenetic modulators (JQ1), and mTOR-inhibitors (AZD8055).</p><p>We observed significant functional changes, some of which were specific to both the patient and the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> first-line treatment to which each tumor was exposed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Shifts in the AUC between untreated and post-treated tumors indicate changes in sensitivity to the specific compound tested <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo;</italic> an increase in the AUC denotes a gain in sensitivity. For example, olaparib treatment <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> decreased sensitivity of models 1040 and 1006 to several DDR agents (such as AZD6738, AZD7762, and AD1056), but the same pattern was not observed for models 1022 and 1141. It should also be noted that tumors were not always found to be less sensitive to the drug with which they were treated <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> as a first-line therapy, likely due to the short treatment duration and the months of drug withdrawal.</p><p>We next analyzed these data for patterns across models and drug classes. This experimental framework has potential utility to identify efficacious and preferential sequential treatment regimens. We observed that <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> treatment with CT increased response to the PARP inhibitors olaparib and BMN-673 for models 1040 and 1141 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). However, the converse was not true; treatment with olaparib did not significantly affect <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> response to carboplatin for these models and decreased response to paclitaxel for 1040, indicated by a decreased shift in the AUC.</p><p>To validate these findings, we performed a preclinical trial in which we tested alternative drug sequencing strategies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Post-treated tumors collected from model 1040 after first-line <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> treatment with either CT or ilaparib were each reimplanted into a cohort of 15 to 18 NSG mice. As controls, untreated tumors from 1040 were also reimplanted into 15 to 18 mice. When tumors reached &#x0223c;200 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice from each group were randomized into three trial arms and treated with no drug (untreated), CT, or olaparib (Supplementary Fig. S20A).</p><p>We observed high variability between mice within each cohort (Supplementary Fig. S20B and S20C), further exposing the crucial importance of both sample size and our linear mixed model approach, which captures this variability between mice. We used the same analytical approach as described previously and reported four modeling metrics to describe the drug responses of each previous treatment group (first line) to each subsequent treatment [(second line) <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E&#x02013;G</xref>; Supplementary Fig S20D and S20E]. In line with our previous findings for model 1040, we observed low response to CT but good response to olaparib in tumors that were previously untreated. We also observed low response to CT in the groups previously treated with either CT or olaparib. However, strikingly, we observed an enhanced response to olaparib in tumors that had previously been treated with CT compared with olaparib as a first-line therapy. This finding was substantiated by the mathematical modeling metrics: this sequence of treatment (CT followed by olaparib) was the only scenario in which growth rate under treatment was reduced to 0 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>), and it produced the lowest predicted volume at treatment end than any other cohort (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). This validates our <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> drug responses and suggests that <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> treatment with CT affects the subsequent response to olaparib for this PDTX model.</p><p>These data emphasize the value of combining <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> drug screening to study PDTX drug responses and show that <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> drug response changes are recapitulated <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. This illuminates a previously unrecognized utility of PDTX experimental frameworks to identify efficacious sequential treatment strategies and to study the evolutionary, phenotypic, and functional consequences of treatment on the tumor.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>PDTX models are excellent experimental tools to study human disease at high resolution, and the use of PDTX models in preclinical studies is widespread. Their utility ranges from molecular characterization of disease to identification of drug resistance mechanisms. Within drug development, PDTXs are exploited to screen experimental compounds, from early drug development to preclinical studies adopting 1 &#x000d7; 1 &#x000d7; 1 trial designs, in which cohorts of PDTXs mimic clinical trials (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). More recently, PDTXs are gaining traction as predictive tools in personalized medicine.</p><p>We have built on our previously published findings to develop a coclinical trial experimental and analytical framework, anchored alongside a prospective clinical trial for patients with TNBC. We demonstrated that PDTX models accurately recapitulate clinical drug responses on a matched patient&#x02013;PDTX basis. We also showed that <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> treatment causes permanent phenotypic changes to the tumor, which is driven by TF activation, but is overlooked when using genomic analyzes alone. Furthermore, <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> treatment has long-term functional implications for the tumor, including changing the drug response profile for next-line therapies.</p><p>Although we are not the first to report concordant patient&#x02013;PDTX drug responses in breast cancer (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), our data highlight several important findings for the use of PDTX models in preclinical and clinical medicine. Our data display heterogeneity in growth rates of PDTX models both between models and (for some) between replicate mice. It is therefore imperative to consider the trial design, number of replicates, and analyses for each individual model. In this study, we present data using two trial designs, each of which had unique benefits and suitability for different PDTX growth dynamics and experimental requirements. To account for intermouse differences, we adopted mixed linear modeling that captures this biological variability and reported the findings using four metrics. We propose this analytical framework as an appropriate and necessary approach to analyze such data. However, our findings strongly oppose the use of 1 &#x000d7; 1 &#x000d7; 1 trial designs for some PDTX models, and careful consideration is crucial before adopting such methods.</p><p>We argue that our experimental approach has potential to accelerate both drug development studies and precision medicine. Whereas clinical trials require comparison to standard-of-care treatments, we have developed a framework that allows direct comparison of any given treatment to a true negative control (untreated) and that is scalable to test alternative treatments, schedules, and combinations in parallel. Crucially, this platform could have uses in the curative setting, in which it is notoriously difficult to test new drugs but has potential for strong clinical benefit.</p><p>We demonstrated that a tumor&#x02019;s phenotype is permanently altered by short-term <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> treatment even in the absence of genomic changes. This highlights that it is essential to evaluate the phenotypic concordance of matched patient&#x02013;PDTX tumors, in additional to genomic analysis, to ensure the molecular and functional features are retained during PDTX establishment and propagation. In parallel, we observed that <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> treatment had functional implications on a given tumor and that these effects are treatment specific. This suggests that the clinical history of a tumor may impact the accuracy of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> drug response profiling. All primary tumors used to derive PDTXs in this study were treatment-na&#x000ef;ve, but this pivotal finding indicates that PDTX models may require parallel treatments to the matched patient to retain accurate predictive value. Further work utilizing longitudinal clinical samples is essential to resolve this.</p><p>The data described here illuminate a previously unrecognized utility of PDTXs to study efficacious sequential and combination therapeutic strategies. Our experimental framework can be used to test alternative drug sequencing to identify best practices for both treatment efficacy and within the context of long-term tumor evolution. We also demonstrate that therapies with similar on-treatment effects can cause marked differences in a tumor&#x02019;s regrowth dynamics, justifying the use of PDTXs to study evolution.</p><p>Our data also alluded to a novel drug response mechanism to olaparib. This is akin to previous reports of phenotypic switching in response to treatment (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>; bioRxiv 2023.12.07.570359). A striking observation was the permanent nature of the phenotypic change, contrasting with mechanisms such as drug-tolerant persister cells (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) but more in line with stable nongenetic drug resistance (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Our scRNA-seq data suggest that upon treatment, cells adopt an EM-hybrid cell state enriched for IER genes, but upon drug withdrawal, cells continue to progress toward a fully transitioned, stable mesenchymal phenotype. Previous reports have demonstrated that EM-hybrid cells exhibit higher metastatic potential (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) and tumorigenicity (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) than their epithelial or mesenchymal counterparts. Our data leads to the compelling hypothesis that drug withdrawal may drive cells further toward a mesenchymal cell state, which, although traditionally associated with a more aggressive phenotype than epithelial cells, has less metastatic potential and tumorigenicity than hybrid cells that emerge on treatment. Using the scRNA-seq data to derive EMT and IER trajectories, we identified that overlapping TFs (including EMT master regulator SNAI2) may be implicated in directing cell state transitions, highlighting the potential to identify plasticity-driver vulnerabilities (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Crucially, we have also shown that phenotypic adaptation has functional implications that could impact responses to next-line therapies.</p><p>We acknowledge several limitations of our study. Patients in the clinical trial received neoadjuvant anthracycline therapy following the clinical trial compounds, which was omitted from the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> trial due to tolerability concerns. Whereas this could limit the accuracy of the matched patient-PDTX drug response data, our findings revealed striking concordance. We argue that this work provides a strong foundation and preliminary experimental framework to expand into larger patient cohorts and wider ranges of clinical compounds and clinical scenarios. In addition, the use of both PARP and WEE1 inhibitors used in this study are not currently in standard-of-care clinical practice. Although this limits the direct implementation of our findings, we again argue that the platform provides a foundation to expand into other drug treatments and patient cohorts. Ultimately, a clinical trial with an avatar arm is needed to consolidate the use of these data to benefit patients with cancer.</p><p>Second, NSG mice used in our study are severely immunocompromised. Although this was necessary for the propagation of PDTX models, we acknowledge the significant role of the immune system (and more broadly the tumor microenvironment) in drug responses and tumor evolution, particularly considering recent advances in the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Despite this, we observed strong concordance to patient drug responses, and further experiments are required to delineate the impact of the remaining mouse and human immune compartments on PDTX growth, response to treatment, and relapse dynamics. As such, we propose that our platform could provide a useful setting to test a range of drug treatments (including targeted agents) but limited to those not requiring immune modulation.</p><p>In addition, we recognize the low engraftment rate (&#x0223c;33% of all implanted). Although this is in line with that previously published by us (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and others (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), it presents a possible caveat that we are selecting a subpopulation of patients with more aggressive tumors. We acknowledge that we are unable to comment on the behaviors and patient&#x02013;PDTX concordance of the unengrafted PDTX population, and this remains unexplored. Indeed, this highlights another important consideration when using PDTXs for personalized medicine; low engraftment rates restrict the use of PDTXs for clinical practice and we are, to date, limited in our ability to predict which tumors will successfully engraft.</p><p>In this study, we present a robust and systematic assessment of PDTX models as preclinical tools. We have developed a novel experimental and analytical framework to test patient&#x02013;PDTX drug response concordance, assess drug efficacy, and explore the impact of alternative treatments on long-term evolutionary trajectories of human breast cancer. In doing so, we have illuminated new opportunities and considerations for the use of PDTXs in both preclinical and clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary Figures 1-20</label><caption><p>Supplementary Figures 1-20</p></caption><media xlink:href="can-24-1703_supplementary_figures_1-20_suppsf1-20.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary Tables 1-5</label><caption><p>Supplementary Tables 1-5</p></caption><media xlink:href="can-24-1703_supplementary_tables_1-5_suppst1-5.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary Legends</label><caption><p>Supplementary Figures 1-20 and Supplementary Tables 1-10 Legends</p></caption><media xlink:href="can-24-1703_supplementary_legends_suppsd.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by funding from Cancer Research UK (CRUK; Caldas Core Grant A16942 and CRUK Cambridge Institute Core Grant A29580) and an ERC Advanced Grant to C.
