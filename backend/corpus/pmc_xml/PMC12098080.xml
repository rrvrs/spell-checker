The study was conducted from May 5 to May 20, 2023. The quantitative data were collected by using a semi-structured interview-administered questionnaire and chart review. Logistic regression was employed, and a p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Qualitative data were collected by in-depth interviews, and audio recordings were first transcribed verbatim and then translated to the English language by the first author and analyzed manually using a thematic approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Result</title><p>Out of the total 600 type 2 diabetic patients, 262 (43.7%) with 95% CI: 40&#x02013;47.8% of the study participants had good adherence to diabetes self-care practices. The multivariable analysis indicated that type 2 diabetic patients who lived in urban areas [AOR: 5.4, 95% CI: (1.05-8.7)] were 5.4 times more likely to have good diabetic self-care practice than those rural residents. Those who had a high school level of education [AOR: 2.9, 95% CI: (1.3-6.6)] were 2.9 times more likely to have good self-care practice, and those with college and above [AOR: 5, 95% CI (2&#x02013;12):] were five times more likely to have good self-care practice. Regarding occupation, unemployed people were 66% less likely to have good self-care practices than employed people. Those who had no availability of healthcare services [AOR: 0.19, 95% CI: (0.09-0.37)] were less likely by 81% to have good self-care practice than those who had availability of healthcare services. These are significantly associated with diabetic self-care practice. The qualitative component clarified six themes: lack of education and awareness, financial affordability, accessibility, lack of family support, and having diabetic-related complications were identified as barriers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study indicated that adherence of patients with type 2 diabetes to the recommended self-care practices was considerably poor. Different factors included the respondents who had a high school level or higher level of education and those who lived in urban areas. This was supported by the results from the qualitative part and thus the endorsement to strengthen diabetes health education to patients and their families. So, diabetic patients require an integrated approach through treatment as well as health education, which will increase the health and well-being of the patient.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>type 2 diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>adherence to diabetes self-care practice</kwd><kwd>factors</kwd><kwd>North Shewa Zone</kwd><kwd>Ethiopia</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="29"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="6966"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>section-in-acceptance</meta-name><meta-value>Diabetes Self-Management</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>According to estimations from the World Health Organization (WHO), type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the third-highest risk factor for early mortality globally, behind only high blood pressure and cigarette use. Furthermore, considerable epidemiologic research demonstrates that T2DM incidence is rising globally. It affects 463 million people and is expected to affect 629 million people by the year 2045, making up around 90% of all diabetic patients (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Effective management of T2D requires individuals to adhere to a comprehensive self-care regimen, which includes lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes, regular physical activity, blood glucose monitoring, medication adherence, and routine medical checkups.</p><p>A metabolic condition with numerous etiologies, diabetes mellitus (DM) is defined by an elevated blood glucose level and abnormalities in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins as a result of problems in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Insulin resistance is a metabolic disorder known as type 2 diabetes that is characterized by a progressive loss of adequate cell insulin production and a rise in blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Poor eating habits and physical inactivity are the two main modifiable risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes (DM2) in addition to genetic predisposition (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), which accounts for 90% to 95% of all instances of the illness. The increased prevalence of type 2 DM worldwide was influenced by changes in lifestyle and an increase in obesity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). It is a terrible, widespread chronic condition that frequently results in limb amputations, blindness, renal failure, and stroke (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), increasing the efficacy of self-management support may have a more significant impact on population health than medical therapies. The term &#x0201c;self-management&#x0201d; refers to the alterations in lifestyle required to manage a chronic illness (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>The study conducted in Debre Markos showed that the majority of respondents, 221 (92.5%), were trying to manage their diet, and only 32.9% of them were trying weight reduction (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Self-care is an activities that people take on their own initiative to maintain their own health, happiness, and quality of life. Additionally, it is crucial and absolutely necessary in the overall control of diabetes and is frequently regarded as the cornerstone of diabetic care (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Diabetes self-care practices are critical in keeping the disease under control, and as much as 95% of the self-care is usually provided by the patients or their families (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Self-management refers to the individual&#x02019;s capacity to manage the symptoms, treatment, physical and psychosocial significances, and lifestyle changes characteristic of living with a chronic condition (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Adhering to diabetic self-care management involves changing one&#x02019;s lifestyle and may involve taking medication, recommended diet, regular physical activity, foot care practice, and self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Adherence is a potent, complex process with many interrelated components. Factors relating to psychology, and demographics, and society have been linked to diabetes patients&#x02019; adherence. Commitment to these self-care practices enhances blood sugar regulation, maintains blood pressure, lessens the severity of problems, and lowers medical expenses (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>There are various types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder where the body&#x02019;s immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This results in little to no insulin production. It is most commonly diagnosed in children, adolescents, or young adults. People with type 1 diabetes are insulin-dependent for life because their bodies cannot produce insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the body either becomes resistant to insulin or does not produce enough insulin. The exact cause is unclear but is often linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet. Typically develops in adults (over 40 years old), but increasing numbers of children and adolescents are being diagnosed due to rising obesity rates. Insulin is not always required initially, but many people with type 2 DM may eventually need insulin or other medications to control blood glucose.</p><p>The significance of self-management compliance in preventing type 2 diabetes complications following self-management guidelines is essential to avoiding type 2 diabetes (T2D) problems. T2D is a chronic illness that can cause blindness, kidney failure, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, and other long-term health issues if left untreated.</p><p>Self-management is crucial for regulating blood glucose levels and reducing the risk of these complications because the disease is chronic. This includes keeping an eye on blood glucose levels, taking medications as directed, eating a healthy diet, exercising frequently, and managing stress. The roles of adherence to self-management in preventing complication are also prevention of long-term complications, control of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, management of comorbidities, prevention of cute complications, psychological benefits, and overall quality of life.</p><p>The current study can utilize study populations from different health institutions and have better generalizability. Therefore, the finding of this study would be important for the health professionals, zonal health department, regional and federal ministry of health, and policymakers to emphasize adherence to diabetic self-care management and associated factors among diabetic patients.</p><p>Health practitioners can identify as high-risk for disease-related complications early and take prompt action to improve their outcomes by giving education, emphasizing the management of diabetes. Helping patients improve their health and quality of life is considered an important aspect of diabetes self-care for patients and their relatives. Therefore, the findings of the current study will be helpful to design adherence to diabetic self-care practice and to explore different barriers of self-care practice, and also it helps every staff member in the diabetic clinic to improve the health information about self-care practice.</p><p>A study in a Gamo Gofa Zone public hospital found that participants who lived in the rural areas were seven times more likely to have poor diabetic self-care than their counterpart (AOR: 7.16; 95% CI 3.31&#x02013;15.46) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A cross-sectional study done in Debre Markos University found that the study participants who were rural residents were 29% (AOR: 0.71, 95% CI 0.40&#x02013;2.23) less likely to practice self-care habits than those urban residents (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Study design, setting, and period</title><p>This study employed a concurrent mixed-methods approach in order to offer a more comprehensive understanding of a research problem and was conducted in the North Shewa Zone public hospitals in Ethiopia. For both quantitative and qualitative studies, the data collection was held from May 5 to May 20, 2023. The methods of integration of quantitative and qualitative study were as follows: Sequential integration involves using one method first and then using the other method. The North Shewa Zone is one of the 12 zones found in the Amhara regional state. Its city administration is Debre Berhan, which is located 130 km from Addis Ababa and 695 km from Bahir Dar, the capital city of the Amhara regional state. The total population of the zone is 2,322,148, out of which 1,171,150 are men and 1,150,638 are women. The zone is bordered at the south and the west by the Oromia special zone on the northeast and the Afar region on the east. According to the zonal health department report, the North Shewa Zone has 164 private clinics, 97 governmental health centers, 391 health posts, 8 primary hospitals, 2 general hospitals, and 1 comprehensive specialized hospital. North Shewa Zone has a total of 11 public hospitals (56).</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Study population and inclusion criteria</title><p>All type 2 diabetic patients who got services in North Shewa Zone public hospitals were considered as the source population for both quantitative and qualitative study designs. Included were those in this study whose age was greater than 18 years and who had follow-ups for at least 6 months. Clients who could not communicate due to illness and pregnant women were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>Sample size determination</title><p>The sample size required for the study was calculated using Open Epi statistical software, version 3.03. A 95% confidence interval (CI), a 5% margin of error, and a 44.7% prevalence of adherence to diabetic self-care management were the assumptions made. Adding a 10% non-response rate, the estimated sample size was 417 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). By using a design effect of 1.5, the total sample size becomes 626.</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><title>Sampling procedure</title><p>A simple random sampling technique was used for the selection of hospitals after identifying all public hospitals in the North Shewa Zone. Debere Berhan Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (DBCSH), Mehal Meda General Hospital (MMGH), Deneba Primary Hospital (DPH), and Shewarobit Hospital (SPH) were selected randomly, and then a sample was drawn from each hospital based on primary data from type 2 DM patients who came for follow-up, and their medical record number (MRN) was used as a sampling frame. The total number of T2DM in selected hospitals was 1420 (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure 1</bold>
</xref>). The sample has been allocated proportionally for each hospital. Study participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. First, the sampling interval (K) value was determined by dividing the total number of type 2 diabetic patients in the study period by the total sample size, which gives 2. The first participant was chosen by the lottery method, and the rest were chosen at every two intervals until the desired sample size was reached. The number of participants for the qualitative interview was selected by using purposive sampling to select 15 type 2 DM patients from four public hospitals in their specialized diabetic clinic. Participants were selected based on their duration of diabetes monthly follow-up for more than 5 years. From Debre Berhan Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Deneba Primary Hospital, Mehalmeda General Hospital, and Shewarobit Primary Hospital, participation was using in-depth interviews till the patterns or themes in the data became repetitive and no new information was being revealed through further data collection; the data were theoretically saturated.</p><fig position="float" id="f1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Adherence to diabetic self-care management and it's associated factors among type 2 diabetic patients in North shewa zone public hospitals, Ethiopia 2023.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fcdhc-06-1560907-g001" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2_5"><title>Data collection tool and procedure</title><p>Data were collected by using a semi-structured interview-administered questionnaire, which contained five subparts. Part one is sociodemographic factors, which included five questions. Six questions made up the tool&#x02019;s second section, &#x0201c;Health care facility related factors,&#x0201d; and three questions made up its third section, &#x0201c;Disease-related factors&#x0201d;. The fourth section included two questions and treatment-related parameters. The last one was the outcome variable. Adherence to diabetic self-care activities consisted of five domains, namely, adherence of diet, physical activities, blood sugar testing, foot care, and antidiabetic medication. Each domain has four, two, two, four, and three questions, respectively. Within qualitative tools, age and sex are included in sociodemographic questions for type 2 DM patients, and they also ask about period of diagnosis. Four barriers of adherence to diabetic self-care practice questions were included in the qualitative part. If the data were collected anonymously, confidentiality and beneficence would be assured throughout the study period.</p><p>The study participants for both the quantitative and qualitative parts were notified orally and signed an informed consent and were then selected using systematic sampling at every other patient. The first respondent was chosen by lottery from the first two patients to the hospital. A purposive sampling procedure was used to recruit type 2 DM patients for the study based on their sex, age, and the period of their diagnosis (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This was done to be able to see the different methods of self-care practices from different perceptions.</p><p>All in-depth interviews were conducted by the first author in a private space within the hospital compound. The interview was conducted in the Amharic language and tape-recorded with verbal consent obtained from the study participants, and then translated into English. The required data were collected by four BSc nurses. Training was provided for data collectors similar to that of the&#x000a0;quantitative part. We used different strategies to mitigate interview and social desirability bias, as follows: standardize interviews, train interviews, minimize non-verbal cues, ensure confidentiality, ensure anonymity, create a comfortable environment, and use indirect questions.</p></sec><sec id="s2_6"><title>Study variable</title><p>The dependent variable of the study is adherence to self-care. Sociodemographic variables (sex, age, marital status, level of education, occupation/employment), healthcare facility-related factors (access to healthcare facilities, patient satisfaction with quality healthcare services, physician patient relationship, and communication of critical information), disease-related factors (duration of type 2 DM, comorbidity, illness-associated complication), and treatment-related factors (route of administration, duration of treatment) are among the explanatory variables that can be used to explain the data.</p></sec><sec id="s2_7"><title>Definition of terms</title><sec id="s2_7_1"><title>Adherence to diabetic self-care management</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x02714; Adherence: the extent to which a person&#x02019;s behavior concerning taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health provider (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02714; Self-care: activities that individuals initiate and perform on their behalf in maintaining life, health, and well-being (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02714; Self-care practice: It is a daily regimen task that the individual patients were to perform to manage diabetes on their behalf (dietary practice, exercise, medication, daily foot care, and monitoring blood glucose) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02714; Diabetes self-care practice was assessed by participants&#x02019; responses to the 14-item Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) in the last 7 days.

Of the study participants, 50.3% had good self-care practices.</p><p>This variation could be due to sociocultural differences, different study periods, and a study area that means that the North Shewa Zone is a very wide area and the population lives in rural areas more scattered than other cities; it might be a reason for health service utilization, the educational status of the respondent, and the current economic crisis, which can be some of the major justifications for the lower result of good adherence to diabetic self-care practice.</p><p>This study revealed that those who lived in urban areas were 5.4 times more likely to have good diabetic self-care practice than those rural residents. This is consistent with a study conducted in Debre Markos (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and Gamo Gofa Zone public hospital (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, the respondents who had a high school level were 2.9 times more likely to be engaged in good self-care practice, and those who had college and above were five times more likely to have good self-care practice when compared with respondents who had no formal education. This finding was congruent with the studies conducted in Dire Dawa (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), Addis Ababa (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and Ghana (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This indicates that education is the base for a diabetic patient to understand the disease process and to provide their own self-care practice because they may be able to read and become well-informed of the benefits of adherence.</p><p>Based on the study, unemployed people were less likely by 66% to have good self-care practices than employed people; this finding was in line with the study conducted in Addis Abeba (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) in Debre Markos (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and the study conducted in Tigray region, Ethiopia (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Respondents who had no availability of healthcare services at any time were 81% less likely to adhere to diabetic self-care practices than those who had availability of healthcare services at any time. This finding was congruent with a study conducted in a Kenya referral hospital (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>A complete self-care practice among type 2 diabetic patients was uncommon. Most of the respondents entirely depended on their medications, feeding habits, and measuring blood glucose levels to manage their illnesses and its complications and tended to undermine the importance of the other elements of self-care either due to lack of education, financial affordability, limited awareness, and negligence toward adherence to diabetic self-care practice, accessibility, or lack of social support.</p><p>In this study, financial affordability was the major barrier to good adherence to diabetic self-care practice elements. This finding was in line with the study conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Similarly, the study done in Tigray, Ethiopia, indicated that the too restrictive nature of diet recommendations and financial problems had a negative influence on their adherence to self-care behaviors (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>The findings from the study revealed that the majority of the respondents had a lack of education, limited awareness, and negligence toward adherence to diabetic self-care practices; some of the negligent respondents had gotten access, but they should not give attention to themselves toward self-care practices. This finding was congruent with the studies conducted in Addis Ababa, which revealed that some of the participants also reported that adhering strictly to diabetes dietary recommendations is boring and practically impossible (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and that education from physicians is one of the most important determinants for change in self-care practices (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, this study explored patient compliance; the respondents feel hopelessness due to the disease being incurable, and they preferred alcohol to the recommended drug, and some of them faced loss of social support. This finding is in line with the study conducted in Ghana. Most patients reported that these family members assisted with a wide range of management strategies, such as adjusting to new diet regimes and roles dictated by the patient and assisting with the preparation of recommended diet (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). A similar study in Pakistan found that getting support from family members is one of the important determinants of compliance with medication-taking behavior (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>In case of diabetic-related complications, these study participants were disturbed to perform daily activities, unable to do their business, and faced an economic crisis. This finding was in line with the study conducted in Dessie Referral Hospital that low-risk perception of complications among DM patients may make them reluctant to practice recommended self-care (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A study conducted in Singapore showed that participants expressed an awareness of risking diabetes-related complications due to poorly controlled diabetes (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Self-care practices are determined based on the respondents&#x02019; self-reported values; performance of these activities was not observed and could not be confirmed. Interviewer bias and social participants may provide socially desirable answers about their adherence to self-care management, especially when discussing sensitive topics such as medication adherence or diet, which can skew the results, which were another limitation for this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusion and recommendation</title><p>This study indicated that adherence of patients with type 2 diabetes to the recommended self-care practices was considerably poor. Different factors, including the respondents who have a high school level or higher levels of education, people with type 2 diabetes who lived in urban areas, the respondents who were unemployed, and people with type 2 diabetes who had no availability of healthcare services at any time, had statistically significant associations with adherence to diabetic self-care practice according to the quantitative study. The findings suggest that sociodemographic factors such as age, education level, and economic status play a significant role in influencing self-care behaviors. Older patients, those with higher education levels, and those with better financial stability tend to show better adherence to prescribed self-care routines, including medication and diet. On the other hand, patients from lower socioeconomic backgrounds face challenges in accessing medication, attending regular medical appointments, and acquiring the necessary resources for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This was supported by the results from the qualitative part and thus the endorsement to strengthen diabetes health education to patients and their relatives.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x02714; We recommend that policymakers should have to develop health information dissemination programs and strategies to improve the awareness of diabetic patients about the importance of diabetic self-care practices.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02714; Regional Health Bureau and Zonal Health Department with North Shewa Zone public hospitals diabetic clinic coordinators should give greater emphasis toward accessibility of nearby health facilities around the rural area as much as possible.
