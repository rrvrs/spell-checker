This gap in knowledge is significant, as limb IRI can lead to severe outcomes, including prolonged recovery, chronic dysfunction, or amputation, underscoring the urgent need for effective prevention and treatment strategies. The pathological mechanisms of limb IRI share notable similarities with those observed in cardiac IRI, particularly the involvement of oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and immune cell infiltration (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). During ischemia, oxygen deprivation disrupts cellular metabolism, while reperfusion triggers a surge of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory mediators, amplifying tissue injury through apoptosis, necrosis, and endothelial dysfunction (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Studies suggest that immune cell infiltration, notably of neutrophils and macrophages, plays a pivotal role in driving inflammation and exacerbating damage in both limb and cardiac IRI (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, the scarcity of comprehensive patient-derived data for limb IRI poses a significant challenge, limiting insights into its molecular underpinnings and hindering the development of targeted therapies.</p><p>Given these challenges, a cross-tissue analysis leveraging well-characterized cardiac IRI data offers a promising avenue to advance limb IRI research. The mechanistic overlap between limb and cardiac IRI&#x02014;particularly in immune-mediated pathways&#x02014;suggests that insights from cardiac studies could illuminate limb-specific processes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Yet, current research often focuses narrowly on single organs, overlooking potential shared therapeutic targets across tissues. Traditional experimental approaches also struggle to capture the complexity of IRI&#x02019;s multi-pathway nature, necessitating innovative strategies to integrate diverse biological data and identify key regulatory genes.</p><p>To address these limitations, this study employs model network analysis, a computational approach that integrates gene expression profiles, protein interaction networks, and signaling pathway data to construct comprehensive biological models (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Widely applied in biomedical research, this method excels at uncovering disease-related gene interactions and predicting therapeutic targets (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). By combining cardiac and limb IRI datasets, we aim to bridge the data gap in limb IRI research and reveal shared and unique molecular drivers. Our approach not only compensates for the paucity of limb-specific data but also pioneers a cross-tissue perspective that could redefine IRI management.</p><p>The specific objectives of this study are: (1) to develop a cross-tissue biological network model of IRI by integrating cardiac and limb gene expression data, protein interactions, and immune-related signaling pathways; (2) to identify key genes and pathways common to limb and cardiac IRI, emphasizing immune infiltration regulators, using network analysis; (3) to validate the functional roles of these genes in limb IRI through <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse models, assessing their therapeutic potential; and (4) to quantify the contribution of immune cell infiltration to limb IRI progression and its correlation with identified gene targets. By harnessing a cross-tissue bioinformatics strategy, this study seeks to uncover novel molecular insights and therapeutic avenues, offering a significant step forward in understanding and mitigating limb IRI, the whole technical flow chart of this study displayed in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">

An exhaustive Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>) search for limb IRI datasets (criteria: RNA-seq or microarray, n &#x02265; 10, paired control/treatment groups) yielded no suitable candidates. Consequently, we selected GSE36073, which profiles CTGF-stimulated adult cardiac myocytes, based on its high data quality (n = 12 samples), adequate sample size, and mechanistic overlap with limb IRI, including inflammatory responses and immune cell infiltration (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The GSE36073 dataset comprised 12 samples of primary adult mouse cardiac myocytes cultured under two conditions: 6 samples untreated (control group; GSM880719&#x02013;GSM880723, GSM880729) and 6 samples stimulated with 200 nmol/L recombinant CTGF for 48 hours (model group; GSM880724&#x02013;GSM880728, GSM880730). These samples, derived from C57BL/6 mice, were profiled using the Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip (GPL6887 platform) to investigate CTGF-induced transcriptional changes linked to IRI-related cardiac protection.

The Gini coefficient method was used to rank the importance scores of the genes, and a random forest plot and gene importance plot were generated. The top 19 genes ranked by importance from the random forest analysis were selected. Next, the Lasso regression algorithm was used for cross-validation and key gene selection among the DEGs. The &#x0201c;venn&#x0201d; package in R was used to perform a Venn analysis, and the intersection of the gene sets obtained from the Lasso regression and the top 19 genes from the random forest algorithm was identified as the key genes for IRI.</p></sec><sec id="s2_5"><label>2.5</label><title>Animal validation design and key gene verification</title><sec id="s2_5_1"><label>2.5.1</label><title>Animal experiment design</title><p>Six healthy male SPF rats, aged 2 months and weighing (225 &#x000b1; 25) g, were provided by the Henan Experimental Animal Center (Production license No.: SCXK(Yu)2022-0001).

The experimental procedures strictly followed national or institutional regulations on the management and use of laboratory animals. The six rats were randomly divided into the model group and control group, with three rats per group. A modified method of external closure to block the femoral artery blood flow (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) was used, and the ischemic model was achieved by blocking the blood flow to the lower limbs for 4 hours.

Reperfusion following ischemia exacerbates damage beyond ischemia alone, yet the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated, and effective treatments are limited. Due to the scarcity of limb-specific IRI data, this study utilized model network analysis of cardiac IRI gene expression data to explore shared pathological features and immune infiltration dynamics, offering insights into limb IRI pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets by leveraging cross-tissue mechanistic similarities.</p><sec id="s4_1"><label>4.1</label><title>Enrichment results and intrinsic links to limb IRI</title><p>GO functional enrichment analysis of DEGs revealed multiple biological processes and signaling pathways involved in IRI. First, epithelial fluid transport plays a crucial role in maintaining fluid balance and cellular homeostasis; during ischemia, inadequate energy supply disrupts ion pump and channel function, affecting fluid transport, and exacerbating tissue edema and cell damage (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Second, type II interferons (e.g., IFN-&#x003b3;) play key roles in inflammation and immune regulation. During IRI, increased IFN-&#x003b3; expression activates macrophages and T cells, promoting inflammation, but excessive inflammatory responses may exacerbate tissue damage (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The regulation of fluid levels is crucial for maintaining cellular and tissue functions, as fluid balance systems are activated to restore normal levels when IRI causes increased vascular permeability and fluid leakage leading to edema. Studies (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) have shown that hypoxia response is a core mechanism of IRI, where ischemia leads to insufficient oxygen supply, prompting cells to activate hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) to adapt to the hypoxic environment. HIF regulates the expression of multiple genes, promoting angiogenesis and metabolic reprogramming, but prolonged hypoxia may result in energy depletion and cell death. Angiogenesis also plays a vital role in restoring blood supply to damaged tissues during IRI. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other pro-angiogenic factors are activated to promote new blood vessel formation. However, dysregulated angiogenesis may lead to abnormal vascular structures and impair tissue repair (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Platelets are essential for hemostasis and wound healing, but endothelial cell damage induced by IRI can activate platelets, forming thrombi and affecting blood flow (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Additionally, the extracellular matrix (ECM) supports cell structure and function, but dysregulation of ECM degradation and reconstruction during IRI can impede tissue repair. Secretory granules and vesicles play crucial roles in cell communication and material transport, but IRI can affect their formation and release, disrupting intercellular signaling and material exchange, further impacting tissue function and repair (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The nuclear membrane protects the nucleus and regulates gene expression, and oxidative stress and inflammation from IRI can compromise its integrity, affecting gene expression and cell function. Growth factors are critical in cell proliferation, differentiation, and repair, and changes in growth factor activity during IRI can influence tissue regeneration and repair; excessive or insufficient growth factor signaling may lead to abnormal tissue responses. Molecular isolation mechanisms regulate the intracellular environment and prevent the spread of damaging factors. IRI leads to cell damage and death, breaking these isolation mechanisms and spreading damaging factors, exacerbating tissue injury. Cytokines are key in regulating immune responses and inflammation. During IRI, cytokine release increases, activating inflammatory responses. While this response helps clear damage and pathogens, excessive cytokine responses may cause inflammatory injury (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>KEGG analysis results showed that fluid shear stress, relaxin signaling, and calcium signaling pathways have important intrinsic connections in ischemia-reperfusion injury. Fluid shear stress is the tangential force exerted by blood flow on vascular endothelial cells and plays a key role in maintaining endothelial cell function and structural integrity (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Under normal physiological conditions, stable shear stress promotes anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties of endothelial cells. However, during ischemia-reperfusion, sudden restoration of blood flow causes drastic changes in shear stress, leading to endothelial cell activation and damage. Studies have shown that changes in shear stress can activate endothelial inflammation and increase the expression of cell adhesion molecules like VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, promoting atherosclerosis development. Relaxin is a polypeptide hormone that regulates vascular function by activating multiple signaling pathways, including cAMP, NO, and calcium signaling, via its receptor (RXFP1). Relaxin signaling plays an essential role in regulating vascular tension, reducing fibrosis, and mitigating inflammatory responses (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). During IRI, relaxin can reduce ischemic injury by promoting vasodilation and improving microcirculation. It also inhibits the expression of fibrosis-related genes, reducing fibrosis during reperfusion. Calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are critical second messengers within cells, regulating various cellular functions, including contraction, secretion, and metabolism (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Studies have indicated that dysregulation of calcium signaling is a primary cause of cell damage and death during IRI. Ischemia leads to ATP depletion, impairing calcium pump function and causing intracellular calcium overload. Upon reperfusion, oxidative stress further exacerbates calcium overload, activating calcium-dependent proteases (e.g., calpain) and phospholipases, disrupting cell structure and function. Additionally, calcium overload can induce mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in apoptosis and necrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4_2"><label>4.2</label><title>Intrinsic links between key genes WNT5A, PLCG, ITPR1, CAMK2A, and limb IRI</title><p>This study identified 116 upregulated genes and 53 downregulated genes from microarray analysis. Machine learning analysis further screened out four key genes related to the IRI pathogenesis (WNT5A, PLCG, ITPR1, CAMK2A), which were validated through animal experiments. WNT5A, a critical member of the Wnt signaling pathway, is involved in regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration. In skeletal muscle IRI, the expression of WNT5A is significantly upregulated, indicating its role in inflammation and apoptosis regulation. Research suggests that WNT5A activates calcium signaling through the non-canonical Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway, causing calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm, further activating calcium-dependent proteases (e.g., calpain) to promote the release of inflammatory mediators and apoptosis. Additionally, WNT5A regulates angiogenesis and fibrosis, influencing tissue repair and regeneration after injury (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). For example, WNT5A promotes endothelial cell migration and proliferation, enhancing new blood vessel formation to improve blood supply to ischemic tissues. PLCG is a crucial signal transduction molecule responsible for transmitting extracellular signals to the intracellular environment, triggering various physiological responses. PLCG hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3), where IP3 binds to its receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, inducing calcium release into the cytoplasm and regulating intracellular calcium signaling. In skeletal muscle IRI, PLCG activation increases intracellular calcium concentration, leading to calcium overload, which induces apoptosis and necrosis (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Moreover, PLCG activates the PKC pathway, promoting the release of inflammatory factors and exacerbating inflammation. ITPR1 is a calcium release channel on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane that regulates intracellular calcium release. In skeletal muscle IRI, excessive activation of ITPR1 leads to a rapid increase in intracellular calcium, triggering calcium-dependent enzymes such as calpain and phospholipase A2, causing damage to cell membranes and cytoskeleton. Additionally, abnormal ITPR1 activation can lead to mitochondrial calcium overload, inducing oxidative stress and apoptosis. Research (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) suggests that ITPR1 plays a pivotal role in calcium signaling regulation, making it a critical molecule in cell survival regulation. CAMK2A is a key regulatory enzyme in the calcium signaling pathway that regulates various cellular functions. In skeletal muscle IRI, CAMK2A modulates cell growth, metabolism, and apoptosis by phosphorylating downstream effectors. Studies indicate that CAMK2A exerts protective effects by regulating mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Specifically, CAMK2A regulates mitochondrial calcium channels to prevent excessive calcium accumulation, protecting mitochondrial function and reducing cell death. However, overactivation of CAMK2A may also lead to calcium overload and cell death, suggesting its dual role in IRI.</p></sec><sec id="s4_3"><label>4.3</label><title>Analysis of immune infiltration results</title><p>During limb IRI, changes in the numbers of different types of immune cells reflect complex pathological mechanisms and immune responses. Specifically, the levels of plasma cells, T cells follicular helper, macrophages M0, and macrophages M2 decreased, while macrophages M1, dendritic cells resting, and mast cells activated increased, collectively contributing to the onset and progression of IRI. Plasma cells, which differentiate from B cells, mainly function to secrete large amounts of antibodies (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). During ischemia-reperfusion injury, the deterioration of the local microenvironment and persistent inflammation suppress plasma cell survival and function. The hypoxic conditions induced by ischemia and oxidative stress during reperfusion damage plasma cells, reducing their numbers. Furthermore, the continuous inflammatory response through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6) further inhibits plasma cell survival and function. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells play crucial roles in regulating B cell activation and antibody production. The reduction in Tfh cells during IRI may be due to T cell exhaustion caused by high-intensity inflammation and tissue damage. Strong oxidative stress and inflammation induced by reperfusion consume many Tfh cells, reducing their numbers and functions. Additionally, Tfh cells are sensitive to cytokines and chemokines in the local environment, and changes in these signals may also contribute to the reduction of Tfh cells (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Macrophages M0 can polarize into pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages in response to local microenvironment signals (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). During IRI, the decrease in M0 macrophages may be associated with their rapid polarization into M1 and M2 macrophages. Tissue damage and inflammatory signals caused by ischemia and reperfusion rapidly activate M0 macrophages, polarizing them into M1 or M2 to respond to injury and initiate repair (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). M2 macrophages have anti-inflammatory and tissue repair functions. However, although M2 macrophages play a crucial role in the later stages of tissue repair during IRI, the early strong inflammatory response and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6) may inhibit M2 macrophage production and function. Oxidative stress and tissue damage induced by reperfusion may impair the anti-inflammatory effects of M2 macrophages and increase the proportion of M1 macrophages to balance local immune responses. Unlike the cells mentioned above, M1 macrophages are the primary pro-inflammatory effector cells. During ischemia-reperfusion injury, M1 macrophages participate in the pathological process by secreting high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6) and producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). M1 macrophages help clear necrotic tissue and pathogens in the early stages of IRI, but their overactivation may lead to secondary damage and tissue injury. Resting dendritic cells play a key role in immune surveillance and antigen presentation. Dendritic cells can capture and process antigens and present them to T cells to initiate a specific immune response. In skeletal muscle IRI, dendritic cell activation can amplify the inflammatory response by inducing T and B cell responses and regulating other immune cell migration and functions through cytokine and chemokine secretion (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). This process is crucial for the initial immune response and long-term tissue repair. Activated mast cells are key cells involved in acute inflammation and allergic reactions. In skeletal muscle IRI, mast cells rapidly induce vasodilation, increased permeability, and local inflammation by releasing histamine, tryptase, and other mediators. These mediators promote leukocyte exudation and migration, exacerbating local inflammation and tissue damage (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Although mast cells play a vital role in the initial immune response, their overactivation may lead to excessive inflammation and tissue injury.</p></sec><sec id="s4_4"><label>4.4</label><title>Correlation between key genes and immune cell infiltration</title><p>During IRI, immune cell infiltration and functional regulation play critical roles in damage progression and repair. Our study found that certain key genes play crucial roles in regulating immune cell infiltration: the key genes WNT5A, PLCG, CAMK2A, and ITPR1 showed positive or negative correlations with specific types of immune cells, reflecting their significant roles in regulating immune cell infiltration and function. The WNT5A gene is negatively correlated with memory B cells and memory CD4+ T cells during IRI. WNT5A is a key member of the Wnt signaling pathway, widely involved in cell differentiation, migration, and tissue repair. Its negative correlation may be due to enhanced local inflammation during ischemia and reperfusion, leading to upregulated WNT5A expression, which suppresses the survival and function of memory B and memory CD4+ T cells. High levels of WNT5A may inhibit these memory cells&#x02019; infiltration into damaged tissues by regulating cytoskeletal and migration-related signaling pathways, preventing excessive immune responses that could cause further tissue damage (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The PLCG gene is positively correlated with NK cell activation. PLCG plays a key role in multiple cell signaling pathways, particularly in regulating immune cell function. PLCG participates in receptor-mediated signal transduction, regulating calcium release and PKC activation, enhancing NK cell activity and cytotoxic function. During IRI, upregulated PLCG expression may promote NK cell activation and enhanced function, allowing more efficient clearance of damaged or degenerated cells, thereby playing a crucial role in the early immune response (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The CAMK2A gene is positively correlated with naive B cells. CAMK2A is a critical regulator of intracellular calcium signaling, essential for multiple cellular functions. Calcium signaling is vital for B cell proliferation, differentiation, and antibody production. CAMK2A promotes naive B cell activation and enhanced function by regulating intracellular calcium levels. During IRI, upregulated CAMK2A expression may enable naive B cells to play a more significant role in the early immune response, helping the body quickly respond to injury (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The ITPR1 gene is positively correlated with &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T cells. ITPR1 is a key receptor that regulates intracellular calcium release and participates in various cell functions (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Calcium signaling is crucial for &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T cell activation and function. &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T cells are a special class of T cells in the immune system with rapid response capabilities to infection and injury. ITPR1 enhances &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T cell activity and function by regulating intracellular calcium release. During IRI, upregulated ITPR1 expression may promote &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T cell activation, enabling a rapid and robust response in the early immune reaction, contributing to early damage control and repair. Studying these genes not only aids in understanding the pathological processes of IRI but also provides a theoretical basis for developing new therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4_5"><label>4.5</label><title>Limitations and future work</title><p>This study, while offering valuable insights into limb IRI using cardiac IRI gene expression data (GSE36073) and rat models, has several significant limitations that merit detailed discussion. The GSE36073 dataset, derived from CTGF-stimulated adult cardiac myocytes rather than limb IRI samples, was chosen due to the scarcity of high-quality limb-specific datasets in GEO. Our approach is justified by substantial evidence supporting shared inflammatory and immune pathways between cardiac and limb IRI (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), but tissue-specific differences undoubtedly exist and may influence the interpretation of our findings.</p><p>A critical methodological limitation of our study is the absence of objective blood flow measurements during the ischemia and reperfusion periods. We acknowledge that Doppler ultrasonography or laser speckle contrast imaging would have provided quantitative verification of blood perfusion cessation during ischemia and restoration during reperfusion. This objective validation would have standardized injury severity across experimental animals and enhanced reproducibility. Our visual assessment of limb pallor and post-ischemic hyperemia, while established in the literature, lacks the precision offered by these advanced imaging techniques. The variability in ischemic severity that may have resulted from this limitation could potentially influence gene expression patterns and immune cell recruitment dynamics.</p><p>Another significant limitation is the lack of immunohistochemical validation of the immune cell infiltration patterns predicted by our computational CIBERSORT analysis. While CIBERSORT provides valuable insights into immune cell composition based on gene expression signatures, direct visualization and quantification of specific immune cell populations using immunohistochemical staining would have provided more definitive evidence of immune cell dynamics during IRI. The predicted changes in macrophage polarization (M0, M1, M2), dendritic cells, mast cells, and lymphocyte populations require histological confirmation with specific cellular markers to strengthen our conclusions about immune involvement in limb IRI.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, we recognize that our study lacks functional validation of the identified hub genes (WNT5A, PLCG, ITPR1, CAMK2A). While we have demonstrated their differential expression and correlation with immune cell populations, we have not established causal relationships between these genes and IRI pathophysiology. Gene knockdown or overexpression experiments would have provided direct evidence of their roles in the inflammatory response, cell death, and tissue repair processes during limb IRI. This represents a fundamental limitation of our current work, as functional validation is essential for translating correlative findings into mechanistic insights with therapeutic potential.</p><p>To address these constraints, we propose a comprehensive roadmap for future research that would substantively advance this field:</p><p>First, we will implement standardized protocols for objective assessment of limb ischemia and reperfusion using Doppler ultrasonography or laser speckle contrast imaging. This will enable precise quantification of blood flow cessation during ischemia and restoration during reperfusion, ensuring consistent injury severity across experimental subjects. These measurements will be correlated with molecular and cellular responses to establish relationships between perfusion dynamics and pathological processes.</p><p>Second, to validate and extend our computational predictions of immune cell infiltration, we will conduct extensive immunohistochemical analyses of limb tissues following IRI. This will include staining for markers of macrophages (CD68, CD80 for M1, CD206 for M2), neutrophils (MPO), T-cell subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8), B cells (CD19), dendritic cells (CD11c), and mast cells (tryptase, c-Kit). Multiplex immunofluorescence will allow simultaneous visualization of multiple immune cell populations, providing spatial and temporal information about their interactions during the course of IRI.</p><p>Third, to establish the functional roles of our identified hub genes, we plan to conduct <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments using both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. For <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, we will use RNA interference (siRNA or shRNA) to knockdown each hub gene in skeletal muscle cells subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation, measuring effects on cell viability, inflammatory cytokine production, and oxidative stress. Complementary overexpression studies using plasmid vectors will determine whether increased expression of these genes is protective or detrimental. For <italic>in vivo</italic> validation, we will utilize adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for local delivery of gene-specific shRNA or overexpression constructs to rat limbs prior to IRI induction, assessing effects on tissue damage, inflammatory infiltration, and functional recovery.</p><p>Finally, recognizing the limitations of cross-tissue extrapolation, future studies will prioritize the collection and analysis of human limb tissue samples from patients undergoing procedures involving controlled ischemia (e.g., tourniquet application during orthopedic surgery) or from patients with acute limb ischemia. This direct approach will overcome the cross-tissue limitations of the current study and provide clinically relevant insights into human limb IRI pathophysiology.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study employed a cross-tissue approach, integrating well-characterized cardiac IRI data (GSE36073) with a rat limb IRI model to systematically identify key genes and mechanisms underlying IRI. By leveraging shared inflammatory pathways, we constructed a biological network model from cardiac data and identified WNT5A, PLCG, ITPR1, and CAMK2A as pivotal regulators of limb IRI pathogenesis. Immune infiltration analysis further revealed a distinct immune landscape, characterized by decreased plasma cells, follicular helper T cells, M0 macrophages, and M2 macrophages, alongside increased M1 macrophages, resting dendritic cells, and activated mast cells. Correlation analyses indicated that WNT5A suppresses memory B and CD4+ T cell survival, PLCG enhances NK cell activation, CAMK2A promotes na&#x000ef;ve B cell function, and ITPR1 correlates with &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T cell activity&#x02014;highlighting immune responses as critical therapeutic targets.</p><p>The observed activation of the WNT5A-PLC-CaMKII axis in our model aligns with established inflammatory pathways (<xref rid="f11" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figures&#x000a0;11</bold>
</xref>, <xref rid="f12" ref-type="fig">

</xref>). While direct measurement of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;) was not performed, previous studies have demonstrated that this signaling cascade potently induces pro-inflammatory cytokine production via NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Histological evidence from the Model Group (<xref rid="f13" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure&#x000a0;13</bold>
</xref>) further supports this mechanism, suggesting that inflammatory cascades are conserved across cardiac and limb IRI models.</p><p>HE staining revealed generalized inflammation, including karyorrhexis and granulocyte clusters, but lacked specificity for immune subsets. Future studies should incorporate immunohistochemistry (IHC) with CD68+ (macrophages) and MPO+ (neutrophils) markers to spatiotemporally characterize immune cell dynamics, as outlined in our roadmap (Section 4.6). Despite these limitations, our HE/qPCR data provide mechanistic insights into the &#x0201c;calcium dysregulation &#x02192; inflammation amplification&#x0201d; axis, with WNT5A emerging as a potential link between calcium signaling and immune activation. Previous work has shown that WNT5A promotes M1 macrophage polarization via NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), a process likely exacerbated in ischemic tissues, suggesting a dual role in both calcium-mediated cytotoxicity and immune modulation.</p><p>Although pharmacological inhibition (Box5/U-73122) effectively reduced target protein expression (<xref rid="f11" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure&#x000a0;11</bold>
</xref>), potential off-target effects cannot be excluded. To refine our findings, future studies will employ AAV9-shWNT5A delivery for cell-specific gene silencing and single-cell RNA sequencing to map cell type&#x02013;specific responses.</p><p>Through interdisciplinary collaboration and methodological innovation, this study advances the potential of cross-tissue analysis for IRI prevention and treatment, offering new clinical prospects for patients with limb ischemic conditions. Despite its limitations, our findings provide a valuable framework for future investigations into the molecular mechanisms of limb IRI.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets analyzed for this study can be found in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE36073.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s7"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The animal study was approved by Henan University of Chinese Medicine.
