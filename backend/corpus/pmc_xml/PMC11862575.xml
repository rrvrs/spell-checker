Having resurfaced in the mainstream culture as a mythical figure, he appears to be enjoying a renaissance of posthumous recognition and praise. Throughaccounts available directly from his autobiography and descriptions offered by those who worked with him, the existence of the inventor&#x000b4;s <italic toggle="yes">eccentricities</italic> appear to reveal the existence of mental health disorder.</p></sec><sec id="sec3157"><title>Objectives</title><p>The authors explore Tesla and the psychopathology that accompanied him throughout his periods of brilliance and as well as hardship.</p></sec><sec id="sec3158"><title>Methods</title><p>The authors conducted a brief non-structured narrative literature review. The keywords used during the research, alone or in combination, included: Nikola Tesla, psychopathology and mental illness. The works consulted included: news articles, autobiographies and biographies. Of these, those that were written in the English language and deemed most pertinent to the explored theme were chosen for review in this work.</p></sec><sec id="sec3159"><title>Results</title><p>The popular image of the <italic toggle="yes">mad scientist</italic>, which describes a brilliant but solitary and eccentric individual focused on their work is one that could be applied to Tesla. Documents reveal that he suffered a nervous breakdown, as well as having symptoms that point to a probably presence of obsessive-compulsive disorder, of which included counting and cleanliness rituals, exacerbated by chronic insomnia.</p></sec><sec id="sec3160"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There appears to be anecdotal evidence pointing to an eventual relationship between creative genius and mental pathology. Although not formally evidenced through the scientific literature, exploring the life and accomplishments of Tesla serve as a significant example of a spark of genius perhaps ignited by mental illness. Tesla demonstrated suffering associated with his symptoms especially when considering the end of his life. At the time, adequate mental health interventions and treatments were not widely available, with his diagnosis probably being considered the quirks of genius and not the symptoms of disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec3161"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
