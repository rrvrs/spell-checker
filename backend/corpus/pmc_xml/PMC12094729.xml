</self-uri><abstract><sec id="sec013"><title>Introduction</title><p>Young people with disabilities face major barriers in accessing sexual reproductive health (SRH) services in resource-poor settings, including Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). Although, there is increasing recognition of their unique SRH needs, the availability, acceptability, and uptake of SRH service delivery interventions for this population group remain understudied. Young people with disabilities encounter barriers to accessing SRH services due to stigma, poverty, lack of information and physical barriers. We aim to map existing literature on SRH service delivery interventions targeting young people with disabilities in SSA through a scoping review.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The scoping review will be guided by the Arksey and O&#x02019;Malley methodological framework. Articles will be searched in PubMed, African Index Medicus, Google Scholar, African Journals Online, Web of Science and Embase electronic databases as well as grey literature database, Open Grey. We will also do a citation search of references of eligible papers for literature that may have been overlooked in other searches. A two-step process will be used to screen retrieved articles i) title and abstract screening ii) full text screening. Results of the scoping review will be reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-P) extension for scoping reviews.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Discussion</title><p>There is a paucity of knowledge on availability, acceptability and uptake of SRH service delivery interventions for young people with disabilities in SSA. This scoping review is poised to fill the gap by demonstrating the breadth of literature on availability, acceptability and uptake of SRH service delivery interventions for young people with disabilities The scoping review aims to map the availability of SRH service delivery interventions for young people with disabilities. This mapping of evidence has the potential to identify whether there is a need for SRH service delivery interventions for young people with disabilities. Our scoping review will map which SRH service delivery interventions work or do not work, as well as gaps in SRH service delivery interventions for young people with disabilities. This information is useful for policy making and for designing effective SRH service delivery interventions for young people with disabilities.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="7"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>No data is associated with the current submission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>No data is associated with the current submission.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates there are 1.3 billion people living with disabilities globally in 2025, including 220 million young people [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Majority of these young people, over 80%, live in low-income countries including Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Young people with disabilities (YPWD) have the worst socio-economic and health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. They are most likely to be living in poverty, attained low levels of education, living in poor environments and/or unemployed [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. YPWD are much less likely to be screened for HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), cervical and breast cancer, less likely to have received comprehensive sexuality education and less likely to have access to contraception [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The lack of information and scarcity of accessible services exacerbates their vulnerability [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>While the provision of SRH services to people with disabilities is a constitutional right in many SSA countries and an international obligation under United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESR), access to services remains a challenge [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although young people in general have unmet SRH needs [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], YPWD are worse off as a result of multiple intersecting barriers which prevent access to SRH services.</p><p>Evidence from SSA demonstrates several SRH service delivery interventions for young people in general [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. SRH service delivery interventions for young people in general in SSA focus on HIV prevention and treatment, maternal services, sexual health education, STI services, contraception services, peer education on SRH issues and many others [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There is also evidence of availability of SRH service delivery interventions for YWPD focusing on provision of sexuality education, HIV prevention and treatment and support for YWPD who survive sexual and domestic violence [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Kassa et al., show few national programs in Ethiopia seeking to address the SRH needs of YPWD [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In most countries in SSA, Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are usually front runners in implementing SRH service delivery interventions targeting YPWD [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, NGO-driven interventions tend to have low coverage and are often not sustainable [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Extant literature identifies several barriers which limit YPWD from accessing SRH services. YWPD are stigmatised and considered asexual; a misconception widely shared among health workers and the general population alike [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. YPWD fail to access SRH services because of inaccessible health facilities, insensitivity of health care workers, limited information on disability among health care workers, and lack of information by YPWD [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. YPWD are further excluded from accessing SRH services due to transport challenges, user fees, long waiting times, need for an assistant and lack of confidentiality [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. YPWD are perceived by some health workers as an additional burden to an already burdened health system [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This emanates from preconceived notions on disabilities, causing some health workers to view YPWD as more challenging for care, making them less keen to offer services [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The way in which majority of SRH service delivery interventions are designed potentially limits access to SRH services by YPWD [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is assumed that SRH service delivery interventions designed for general young people, will somehow reach YPWD [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This belief fails to appreciate the unique experiences of YPWD, and this has motivated some non-state actors such as NGOs to design SRH interventions for YPWD. Care should be taken when designing SRH service delivery interventions for young people and ensure they are inclusive of YPWD [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. SRH service delivery interventions for YWPD potentially have better outcomes when they are included in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Demonstrated above are several challenges faced by YPWD in accessing SRH services. We have designed this scoping review to explore the breadth of literature on availability, acceptability and uptake of SRH service delivery interventions for YPWD. It transcends other studies which focused on people with disabilities in general [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], women with disabilities [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and specific disabilities [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The scoping review will generate evidence on SRH programming for YPWD, mapping evidence on interventions that work well or do not work well and gaps in SRH service provision. This evidence is useful to practitioners and policy makers in addressing unmet SRH needs for YPWD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Protocol design</title><p>Our scoping review will employ the framework developed by Arksey and O&#x02019;Malley [<xref rid="pone.0324364.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] consisting of five stages i) identifying the research questions, ii) identifying the relevant studies, iii) study selection, iv) charting the data, iv) collating, summarizing and reporting the results.

Initially, we will pilot the charting tool on 10 randomly selected studies and assess its usability and comprehensiveness.

However, there is a paucity of knowledge on availability, acceptability and uptake of SRH service delivery interventions for YPWD. Our scoping review is posed to fill the gap by demonstrating the breadth of literature on availability, acceptability and uptake of SRH service delivery interventions for YPWD. Currently it remains unknown which SRH service delivery interventions for YPWD are available. Mapping evidence of availability of interventions is needed to make recommendations to policy makers and programmers whether there is any need of specific SRH service delivery interventions for YPWD. Additionally, our scoping review will map which interventions work and do not work as well as gaps in SRH service delivery interventions for YPWD. This consolidated evidence will be useful to inform policymakers and practitioners in designing effective SRH service delivery interventions to reach YPWD. Based on the findings of the scoping review, we will also be able to recommend any areas needing primary research.</p><p>Potential limitation of the study is exclusion of studies not in English as we are constrained in terms of resources to include studies in other languages. We are aware that exclusion of non-English papers potentially introduce bias. Though there is option to use Google Translate for studies not in English, we worry that it may not always accurately convey the nuances of scientific terminology or complex ideas, which may potentially lead to misinterpretations of concepts. However, we believe identified English studies in SSA will be a useful gauge of the breadth of literature on availability, acceptability and uptake of SRH service delivery interventions for YPWD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec011"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study will fill knowledge gaps on availability, acceptability and uptake of SRH service delivery interventions for YPWD.

The manuscript is well-written. However, I would like to provide a few suggestions for revising the manuscript.</p><p>Title and Abstract</p><p>The title accurately reflects the focus of the study: &#x0201c;Availability, acceptability, and uptake of sexual reproductive health interventions for young people with disabilities in Sub-Saharan Africa.&#x0201d; However, there is a minor grammatical issue in the title: "African" should be "Africa" (i.e., Sub-Saharan Africa instead of Sub-Saharan African).</p><p>The abstract clearly states the research problem, methodology, and expected contribution of the study. However, the research gap could be articulated more strongly. For instance, instead of broadly stating that knowledge is limited, the authors should specify which aspects of SRH interventions remain particularly underexplored (e.g., policy gaps, service delivery models).</p><p>The discussion in the abstract could better explain the practical implications of the study, particularly how it informs policy and programming.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>The introduction effectively frames the importance of SRH services for young people with disabilities. It provides statistical data and international policy references (e.g., CRPD, ICESCR), making it a strong foundation. However, some areas need improvement:</p><p>i. Several points (e.g., stigma, inaccessibility of SRH services, exclusion from interventions) are mentioned multiple times. A more concise presentation of these barriers would improve readability.</p><p>ii. Concepts like "buy-in," "existential realities," and "coterie of challenges" could be simplified or replaced with more precise language to enhance accessibility.</p><p>iii. The introduction focuses on challenges or barriers to accessing SRH interventions (stated broadly) without addressing availability as an important variable. The study fails to highlight the existing interventions for the general population and those specific to young people with disabilities. Discussing availability first would provide a clearer framework for assessing accessibility and mapping out which interventions work and which do not. The scoping review would be strengthened by incorporating this important variable.</p><p>Methodology</p><p>The methodology is robust and follows the Arksey and O&#x02019;Malley scoping review framework. However, a few areas need clarification:</p><p>While a list of databases is provided, the authors should include details on:</p><p>i. How search terms were combined using Boolean operators (e.g., AND, OR).</p><p>ii. Whether any language restrictions were applied beyond English.</p><p>iii. Whether gray literature sources (e.g., NGO reports, government documents) will be systematically appraised.</p><p>The authors state that two reviewers will independently screen articles, but how will discrepancies be handled if the third reviewer is unavailable?</p><p>Will any software (e.g., Rayyan, Covidence) be used to ensure consistency in the review process?</p><p>The authors mention CASP checklists and RoB tools, but scoping reviews typically do not conduct quality appraisal. They should clarify why these tools are relevant in this context.</p><p>The manuscript states that no ethical approval is required because only secondary data is used. However, it would be beneficial to acknowledge any potential ethical concerns regarding the representation of people with disabilities in research.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>The discussion explains the gaps in SRH services for young people with disabilities and the potential contribution of the review. However:</p><p>The statement: "Our study will fill knowledge gaps on availability, acceptability, and uptake of SRH interventions for young people with disabilities." is overly broad. This gap has not been clearly established based on the review, and it needs to be explicitly defined. The authors should specify which aspects of these interventions they aim to address, as previously mentioned. Importantly, a scoping review does not evaluate effectiveness; it maps available literature.</p><p>The exclusion of non-English studies is noted as a limitation, but the authors should discuss how this might bias the findings (e.g., missing key studies from Francophone and Lusophone African countries). This exclusion could lead to an incomplete review.</p><p>"There is paucity of knowledge" should be corrected to "There is a paucity of knowledge."</p><p>Some long sentences could be broken down for better clarity. The paper would benefit from an editorial review for grammatical errors and sentence structure improvements.</p><p>Some claims, especially regarding barriers to SRH services, stigma, and discrimination, lack proper citations. Every statement making a claim about accessibility or service delivery should be backed by references.</p><p>The manuscript does not explicitly outline areas for further research. A strong scoping review should conclude with recommendations on which SRH interventions need further study, the need for primary research in specific areas where literature is lacking, and how policies and programmes should be tailored based on the findings.</p><p>The manuscript is well-structured and covers an important topic. However, addressing the issues of availability, clarifying methodological details, tightening the discussion, and ensuring proper citation of claims will significantly improve the quality of the paper. Additionally, a final editorial review for grammar and clarity is recommended.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. Overall, this is an interesting topic and a well-written manuscript. I raised some issues and provided recommendations below:</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>1. Provide a date/year for this data: &#x0201c;The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that there are 1 billion people living with disabilities globally, including 220 million young people.&#x0201d;</p><p>2. Paragraph 2 is too long. A paragraph may not exclude 12 lines.</p><p>3. This statement appears unclear: &#x0201c;SRH interventions for young people with disabilities fail because of lack of buy-in as well as being divorced from their contextual experiences and realities of living with disabilities.&#x0201d;</p><p>METHODS</p><p>4. The disability context should include the &#x0201c;people living with disability&#x0201d; keyword.</p><p>5. You may have to include MeSH terms for the constructs. For example, disability has the "Persons with Disabilities"[Mesh] MeSH term, while sub-Saharan Africa has a MeSH in PubMed: "Africa South of the Sahara"[Mesh].</p><p>6. There is a need to incorporate * to explode some terms. For example, some authors may use the phrase &#x0201c;sexual behaviour&#x0201d; (British language), while others may use &#x0201c;sexual behavior&#x0201d; (American English). To capture both simultaneously, you may include the * and write it as &#x0201c;sexual behavi*&#x0201d;. Another example is youth. I would write youth* to capture both youth and youths.</p><p>7. The number of countries in the sub-saharan Africa concept is incomplete. Eswatini, Mauritania, and Mauritius are missing. Furthermore, please include &#x0201c;West Africa,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;East Africa,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Southern Africa,&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Central Africa&#x0201d; because some authors focus on multiple countries within the same region and report regions rather than individual countries.</p><p>8. Single terms such as disabled, Congo, etc. do not need to be in quote. &#x0201c; &#x0201c; is used for two or more words to make them &#x0201c;one&#x0201d; or turn them into phrases.</p><p>9. Please note that Embase uses emtree (similar to MeSH) terms. Please use the available emtree in Embase for a more comprehensive search.</p><p>10. I can see from Table 2 that the authors plan to remove non-English articles. I strongly discourage that because there are tools that can translate documents now. Google Translate does a good job, too. So, this is no longer a valid exclusion criterion because non-English articles matter.</p><p>11. Is there a justification for limiting the search to 2000-2025?</p><p>DISCUSSION</p><p>12. I discussed the issue of excluding non-English studies.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;I appreciate the invitation to perform this review. In my opinion, the protocol was satisfactorily written with all the necessary components needed included and detailed information of step by step procedures of the methodology included. it is a well written protocol explicit and detailed.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
