The aim of our study was to assess physicians&#x02019; knowledge and attitudes towards sexuality in the elderly in Tunisia and to determine variables associated with the level of knowledge and the nature of attitudes in this population.</p></sec><sec id="sec8705"><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of our study was to assess physicians&#x02019; knowledge and attitudes towards sexuality in the elderly in Tunisia and to determine variables associated with the level of knowledge and the nature of attitudes in this population.</p></sec><sec id="sec8706"><title>Methods</title><p>A descriptive and analytical study was conducted among specialists and medical residents of all specialties, practicing in Tunisia and recruited anonymously online. We included questions on socio-demographic data, medical specialty and medical training of physicians as well as a French translation of the Aging Sexual Knowlesge and Atttidues Scale (ASKAS). We determined correlations between the socio-demographic and medical training variables and the ASKAS score among participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec8707"><title>Results</title><p>We included 74 physicians in the study. Sixty-two percent of the doctors surveyed sometimes asked elderly patients about their sexuality (N=46) and the rest of the doctors never mentioned the subject during a medical consultation (N=28). The major obstacles reported when discussing sexuality with the elderly were: a feeling discomfort related to sexuality considered a taboo subject (77%), lack of information and skills (51%) and the duration and setting of the medical consultation considered inadequate (45%). The mean score for the knowledge subcategory of the Aging Sexual Knowledge and Atittudes Scale (ASKAS) was 68.49&#x000b1;5.5 and for the attitudes subcategory was 83.74&#x000b1;4.2. These results indicated a moderate level of knowledge and moderate to negative attitudes.</p><p>There was a significant and negative correlation between age and the ASKAS knowledge subcategory score (r= -0.75, p=0.026), as well as a significant positive correlation between the knowledge and attitudes subcategories scores and sexology training (p&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>The correlation between the knowledge score and the attitudes score was significant, positive, and good (r=0.788, p&#x0003c;0.001): the lower the level of knowledge, the more negative the attitudes regarding elderly sexuality.</p></sec><sec id="sec8708"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There are several gaps in the knowledge and perceptions of Tunisian physicians regarding the sexuality of older subjects. Theoretical teaching and practical anti-ageing training for health professionals are needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec8709"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
