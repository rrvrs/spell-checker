Notably, DR is characterized by neovascularization and neurodegeneration, which interact with each other and cooperate to promote DR progression. Hyperglycemia is the primary cause of DR and induces pathophysiological fluxes, including inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and metabolic imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, early neurodegeneration in DR is considered an initiating factor of vascular damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], meanwhile, neovascularization in DR originates from the retinal vessels. The neuronal components of the retina are compromised in DR; in particular, M&#x000fc;ller cells are polarized and retinal ganglion cells die early in DR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Functional studies of the retina under diabetic conditions supported observations made using electroretinography, dark adaptation, contrast sensitivity, and color vision tests, revealing that neuronal function decreased before the onset of vascular lesions in both humans and animal models of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The underlying reasons for early neuronal cell impairment in diabetic retina are not well understood. However, one study reported increased levels of neurodegenerative metabolites in diabetic retinas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Glutamate is one of the major excitotoxic metabolites that is elevated in the vitreous and retina of patients with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and in animal models of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and may cause neuronal damage in the retina.</p><p id="Par25">Circulating levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), including valine, leucine, and isoleucine, increase in individuals with obesity, insulin resistance (IR), and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, BCAA-related metabolites are predictive of type 2 diabetes pathogenesis and are prognostic markers of intervention outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In our previous studies, elevated levels of BCAAs were detected by MS/MS analysis in the blood plasma, aqueous humor, and vitreous humor of patients with DR, as well as in the serum of <italic>db/db</italic> mice in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In addition, a few studies have reported excess BCAAs in the serum and retina of diabetic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, high levels of BCAAs and related intermediate metabolites are not only biomarkers of type 2 diabetes but also pathophysiological factors involved in diabetic complications. However, few studies have explored how BCAAs regulate cellular homeostasis and affect DR progression. An analysis of changes in BCAAs and related metabolites in response to glucose challenge may provide a novel strategy for ameliorating neuroinflammation in early DR.</p><p id="Par26">To explore the potential regulatory mechanisms of BCAAs associated with neurodegeneration, inflammation, and apoptosis in the diabetic retina, the process of BCAA catabolism was investigated. There are two main steps involved in BCAA metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. First, BCAA transamination yields BCAA catabolites such as branched-chain &#x003b1;-keto acids (BCKAs), &#x003b1;-ketoisovalerate (KIC) from leucine, &#x003b1;-keto-&#x003b2;-methyl valeric acid (KMV) from isoleucine, and &#x003b1;-ketoisobutyrate (KIV) from valine. This reversible step is mediated by branched-chain aminotransferases (BCATs, BCAT1 and BCAT2). Second, irreversible initiation of BCKA oxidation occurs via the BCKA dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex encoded by the BCKDHA and BCKDHB genes. Furthermore, BCKD activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications of phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of BCKD E1&#x003b1; subunit by BCKD kinase (BCKDK) inhibits BCKD, whereas BCKD dephosphorylation by the protein phosphatase 2Cm activates it. These three BCAAs differentially stimulate the protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a key regulator of many metabolic processes, and are involved in the posttranslational modification of distinct proteins. Although the catabolism of each BCAA involves several steps, the intermediate and final products are distinct. Overall, the steps and enzymes involved in BCAA catabolism are closely associated with the accumulation of BCAAs and BCKAs, thus affecting their toxic effects in DR.</p><p id="Par27">This study aimed to assess whether excess BCAAs can further impair BCAA catabolism and neuroinflammation in M&#x000fc;ller cells under hyperglycemic conditions. We hypothesized that BCAA catabolism was hindered under diabetic condition to induce the accumulation of BCAAs and BCKAs, which caused the stimulation of neuroinflammation in M&#x000fc;ller cells. The individual BCAA might played a key role in activating mTORC1 signaling to affect M&#x000fc;ller cell function in DR. This study would also identify the dominant amino acids involved in BCAA catabolism during early DR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental animal study</title><p id="Par28">Seven-week-old male wild-type (WT) and diabetic <italic>db/db</italic> mice were obtained from the Animal Research Center of Shanghai General Hospital.

This hinted us to clarify the essential target to ameliorate DR before angiogenesis and neurodegeneration. Therefore, to investigate the abundance of BCAAs in retinas and other tissues from BCAA-fed WT and db/db mice, LC-MS/MS analysis was performed. Three BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and BCKAs (KIV, KIC, and KMV) were separately quantified in the retinal tissue, plasma, kidney, liver, and heart of each group. BCAA levels in retinal tissues were significantly elevated in <italic>db/db</italic> mice compared to WT mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A).

Moreover, BCAA accumulation in the diabetic retina was further augmented than that in the WT group. Furthermore, KIC, KMV, and KIV were enhanced and augmented by BCAA administration in the retinas of db/db mice than those of WT mice. Notably, BCAAs cannot be endogenously synthesized in animals and are only acquired from food sources. To evaluate the catabolic alteration of BCAAs by additive feeding in diabetic mice, we conducted a targeted metabolomic analysis to characterize BCAA catabolism in <italic>db/db</italic> mice by detecting the abundance of BCAAs and their metabolites in plasma and various tissues.

Furthermore, MS revealed similar specific measurements of plasma BCAA levels in the kidney, liver, and heart (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C&#x02013;E). Gene expression analysis suggested the systemic downregulation of the BCAA catabolic pathway under diabetic conditions.

In WT mice, BCAA administration activated BCAT1, although the difference was not significant compared to that in WT mice.

In M&#x000fc;ller cells cultured under hyperglycemic conditions, BCAA catabolism showed a profile similar to that observed in vivo. BCAAs and BCKAs were induced and accumulated under hyperglycemic conditions in M&#x000fc;ller cells. These parameters were significantly enhanced with the addition of BCAAs. When the high-glucose medium was not treated with BCAAs, these levels decreased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, B). The levels of BCAAs and BCKAs were found to change significantly, especially after 48&#x000a0;h of treatment.

Furthermore, BCKDHA and BCKDHB were decreased, whereas BCKDK was enhanced in high glucose-treated M&#x000fc;ller cells.

In the context of hyperglycemia, M&#x000fc;ller cell apoptosis increased and was further enhanced by the addition of BCAAs, especially at a high dose for 48&#x000a0;h. Unexpectedly, BCAA deprivation accelerated the apoptosis rate of M&#x000fc;ller cells compared to either normal or high-glucose conditions.

To further clarify the dominant amino acid of BCAAs enhancing mTORC1 signaling in M&#x000fc;ller cells under high glucose conditions, separate amino acid was added. Upon BCAA starvation in a high-glucose medium, phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrates p70 S6K and S6K was inhibited. However, when M&#x000fc;ller cells were cultured with leucine added in high glucose without BCAAs, the phosphorylation of mTORC1 was significantly enhanced. Isoleucine alone only increased p-p70 S6K/p70 S6K in cultured M&#x000fc;ller cells under hyperglycemic conditions deprived of BCAAs. Supplementation with valine alone did not affect the activation of mTORC1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, B). In cultured cells, mTORC1 senses leucine through leucine-binding Sestrin proteins, including Sestrin1 and Sestrin2. To determine whether mTORC1 regulation by leucine requires Sestrin1 and Sestrin2, we generated siRNAs targeting Sestrin1/Sestrin2 in M&#x000fc;ller cells cultured with high glucose supplemented with only leucine. In addition, LeuRS plays a crucial role in amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation by sensing intracellular leucine concentration and initiating molecular events that cause mTORC1 activation. Therefore, we performed an interference experiment, in which LeuRS was knocked down. As shown by western blotting, loss of Sestrin1 did not affect the response of mTORC1 to leucine addition, which was enhanced in M&#x000fc;ller cells cultured under hyperglycemic conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C, D). However, Sestrin2 knockdown reduced leucine sensing and significantly inhibited the activation of mTORC1 signaling. These results suggested that Sestrin2 plays a critical role in sensing leucine to regulate mTORC1 activation in vitro under diabetic conditions. In addition, reducing LeuRS levels by siRNA transfection suppressed leucine-induced activation of mTORC1 compared to that in HG medium containing only leucine (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C, D).

Analysis of the tissue distribution of BCAA disposal at the whole-body level revealed that the liver is one of the largest contributors to BCAA disposal into protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, detecting BCAA levels in the liver is important to predict BCAA transportation and metabolism systemically. As reflected by the MS results in this study, BCAA levels were elevated in the liver, and with high-dose BCAA administration, the increase in BCAA levels was further aggravated. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is another common microvascular complication of diabetes. Serum BCAA levels were significantly elevated in patients with T2DM compared to healthy individuals. However, these levels gradually decrease with DKD progression. Serum BCAA levels are independently correlated with renal function indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In addition, the kidneys have abundant BCAA oxidation flux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Under steady-state homeostasis, the BCAAs released from proteins must be either oxidized or reused for protein synthesis. Therefore, the kidney is essential for inducing BCAA oxidation flux to maintain homeostasis. In <italic>db/db</italic> mice, we found that BCAA levels were significantly increased in the kidneys and were further enhanced by <italic>BCAA administration</italic>. However, BCKAs were downregulated under diabetic conditions with or without BCAAs supplementation, indicating a defect in BCAA catabolism. Metabolomic analysis revealed crucial issues associated with BCAA metabolism by identifying the pathological network of metabolic profiles in different tissues.</p><p id="Par53">BCAAs in the retina originate from circulation and transportation. To clarify the mechanism by which BCAAs regulate DR development, we first evaluated the levels of BCAAs and BCKAs in the retinas of <italic>db/db</italic> mice and in M&#x000fc;ller cells exposed to hyperglycemia by MS detection. In this study, a human retinal M&#x000fc;ller cell line-MIO-M1 cell was used in vitro experiments. However, original human cells have not been used. Unsurprisingly, the levels of BCAAs, including leucine, isoleucine, and valine, and BCKAs were significantly increased in the retina and M&#x000fc;ller cells under DR conditions. Feeding mice with BCAAs or supplementation in vitro further aggravated the accumulation of BCAAs and BCKAs. The upregulation of BCAAs and their defective catabolism in various tissues has been proposed to be mainly due to the altered enzymatic activity of BCATs and BCKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The activity of BCATs, the enzyme responsible for BCAA transamination to BCKA, was inhibited under diabetic conditions and was further suppressed by BCAA addition. Subsequently, BCKAs are oxidized by the BCKD complex, which is inhibited by BCKDK. As revealed by protein quantification, BCKDHA and BCKDHB were downregulated in diabetic retinas and hyperglycemia-induced M&#x000fc;ller cells, whereas BCKDK levels increased. When treated with a high dose of BCAAs, the downregulation of BCKDHA and BCKDHB was aggravated and the increase in BCKDK was elevated. This confirmed that the increased levels of BCAAs in the retina and M&#x000fc;ller cells under high glucose conditions were due to reduced BCAT expression and decreased BCKD complex activity via increased BCKDK expression. Accordingly, the first and second steps of BCAA catabolism are impeded in DR. Our results are consistent with the findings in the muscle and liver in obesity and IR in T2DM, which are the main tissues in which BCAA oxidation occurs, contributing to plasma BCAA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In particular, we found that defective BCAA catabolism in the retina under diabetic conditions was exacerbated by BCAA accumulation.</p><p id="Par54">Furthermore, BCAAs activate mTOR signaling, although the mechanisms underlying their effects have not yet been fully elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Increased plasma BCAA levels can lead to persistent mTOR activation via S6 kinase (p70 S6K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Additionally, BCAA-induced stimulation of the mTOR/p70 S6K pathway has been demonstrated in rodent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and cell experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Our previous study confirmed increased mTOR phosphorylation in diabetic retinas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the present study, we further revealed that mTOR activation occurred through the phosphorylation of p70 S6K and S6K in the retinas of <italic>db/db</italic> mice and hyperglycemic M&#x000fc;ller cells. Furthermore, downstream molecules, including those involved in inflammation (TNF-&#x003b1;), angiogenesis (VEGFA), and M&#x000fc;ller cell activation (GS and GFAP), were stimulated. Compared to diabetic conditions, the phosphorylation of proteins involved in the mTOR signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro was higher in diabetic mice treated with exogenous BCAAs. Subsequently, the inflammatory response, angiogenic activity, and M&#x000fc;ller cell activation were further promoted. The flow cytometry results showed that the apoptosis of M&#x000fc;ller cells under hyperglycemic conditions was increased and promoted by upregulated BCAAs. This could be explained by activation of the mTOR signaling pathway, which increases retinal cell apoptosis under DR conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Mitochondrial dysfunction is closely associated with DR development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, mitochondrial health was determined by quantifying the mitochondrial respiration rate (Seahorse) and ATP production rate. In high glucose&#x02013;induced M&#x000fc;ller cells, mitochondrial respiration was impaired, and mitochondrial biogenesis was also impeded. Furthermore, HG significantly inhibited mitochondrial respiratory capacity and ATP production in M&#x000fc;ller cells. Additionally, BCAA accumulation exacerbates impaired mitochondrial respiration and decreases mitochondrial biogenesis in M&#x000fc;ller cells under high glucose conditions. Under disease-related stress, damaged mitochondria accelerate apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction may also deteriorate apoptotic M&#x000fc;ller cells under hyperglycemic conditions. It has been reported that mTORC1 controls mitochondrial activity and biogenesis through 4E-BP-dependent translational regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which suggests that impaired mitochondria in M&#x000fc;ller cells resulting from hyperglycemia and BCAAs may be mediated by mTORC1 activation. Although the three BCAAs are normally consumed together and share similar catabolic processes, most studies have explored the physiological roles of BCAAs in combination rather than individually. Growing evidence suggests that BCAAs may have distinct effects on molecular processes and metabolism and may affect the underlying process of various diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Identifying the predominant BCAA that activates mTORC1 signaling and affects M&#x000fc;ller cells in DR is highly important.</p><p id="Par55">To determine the specific role of individual BCAAs in stimulating the mTORC1 signaling pathway in DR, we used a new high-glucose medium to which each BCAA was individually added. The results showed that BCAA deprivation suppressed the phosphorylation of p70 S6K and S6K in hyperglycemic M&#x000fc;ller cells. However, leucine distinctly increased p-p70 S6K/p70 S6K and p-S6K/S6K in M&#x000fc;ller cells exposed to high glucose without complicated BCAAs. This stimulation was greater than that in the high-glucose medium containing BCAAs. We also observed that isoleucine induced the activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway compared to that in hyperglycemic medium without BCAAs. However, valine did not significantly increase the phosphorylation of the mTORC1 complex. These results suggest that leucine is the main BCAA that induces mTORC1 activation in M&#x000fc;ller cells under DR conditions. The mechanism by which the mTORC1 pathway senses leucine remains debatable. Growing evidence indicates that leucine-binding proteins, such as sestrins, serve as leucine sensors in various facets of organismal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In cultured cells, Sestrin2 suppresses mTORC1 by interacting with and inhibiting the GTPase-activating protein 2 (GATOR2) complex, which positively regulates mTORC1 signaling. Under conditions of abundant leucine, Sestrin2 can bind to it and be released from its complex with GATOR2, thus activating mTORC1 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Another in vivo study showed that leucine-induced activation of mTORC1 in skeletal muscles occurred primarily through the release of Sestrin1 from GATOR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 have been identified as leucine sensors in the mTORC1 pathway in mouse tissues in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In contrast to Sestrin2, LeuRS, an intracellular leucine sensor, initiates mTORC1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. To investigate whether the modulation of mTORC1 by dietary leucine requires Sestrin1 or Sestrin2 and the coordination of sestrins and LeuRS, we generated M&#x000fc;ller cells with knockdown of Sestrin1, Sestrin2, or LeuRS. Under Sestrin2-downregulated conditions, high levels of leucine did not induce the activation of mTORC1 signaling. Although interference with Sestrin1 decreased leucine-induced mTORC1 stimulation, the decrease was not statistically significant. Therefore, in hyperglycemic M&#x000fc;ller cells, leucine activates mTORC1 signaling mainly through Sestrin2 binding. Additionally, LeuRS knockdown significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of p70 S6K and S6K in M&#x000fc;ller cells with the addition of leucine under high glucose conditions. This suggests that Sestrin2 and LeuRS coordinate with each other to regulate mTORC1 signaling in response to leucine in M&#x000fc;ller cells under in vitro DR conditions. Targeting Sestrin2 significantly ameliorated impaired cell viability caused by leucine overload in M&#x000fc;ller cells exposed to high glucose. In the future work, it may be of significance to employ targeting Sestrin2 in vivo in<italic>db/db</italic>mice to explore the protective effects on ameliorating DR development. By vitreous injection of anti- Sestrin2 may be a potential therapy to protect early stage of DR to develop into neovascularization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par56">Our previous work found that elevated levels of BCAAs were observed in vitreous and aqueous humor of patients with DR, which hinted us to further investigate the mechanisms of BCAA accumulation in DR. The present study demonstrated that impaired BCAA catabolism was responsible for BCAA accumulation in the retina and M&#x000fc;ller cells under DR conditions, which was exacerbated by BCAA administration. Leucine was the main BCAA that activated mTORC1 signaling by interacting with Sestrin2 and LeuRS in M&#x000fc;ller cells under high glucose conditions. Future work exploring targeting Sestrin2 to reduce the toxic effects of BCAA accumulation in vivo in <italic>db/db</italic> mice should be addressed. Targeting Sestrin2 may protect M&#x000fc;ller cells during DR development by inhibiting mTORC1 activation and subsequent pathophysiological reactions. These studies would help develop a therapeutic strategy targeting Sestrin2 to protect the early stage of DR and postpone DR development with angiogenesis and neurodegeneration.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BCAAs</term><def><p id="Par5">BranchEd-Chain Amino Acids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BCAT</term><def><p id="Par6">Branched-Chain Aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BCKAs</term><def><p id="Par7">Branched-Chain &#x003b1;-Keto Acids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCK-8</term><def><p id="Par8">Cell Counting Kit-8</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DR</term><def><p id="Par9">Diabetic Retinopathy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DKD</term><def><p id="Par10">Diabetic Kidney Disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GATOR2</term><def><p id="Par11">GTPase-Activating Protein 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IR</term><def><p id="Par12">Insulin Resistance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KIC</term><def><p id="Par13">&#x003b1;-Ketoisovalerate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KIV</term><def><p id="Par14">&#x003b1;-Ketoisobutyrate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KMV</term><def><p id="Par15">&#x003b1;-Keto-&#x003b2;-Methyl Valeric Acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LC&#x02012;MS</term><def><p id="Par16">Liquid Chromatography&#x02012;mass spectrometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LeuRS</term><def><p id="Par17">Leucyl-Trna Synthetase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mTORC1</term><def><p id="Par18">Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OCR</term><def><p id="Par19">Oxygen Consumption Rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>siRNA</term><def><p id="Par20">Small Interfering RNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T2DM</term><def><p id="Par21">Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WT</term><def><p id="Par22">Wild-Type</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by members of the Department of Ophthalmology in Shanghai General Hospital.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Qiaoyun Gong: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft; Jingyi Wang: Data curation, Investigation, Methodology; Dawei Luo: Investigation, Resources, Validation; Yupeng Xu: Resources, Software, Validation; Rulin Zhang: Validation, Software; Xin Li: Methodology; Zihan Yin: Investigation; Junwei Fang: Supervision, Project administration; Haiyan Wang: Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Writing - review &#x00026; editing.</p></notes><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 81870666 and 82101132).</p></notes><notes notes-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></notes><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar1"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p id="Par66">All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai First People&#x02019;s Hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong University.</p></notes><notes id="FPar2"><title>Consent for publication</title><p id="Par67">Not applicable.</p></notes><notes id="FPar3" notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par68">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></notes></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation-alternatives><element-citation id="ec-CR1" publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hammes</surname><given-names>HP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Diabetic retinopathy: hyperglycaemia, oxidative stress and beyond</article-title><source>Diabetologia</source><year>2018</year><volume>61</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>29</fpage><lpage>38</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s00125-017-4435-8</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">28942458</pub-id>
