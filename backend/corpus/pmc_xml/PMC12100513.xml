However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying activation of locomotor networks by ES are unknown. Here, we analyzed the effects of ES on the activity of individual spinal neurons of different functional locomotor groups. Neuronal activity was recorded in decerebrate cats before and during ES that evoked locomotion. During ES initial period (NW-period, before the locomotion onset), the activity was increased in most neurons as compared to that before ES. We found that ES-caused activation of neurons of locomotor network to the average level similar to that observed during locomotion is not sufficient for initiation of locomotion. We demonstrated that the onset of ES-evoked locomotion was associated with specific changes in the activity of individual neurons within functional locomotor groups and in their responses to epidural stimuli. With the locomotion onset, there was a trend for individual neurons with extremely high activity during NW-period to decrease their activity, while for neurons with extremely low activity to become more active. Also, in neurons contributing to generation of a specific mode of locomotion, peaks and troughs in responses to individual epidural stimuli were significantly less pronounced as compared with those observed during NW-period. We suggest that these changes allow ES to maintain the high level of excitability of the locomotor network necessary for its operation without distortion of the locomotor rhythm. The obtained results advance our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying activation of locomotor network by ES.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Epidural stimulation</kwd><kwd>Locomotion</kwd><kwd>Spinal neurons</kwd><kwd>Decerebrate cat</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Locomotion is a vitally important motor function for both animals and humans.

Since ES can evoke locomotion also in subjects with complete transection of the spinal cord (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Gerasimenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Barth&#x000e9;lemy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Courtine et al., 2009</xref>), it was suggested that activated by ES afferents directly activate the spinal locomotor mechanisms. It was hypothesized that activation of afferents leads to gradual building up of neuronal activity in the locomotor network and, when it reaches a certain threshold, generation of locomotion starts (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Grillner and Zangger, 1979</xref>). However, our knowledge about the neuronal mechanisms underlying activation of locomotor networks caused by ES is scarce.</p><p id="P4">EMG responses simultaneously evoked in multiple hindlimb muscles by individual pulses of ES applied with parameters optimal for inducing locomotor movements has been analyzed in subjects with intact and damaged spinal cord (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Gerasimenko et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Lavrov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Musienko et al., 2009</xref>).

It was suggested that Group 1 generates the vertical component of steps (limb elevation and lowering) and when activated alone generates locomotion in place. Group 2 contributes to generation of both the vertical and horizontal (limb transfer from one extreme point to the other along the direction of locomotion) component of forward and backward steps, and Group 3 contains two sub-groups generating horizontal components for forward (Group 3a) and backward (Group 3b) steps (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Musienko et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Here, first, to reveal contributions of different groups of locomotor neuron (Groups 1&#x02013;3) as well as non-locomotor spinal neurons to ES-caused activation of the locomotor networks, the activity of individual neurons from these functional groups before ES and in the initial period of ES (before the onset of locomotion) was compared.

In short, the cats were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (2&#x02013;4 %) delivered in O<sub>2</sub>. The trachea was cannulated, and the carotid arteries were ligated. The animals were decerebrated at the precollicular-postmammillary level. A laminectomy was performed between the L4 and L7 segments for ES and recording of neurons. Bipolar electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were implanted bilaterally into <italic toggle="yes">m. gastrocnemius lateralis</italic> (Gast, ankle extensor) and <italic toggle="yes">m. tibialis anterior</italic> (Tib, ankle flexor).

In short, the head, the vertebral column, and the pelvis of the decerebrate cat were fixed in a rigid frame. The forelimbs had no support, whereas the hindlimbs were positioned on the treadmill belt moving at the speed of 0.5 m/s either backward or forward in relation to the animal.</p><p id="P13">In each cat, locomotion was evoked by electrical epidural stimulation (ES) of the spinal cord. For this purpose, a ball electrode (d = 0.5 mm) was positioned on the dura mater close to the middle of the dorsal surface of the spinal cord at the L5-L6 level. The exact medio-lateral and rostro-caudal position was optimized to produce the highest quality of the locomotor movements in terms of stability, intra-limb coordination, and inter-limb symmetry. The following parameters of stimulation were used: biphasic square pulses; frequency, 5 Hz; pulse duration, 0.2&#x02013;0.5 ms; current, 100&#x02013;300 &#x003bc;A (Model 2100 Isolated Pulse Stimulator, A-M Systems, Sequim, WA, USA). Spinal neurons were recorded extracellularly from the spinal segment L4-L6 by means of commercially available multichannel electrode arrays (A1x32-10 mm-50-177; Neuronexus, Ann Arbor, MI). The array was inserted through small holes in the dura mater. The holes were made along the left-right extent of the gray matter. Within a hole, at the point of the insertion of the array, a small incision in the pia mater was made just sufficient for the spinal cord penetration. The array was inserted between blood vessels to prevent bleeding. We attempted to explore systematically the whole cross-section of gray matter except for the areas of motor nuclei. However, histological verification of the array track positions showed that while in L4 and L6 segments the array tracks positions covered the whole cross-section of the gray matter, in L5 spinal segment, all array tracks were located in the medial part of the gray matter.</p><p id="P14">We used only those neurons from the database obtained in our previous study (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Musienko et al., 2022</xref>) that were recorded during the following procedure: first, backward motion of the treadmill belt was switched on (TM-period), then ES was switched on and evoked forward walking on the backward moving treadmill belt (FW-period), and, finally, the direction of the treadmill belt motion was reversed that led to backward walking (BW-period). The onset of ES did not result in immediate initiation of coordinated stepping. The period between the ES onset to the moment of generation of the first left-right alternating steps was defined as the period of &#x0201c;non-walking&#x0201d; (NW-period). Parameters of ES were chosen to be optimal for induction of locomotion and were not changed during recording. The neurons were recorded along with the EMG activity of hindlimb muscles and the anterior-posterior locomotor limb movements (recorded by means of two mechanical sensors; Limb R and Limb L in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To determine the approximate location of individual neurons (recorded at a definite position of the array by a particular electrode site) on the spinal cord cross-section, the lateral and vertical coordinates of the array tip were marked. The positions of the array in the spinal cord were verified by observation of the array tracks after histological procedure (see <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Musienko et al., 2022</xref> for details). The positions of the recording sites were estimated in relation to the array track position.</p><p id="P16">The signals from the electrode array (neuronal activity), EMG electrodes, mechanical sensors were amplified and digitized with a sampling frequency of 24 kHz (neurons), 20 kHz (EMGs), and 5 kHz (sensors). Neuronal activity was band-pass filtered in the ranges 2.2&#x02013;7500 Hz (Medusa preamplifiers, Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, Florida, USA) and 300&#x02013;6000 Hz (digital), EMGs were filtered only on the amplifier stage in the range 100&#x02013;5000 Hz (Model 1700 Differential AC Amplifier, A-M Systems, Sequim, WA, USA). These signals, together with the signals indicating the switching-on and switching-off of the treadmill and ES, were recorded on a computer disk using the data acquisition system (RZ5 BioAmp Processor, Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, Florida, USA).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>2.4.</label><title>Data analysis</title><p id="P17">The multiunit spike trains recorded by each electrode were separated into unitary waveforms representing the activity of individual neurons using the spike-sorting procedure in analysis software (Spike2, Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK) (see <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Musienko et al., 2022</xref> for details). An example of activity of seven neurons simultaneously recorded during backward treadmill motion in the absence of ES (&#x0201c;treadmill period&#x0201d;, TM-period) and during the initial period of ES that is before generation of the first alternating steps performed by the left and right hindlimbs (&#x0201c;no-walk period&#x0201d;, NW-period), during forward and backward walking (FW- and BW-period, respectively), as well as waveforms of their spikes are shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">A</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">C</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, respectively. The activity of the neurons was typically modulated with the locomotor rhythm (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). As in our previous work (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Musienko et al., 2022</xref>), the activity of a neuron was considered modulated if two necessary criteria were met: first, the mean burst frequency was significantly different from the mean interburst frequency (Student&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and, second, the pattern of modulation in the majority of the locomotor cycles was consistent (the Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient between the profiles of activity in individual locomotor cycles and in the entire activity histogram was higher than 0.3 in more than 60 % of the locomotor cycles).</p><p id="P18">To reveal reaction of individual neurons to beginning of ES as well as a change in their activity caused by ES-evoked FW and BW, the mean frequencies of individual neurons during TM-, NW-, FW-, and BW-period were calculated.</p><p id="P19">To reveal responses in a hindlimb muscle to single epidural stimuli (mES-responses), its EMG was rectified and smoothed by moving average filters with a time constant of 50 ms, then the ES stimuli were used as triggers to average the processed EMG. Such ES-triggered averages were built separately for NW-, FW-, and BW-period.</p><p id="P20">To reveal responses of a neuron to single epidural stimuli (ES-responses), a post-stimulus histogram (PStH) with 200 ms duration and bin size 1 ms was generated. The number of spikes that fell in each bin was divided by the bin duration and by the number of stimuli, to produce the spiking frequency. The respective rasters and histograms for two neurons are shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">J</xref>. The high-frequency &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; in PStHs was reduced by filtering with a Gaussian kernel. The filtered PStHs are shown in skyline mode by gray lines in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">J</xref>. The time constant (<italic toggle="yes">T</italic>) for the filtering was different for different bins: it was linearly dependent on the bin latency (<italic toggle="yes">L</italic>) (<italic toggle="yes">T</italic> = 0.05 * <italic toggle="yes">L</italic> + 2), thus for the 1st bin <italic toggle="yes">T</italic> was 2 ms, for the 200th (the last) bin <italic toggle="yes">T</italic> was 12 ms, and for the other bins <italic toggle="yes">T</italic> was between 2 and 12 ms. Such choice of the time constant allowed to preserve high time resolution for short-latency responses (though the random noise remained relatively high) and to suppress the noise in the long-latency responses (at the cost of time resolution). For each neuron, PStHs (ES-responses) for NW-, FW-, and BW-period were built separately.</p><p id="P21">To evaluate the degree of similarity between patterns of ES-responses of the same neuron at transition from NW- to FW-period and from FW- to BW-period, we calculated the coefficient of similarity (<italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sub>SIM</sub>) that is the cosine similarity between a pair of histograms with subtracted background (the average frequency during the last 25 ms of the PStH) obtained in the corresponding conditions. Such analysis reveals covariations of the two functions, i.e., parallel changes of the instantaneous discharge frequency during the response, while dismissing differences in mean frequencies and depths of frequency change. So defined coefficient of similarity varies in a range from &#x02212;1 (completely opposite changes of activity, e.g. excitation in one PStH and simultaneous inhibition of the same shape in the other PStH) to +1 (completely synchronous changes of activity in all aspects, that is latencies, shapes and durations). Examples of ES-responses of individual neurons recorded under three conditions and then compared using this method are shown in <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">D</xref>.</p><p id="P22">To reveal typical components of ES-responses, non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) of ES-response were computed using Scikit-learn data analysis package (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>). We considered 6 NNMF components, which were the minimal number of components sufficient to account on average for 95 % of ES-response shapes. Amplitudes of NNMF components were normalized so that a flat PStH with a constant firing frequency at 1 Hz would produce NNMF&#x02019;s weighting coefficients of 1.

Most likely, it can be explained by a higher level of excitability of flexor motoneurons caused by activation of flexors&#x02019; stretch receptor afferents due to limb extension produced by treadmill belt motion. The later component was less consistent (e.g., in Tib L, it was absent in response to epidural stimuli #1, #3, and #5; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) and more consistently expressed in flexors than in extensors (e.g., it was absent in Gast R; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The amplitude of both earlier and later responses fluctuated independently. Thus, in Gast L, the earlier component of the mES-response to epidural stimulus #3 was large, but the later component was absent, while the earlier component of the mES-response to epidural stimulus #4 was small but the later response was present.

Type 3 ES-patterns were characterized by sequential waves of excitation started in individual neurons with different latencies up to ~50 ms. Types 4 and 5 ES-patterns were characterized by long lasting excitation that continues until the next epidural stimuli. In Type 5, the excitation was preceded by inhibitory response, while in Type 4 it was preceded by activity which did not differ from activity in TM-period. However, since in neurons with Type 4 ES-patterns the excitation continued until the next ES stimulus, one can expect that the return to the level of activity in TM-period observed just after ES stimulus is also caused by the inhibition.

The results are presented in <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">F</xref>).</p><p id="P45">In general, in all groups of neurons during NW-period the profile of ES-response was characterized by high earlier activity (components ##1&#x02013;3 were above 1) and weaker later activity in the second half of the response (components ##5,6 were below 1). In Groups 1 and 2 (that contribute to control of both FW and BW), amplitudes of the components which were above 1 during NW-period decreased during both FW and BW, while those that were below 1 during NW-period increased (significant changes with transition from NW-period to FW and BW are marked, respectively, by red and blue asterisks in <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). As a result, the significant (although rather small) difference from 1 remained only for component #2 in Groups 1 and 2 during FW as well as for component #4 in Group 1 during BW (indicated by diamonds in <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>,<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Thus, due to a decrease in earlier activity (components ##1&#x02013;4) and an increase in later activity (component #6), on average, the profiles of ES-responses in Groups 1 and 2 during locomotion became flat (all components of the ES-response were close to the average activity level). In the following text, such changes are termed as &#x0201c;flattening&#x0201d; of ES-response.</p><p id="P46">In Groups 3a and 3b (that contribute, respectively, to control of FW only and BW only) flattening of ES-response was observed only during the locomotor behavior to which the corresponding Group contributed. Thus, in Group 3a, only during FW all averaged components of ES-response changed toward 1 (nevertheless, component #2 remained significantly above 1 and component #6 remained slightly but significantly below 1; <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>), while in Group 3b similar changes were observed only during BW (all differences of the component averages from 1 were insignificant; <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E</xref>). Note that during the locomotor behavior to which the Groups 3a and 3b do not contribute, the profiles of ES-responses were similar to those observed during NW-period and retained their high peaks of earlier activity and weaker later activity. Thus, in Group 3a, components ##1,2 were above and components ##4,5,6 were below 1 during BW (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>), while in Group 3b, components ##1,2,3 were above and components ##4,5,6 were below 1 during FW (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E</xref>).</p><p id="P47">Finally, in non-modulated neurons, the profiles of ES-responses during both FW and BW were similar to those observed during NW-period (components ##1,2 were significantly above and component #6 was significantly below 1; <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9F</xref>). Thus, in non-modulated neurons, the flattening of ES-response during both FW and BW was absent.</p><p id="P48">We also found that in Groups 1 and 2, a significant (often severalfold) decrease in SD values of normalized amplitudes of components ##1&#x02013;6 was observed during FW- and BW-period (except for component #3 of Group 2) as compared with those during NW-period (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>,<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). By contrast, in Groups 3a and 3b, a significant decrease in SD value of most components was observed only during the locomotor behavior to which the corresponding Group contributed.

Finally, in non-modulated neurons (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10E</xref>), in some components the value of SD increased (in component #1 during BW-period) and in some components it significantly decreased during locomotion (in component 2 during both FW- and BW-period) as compared with that in NW-period. Thus, in locomotor Groups of neurons, the variability of amplitudes of different components of ES response as compared with those in NW-period was significantly decreased during the type of locomotion to which generation the Group contributed.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S18"><label>4.</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P49">In the present study, to reveal effects of ES on the activity of spinal neurons that lead to initiation of locomotion, we compared: (i) the activity of individual neurons at three conditions - in the absence of ES (TM-period), in the initial period of ES (before the first reciprocally coordinated left-right steps were generated, NW-period), and during well-coordinated FW/BW (FW/BW-period); (ii) responses of neurons to individual epidural stimuli (ES-responses) during NW-, FW-, and BW-period. The comparison was done for different functional groups of neurons (locomotor Group 1&#x02013;3 neurons and non-modulated neurons) as well as for neurons located in the stimulated segment (L5), in segments rostral (L4), and caudal (L6) to stimulation.</p><sec id="S19"><label>4.1.</label><title>Beginning of locomotion is associated with specific changes in activity of individual locomotor neurons rather than with changes in their population activity level</title><p id="P50">ES activates locomotor mechanisms through large-diameter myelinated sensory fibers of dorsal roots (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Gerasimenko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Capogrosso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Moraud et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Formento et al., 2018</xref>). It was hypothesized that to start locomotion, the activity level of locomotor neurons must be above some necessary minimum. It was suggested that stimulation of sensory afferents leads to gradual building up of neuronal activity and when the activity exceeds the required level, the generation of locomotion begins (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Grillner and Zangger, 1979</xref>).</p><p id="P51">Indeed, we found that in each of L4-L6 segments, as well as in each of Groups of locomotor neurons and in non-locomotor neurons, ES strongly activated the overwhelming majority of neurons during NW-period. Since after entering the spinal cord, afferents of dorsal roots bifurcate into ascending and descending branches that send terminals to multiple spinal segments (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Edgley and Jankowska, 1987a</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Mense and Craig, 1988</xref>), it is not surprising that ES similarly affects neurons located in stimulated as well as neighboring segments. Although the large-diameter afferents activate both excitatory and inhibitory neurons (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Edgley and Jankowska, 1987b</xref>; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Bannatyne et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Jankowska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Jankowska and Edgley, 2010</xref>), our results demonstrate that the &#x0201c;net effect&#x0201d; of their activation is excitatory.</p><p id="P52">We expected that the average activity of neurons (and in particular, locomotor neurons) would be lower during gradual building up of neuronal activity in NW-period as compared to that in FW/BW-periods. Surprisingly, we found that transition from NW-period to FW/BW was not accompanied either by substantial changes in the mean frequency of neuronal populations located in each of L4-L6 segments, or by specific changes in the mean frequency of different locomotor Groups and in non-locomotor neurons. Thus, ES-caused activation of the neurons of the locomotor network to an average level similar to that observed during locomotion is not sufficient for initiation of stable locomotor rhythm generation.</p><p id="P53">However, we found a significant trend in the activity change of individual neurons within functional groups with transition from NW- to FW/BW-period: those neurons that were less active during NW-period tended to increase their activity, while those neurons that were more active during NW-period tended to decrease their activity during locomotion. Thus, generation of stable locomotion is associated with a decrease in heterogenety in the activity level of individual neurons and therefore narrowing the range of individual neurons activity. One can suppose that the neurons with insufficiently high or excessively high activity during NW-period may hamper initiation of locomotor rhythm generation.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><label>4.2.</label><title>Beginning of locomotion is associated with flattening of responses of locomotor neurons to individual ES stimuli</title><p id="P54">According to their pattern, six Types of ES-responses during NW-period were revealed. Only in 29 % of neurons a sharp excitatory response was observed (Types 1 and 2). Most likely, a part of these responses with shortest latencies were monosynaptic. It was demonstrated that Group 1 afferents monosynaptically affect both excitatory and inhibitory neurons (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Edgley and Jankowska, 1987b</xref>; <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Bannatyne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Jankowska et al., 2009</xref>). Surprisingly, in almost half of neurons (44 %), the earlier component of the ES-response was inhibitory. One can suppose that some neurons with Types 1 and 2 responses are inhibitory and cause this earlier inhibitory component. ES-responses in most neurons were characterized by sequential waves of excitation (Types 3&#x02013;5) or inhibition (Type 6). Most likely these waves of excitation/inhibition reflect activation of polysynaptic reverberating circuits. It was suggested earlier that activation of polysynaptic spinal circuities is necessary for activation of locomotor networks by ES (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Gerasimenko et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P55">We found that the patterns of ES-responses during FW-period substantially differed from those during NW-period (<italic toggle="yes">K<sub>SIM</sub></italic> ~ 40&#x02013;45 %) both in locomotor (Groups 1&#x02013;3) and in non-modulated neurons. The difference can be caused either by inputs from other neurons of the activated locomotor network or by substantial changes (gating) in the pathways transmitting signals from activated by ES afferents to neurons taking place with the onset of locomotion. Gating of sensory inputs from specific afferents to spinal neurons with the onset of locomotion was demonstrated earlier (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Duysens and Pearson, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Conway et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Shefchyk et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Gossard et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Quevedo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">McCrea, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Angel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Musienko et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). We also found that in Group 1 and Group 2 neurons (that contribute to generation of both FW and BW) the difference in patterns of ES-responses with transition from FW to BW was significantly smaller (<italic toggle="yes">K<sub>SIM</sub></italic> ~ 60&#x02013;65 %) as compared to that observed with transition from NW-period to FW. One can suggest that gating of ES-responses in Group 1 and Group 2 neurons is produced by the rhythm generating part of the locomotor network that operates similarly during both FW and BW and generates the vertical component of the step (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Musienko et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). By contrast, in Group 3a and Group 3b neurons (contributing to generation of FW only and BW only, respectively) as well as in non-modulated neurons, the changes in the pattern of ES-response with transition from FW to BW were similar to those observed with transition from NW-period to FW. Most likely, gating of ES-responses in these functional groups is caused by different parts of locomotor network that operate during FW only and BW only and control the horizontal component of the FW and BW step, respectively (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Musienko et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p><p id="P56">It is well documented that sensory feedback from the limbs transmitted by group 1a and 1b afferents assists in swing/stance transition, and their stimulation in an inappropriate part of the locomotor cycle can disrupt/reset/entrain the locomotor rhythm (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Grillner and Rossignol, 1978</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Duysens and Pearson, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Hiebert et al., 1996</xref>). One of the striking features of ES is that epidural stimuli that strongly activate these afferents do not disrupt/reset/entrain the locomotor rhythm. We demonstrated that with the onset of locomotion, the ES-responses in locomotor neurons which contribute to generation of particular mode of locomotion (FW or BW) became flatter (due to a decrease in high amplitude components and increase in low amplitude components of the ES-response, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11A</xref>), as well as their variability decreased. Thus, most likely the absence of strong sharp components in ES-responses of locomotor neurons during locomotion explains the fact that ES does not entrain/disrupt/reset the locomotor rhythm. In line with this, in neurons not involved in generation of stepping (non-locomotor neurons, and also Group 3a during BW and Group 3b during FW) flattening and decrease in variability of ES-responses were absent.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><label>4.3.</label><title>Hypothesis about mechanism underlying induction of locomotion by ES</title><p id="P57">Results obtained in the present study are summarized in <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">E</xref>. We found that while before ES the activity of locomotor neurons was very weak or absent (indicated by gray background in <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11B</xref>), most locomotor neurons were activated during NW-period (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11C</xref>). Although the mean level of the activity of population of locomotor network neurons was similar to that observed during locomotion (indicated by yellow background in <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11C</xref>,<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), the activities of individual locomotor neurons as well as their ES-responses significantly differed from those observed during locomotion. The heterogeneity in the activity level of individual locomotor neurons was very large (indicated by different colors outline of neuronal cell bodies in <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11C</xref>), and ES-responses in many neurons were characterized by high peaks and deep troughs (indicated by purple/blue fill of neuronal cell bodies in <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11C</xref>). One can assume that these factors hampered the necessary coordination of locomotor neurons required for generation of the locomotor pattern. Instead, mES-responses (responses in muscles to single ES stimuli) with more consistent earlier [presumably monosynaptic (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Gerasimenko et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Lavrov et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Musienko et al., 2009</xref>)] and less consistent later (polysynaptic) components were observed. Stronger mES-responses in flexor muscles as compared with those in extensor ones can be explained by a higher level of excitability of flexor motoneurons caused by activation of flexor stretch receptor afferents due to extension of limbs during NW-period caused by treadmill belt motion.</p><p id="P58">We found that transition from NW- to FW/BW-period was associated with an increase and decrease in activity of individual locomotor neurons with low and high activity, respectively, as well as with flattening and a decrease in variability of their ES-responses (indicated by homogeneous fill of neuronal cell bodies in <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11D</xref>,<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). The mechanisms underlying these changes are not clear. It was suggested that activation of polysynaptic pathways underlying appearance of the later component of ES-response is necessary for initiation of ES-caused locomotion (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Gerasimenko et al., 2008</xref>). One can assume that these activated by ES polysynaptic pathways include Group 1 interneurons (presumably forming swing and stance half-centers, respectively, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Musienko et al., 2022</xref>) and long-latency components of ES responses (e.g., components ##5,6) of some of these Group 1 neurons are responsible for generation of the later component of the mES-responses (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11C</xref>). Most probably during NW-period, within each of the half-centers, a part of activated Group 1 neurons (that had activity in the locomotor range and flat ES-responses, indicated by red in <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11C</xref>) were recruited into rhythm generation. These small rhythm generating networks started to gate pathways mediating ES-responses of other locomotor neurons. This gating resulted in a change of their general activity toward the locomotor range and flattening of the ES-responses. That caused gradual recruitment of these neurons into rhythm generation, finally leading to coordinated activity of the two half-centers and generation of locomotor movements. Alternating activity in swing and stance half-centers during locomotion led to phase-dependent modulation of earlier component of mES-response (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11D</xref>,<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">E</xref>).</p><p id="P59">To conclude, in the present study, for the first time, effects of ES on the activity of individual spinal neurons during the initial period of ES as well as during well-coordinated FW and BW were analyzed. We demonstrated that the onset of ES causes activation of the overwhelming majority of spinal neurons. Although on the population level the activity of spinal neurons in the initial period of ES and during FW/BW was similar, the activity of individual neurons within each functional population as well as their responses to individual epidural stimuli at these two conditions were substantially different. With the onset of a specific mode of locomotion (FW or BW) the range of activities of individual neurons contributing to its generation was narrowed, as well as ES-responses of individual neurons were significantly flattened. We suggest that these changes allow to maintain a high level of excitability of locomotor network without distortion of the locomotor rhythm. The obtained results provide new insights into neuronal mechanism underlying activation of locomotor network by ES.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P60">This work was supported by the St. Petersburg State University, St. Petersburg, Russia (projects: 104623591, 129660474) (for development of experimental setup) to PEM; by grant from NIH (R01 NS-100928) to TGD and PEM; by grant from NIH (R01 NS-064964) to TGD; by grant from Swedish Research Council (2020-02502) to TGD; by the Russian Science Foundation grant 22-15-00092 (for OVG) to PEM; by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (Agreement 075-10-2021-093) (for PYS) to PEM; by the State funding of the Pavlov Institute of Physiology, Russian Academy of Sciences (N-124020100105-6) (for development of recording system) to PEM.

A. Schematic changes in ES-responses with transition from NW-period (dashed purple/blue line) to FW-/BW-period (red line). B-E. Hypothetical spinal circuitry affected by ES is shown in three conditions: during TM-period (B), during NW-period (C), as well as during FW/BW-period when it generates swing (D) and stance (E) phases of the locomotor cycle. In each condition, effects produced by the network on the activity of flexor and extensor muscles (EMG Fl and EMG Ex) are shown schematically. Gray background indicates a condition in which the average activity of locomotor neurons is low, while yellow background indicates a condition in which the average activity of locomotor neurons is similar to that observed during locomotion. Designations: neurons within circles belong to flexor and extensor half-centers of the locomotor network (Fl and Ex, respectively). The neurons outside the circles are motoneurons. Open triangles show excitatory synapses, filled circles &#x02013; inhibitory synapses. Inactive neurons, neurons with very weak and with extremely high activity (which are out of the locomotor range) are indicated, respectively, by blue, pink, and purple outline as well as their connections are marked by blue, pink and purple, respectively. Neurons with large amplitude peaks and troughs in ES-responses are indicated by purple/blue filled circles and their connections are indicated by dashed (purple/blue) lines. Neurons with activity within the locomotor range and flat ES-responses as well as their connections are indicated by red. In C, higher level of excitability of flexor motoneurons and lower level of excitability of extensor motoneurons are marked by red and blue outline, respectively. See explanations in the text.
