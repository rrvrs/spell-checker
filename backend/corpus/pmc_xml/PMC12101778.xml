</self-uri><abstract><p>Central trained immunity, induced via reprogramming of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), mediates sustained heightened responsiveness of mature myeloid cells to secondary challenges. We have previously demonstrated that HSPCs use TLR2 and Dectin-1 to sense <italic toggle="yes">Candida albicans</italic> to induce the production of trained monocytes/macrophages to fight against secondary infection. Neutrophils play an important role in innate immunity and are critical for clearance of <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans.</italic> In this work, we used an <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> model of mouse HSPC differentiation to investigate the functional phenotype of neutrophils derived from HSPCs exposed to various PAMPs and <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> cells. We found that neutrophils derived from HSPCs stimulated by a TLR2 agonist exhibit reduced inflammatory cytokine production (tolerized neutrophils) whereas neutrophils generated from a Dectin-1 agonist or <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> stimulated HSPCs produce higher amounts of cytokines (trained neutrophils). We further demonstrated that a transient exposure of HSPCs to live <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> cells is sufficient to induce a trained phenotype of the neutrophils they produce in a Dectin-1- and TLR2-dependent manner. These trained neutrophils exhibited higher phagocytosis and microbicidal capacity than control neutrophils. Additionally, their adoptive transfer was sufficient to reduce fungal burden during invasive candidiasis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that trained neutrophils use mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) to enhance their ability to kill <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> cells, as they produce higher amounts of mtROS and scavenging mtROS with MitoTEMPO attenuated their yeast-killing ability to match that of control neutrophils. Altogether, these data suggest that infection-experienced HSPCs contribute to trained immunity by providing a source of trained neutrophils with enhanced antimicrobial activity which may confer prolonged protection from infection. The tailored manipulation of this mechanism might offer new therapeutic strategies for controlling fungal infections by harnessing neutrophils.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Invasive candidiasis is an increasingly frequent cause of serious and often fatal infection. Understanding host defense is essential to design novel therapeutic strategies to boost immune protection against <italic toggle="yes">Candida albicans</italic>. Neutrophils are innate immune cells that are crucial for controlling <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> infection. In this work, we delve into new concepts that have arisen over the last years: (i) trained innate immunity extends to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), a process called central trained immunity and (ii) neutrophils may contribute to the protective effects of trained immunity, as already described for monocytes and macrophages. We demonstrate that <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-stimulated HSPCs generate trained neutrophils with an increased cytokine production, as well as with an improved ability to internalize and kill yeast cells. Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of trained neutrophils defends mice against infection. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that trained neutrophils use mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) to enhance their ability to kill <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> cells. Taken together, these data indicate that HSPCs can sense pathogens during infection and contribute to protect the host by generating trained neutrophils. Targeting this mechanism may provide a therapeutic strategy to boost neutrophil function and treat or prevent infectious diseases.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Systemic candidiasis is an increasingly frequent cause of life-threatening infections in hospitalized and immunosuppressed patients. Phagocytes, such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells are crucial for host defence against invasive candidiasis. During infection, these myeloid cells can detect the microorganism by using several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including different members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and C-type lectin receptor (CLR) families. They are responsible for releasing proinflammatory cytokines to recruit and activate other leukocytes, as well as for microbial killing and antigen processing and presentation to initiate the adaptive immune response [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Immune memory is not an exclusive feature of adaptive immunity; innate immune cells can also display some memory characteristics and respond in a different way upon re-exposure to the same or heterologous stimuli. For instance, exposure of monocytes and macrophages to <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> enhanced their subsequent inflammatory response to stimulation (trained immunity), while TLR2 and TLR4 ligands confer a reduced response to macrophages (tolerance). The mechanisms leading to this functional reprogramming of cells include metabolic changes and epigenetic remodelling [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>This concept of innate immune memory extends beyond short-lived mature myeloid cells to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), explaining the described long-term memory [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this context, we have demonstrated that HSPCs exposed to a TLR2 ligand or Dectin-1 agonists produce soluble factors that act in a paracrine manner on unexposed HSPCs, leading to the generation of tolerized or trained macrophages respectively [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Trained immunity may be beneficial for the host as it confers protection to secondary infection. It has been described in several models that trained monocytes/macrophages protect against heterologous infections, including candidiasis [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the potential role of trained neutrophils in protection during candidiasis remains unexplored, despite the essential role of this cell type in protection against <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> infection. Neutrophils are the first cells to be recruited to the site of infection and are the most effective killers of <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>. In fact, neutropenia is a major risk factor for invasive candidiasis [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Although neutrophils were considered to be a homogeneous population unable to adapt to changing environments, recent evidence indicates that neutrophils are heterogeneous and can respond to environmental changes with significantly altered gene expression. Trained neutrophils have been previously described in some models [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In fact, pre-treatment of mice with &#x003b2;-glucan resulted in a tumour growth reduction, which was associated with transcriptomic and epigenetic rewiring of granulocyte progenitors and the generation of trained neutrophils [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, BCG vaccination in humans induced trained immunity in neutrophils, characterized by increased expression of activation markers, and greater responsiveness to heterologous stimulation [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Lastly, neutrophils and monocytes had enhanced anti-microbial activity, and mice were protected from listeriosis nine weeks after induction of training with &#x003b2;-glucan [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that PRR signalling in HSPCs determines the antifungal phenotype of the neutrophils they produce. A transient exposure of HSPCs to live <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> cells, prior to differentiation, is sufficient to induce a trained phenotype to the differentiated neutrophils in a Dectin-1 and TLR2-dependent manner. Our work shows that trained neutrophils exhibit an increased cytokine production, as well as an improved ability to kill microorganisms. Moreover, the adoptive transfer of trained neutrophils is sufficient to reduce fungal burden during invasive candidiasis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that trained neutrophils use mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) to enhance their ability to kill <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> cells. Taken together, these data indicate that HSPCs can sense pathogens during infection and contribute to protect the host by generating trained neutrophils that produce higher levels of cytokines and use mtROS for their enhanced fungicidal activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Exposure of HSPCs to TLR2 and Dectin-1 agonists modulates cytokine production by the neutrophils they produce</title><p>For <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> HSPC differentiation to neutrophils, lineage negative (Lin<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) cells were cultured with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and IL-3.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the increased fungicidal activity of trained neutrophils derived from <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> treated HSPCs might be conferred by an increased ROS production by the NADPH oxidase system. However, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) which specifically inhibits ROS production by the NADPH oxidase did not blunt neither the ability of neutrophils to kill <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> nor the increased fungicidal activity of trained neutrophils (<xref rid="ppat.1013170.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Historically, ROS production in neutrophils has been associated with NADPH oxidase, but recent work in human and mouse neutrophils suggested that mitochondria generated ROS (mtROS) enhances their bactericidal activity [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To determine if mtROS were involved in the fungicidal activity, neutrophils were treated with MitoTEMPO, a mitochondria-specific superoxide scavenger, prior to yeasts exposure. We found that treatment with mitoTEMPO decreased the fungicidal activity of trained neutrophils to match that of control neutrophils (<xref rid="ppat.1013170.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). As complexes I and III are the primary sources of mitochondria-derived ROS [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] we also tested the effect of Antimycin A, an inhibitor of Complex III, and found that Antimycin A had the same impact on <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> killing by trained neutrophils than mitoTEMPO, suggesting that the mtROS are originated from Complex III (<xref rid="ppat.1013170.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). To confirm these results, we directly measured mtROS using a flow cytometry-based assay using MitoSOX, a dye that specifically targets the mitochondria and fluoresces when it is oxidized by superoxide (<xref rid="ppat.1013170.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1013170.g005" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). Neutrophils were treated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) to simulate oxidative stress, and an increased mtROS production was detected by trained neutrophils (higher % of MitoSOX<sup>+</sup> neutrophils and higher MFI of total cells) (<xref rid="ppat.1013170.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). To confirm that this method in fact detects ROS produced by the mitochondria, we added MitoTEMPO or Antimycin A before TBHP stimulation. We found that both inhibitors abolished the higher MitoSOX MFI detected in trained neutrophils in comparison with control neutrophils, confirming the specificity of the MitoSOX method (<xref rid="ppat.1013170.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E Fig</xref>). Finally, we measured mtROS in response to live GFP-<italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> cells, and we determined whether mtROS production required neutrophil phagocytosis of yeasts. We detected an increased mtROS production in both trained neutrophils directly interacting with yeasts (GFP<sup>+</sup>), and those that had non-internalized yeasts (GFP<sup>&#x02013;</sup>), suggesting that mtROS are produced during infection independently of yeast contact (<xref rid="ppat.1013170.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we investigated whether the ability to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contributed to the enhanced killing capacity of trained neutrophils. We found that trained neutrophils showed an increase in NET formation in response to both, the known NET-inducing agent PMA and <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> cells, compared to control neutrophils (<xref rid="ppat.1013170.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1F Fig</xref>).

However, there is recent evidence that neutrophils also play important roles upon training [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, trained immunity does not only occur in mature myeloid cells within peripheral tissues but may in fact be initiated in their progenitors within the bone marrow (central trained immunity). HSPCs express PRRs, as well as receptors for cytokines and growth factors enabling them to recognize and respond to infections, boosting the production of myeloid cells by a process named emergency myelopoiesis [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this context, our group has demonstrated that exposure of HSPCs to <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> results in the production of trained macrophages with a greater capacity to produce cytokines [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we induced neutrophil differentiation from HSPCs <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> by using cytokines produced by the host specially during infection and inflammatory conditions (IL-3 and G-CSF). We then assessed whether PRR signalling on HSPCs modulates cytokine production by the neutrophils they produce. Our findings revealed that neutrophils generated from HSPCs exposed to a TLR2 agonist produce lower levels of inflammatory cytokines (tolerized neutrophils). In contrast, exposure to a Dectin-1 agonist results in the opposite phenotype, increased cytokine production (trained neutrophils). <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> yeasts, which signal via both receptors, induce higher cytokine production, indicating that combinatorial signalling by multiple receptors on HSPCs shapes their downstream immune responses. In fact, the production of TNF-&#x003b1; is enhanced in neutrophils generated from HSPCs exposed simultaneously to both Pam<sub>3</sub>CSK<sub>4</sub> and depleted-zymosan compared to control neutrophils (<xref rid="ppat.1013170.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1G Fig</xref>). These results align with previous reports showing similar phenotypes by <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> differentiated macrophages: tolerized macrophages from HSPCs exposed to Pam<sub>3</sub>CSK<sub>4</sub> and trained macrophages from HSPCs exposed to depleted zymosan or <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> yeasts [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, HSPCs can be reprogrammed to produce tolerized or trained neutrophils, probably through metabolic changes and epigenetic remodelling as described in a few models for trained neutrophils. Importantly, neutrophils from BCG-vaccinated individuals present several hallmarks of trained immunity, including both epigenetic and metabolic changes [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>To further investigate this issue, we assessed whether <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> signalling on HSPCs modulates other important anti-fungal functions of neutrophils, such as phagocytosis and killing of yeasts. We found that transient exposure of HSPCs to live yeasts, but not to inactivated yeasts, confers a higher ability to internalize and kill <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> cells to the neutrophils they produce in a Dectin-1 and TLR2-dependent manner. The use of live yeasts, which can express several virulence factors, more closely resembles the conditions under which HSPCs encounter yeasts during real infection, once the fungus reaches the bone marrow [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] or when HSPCs are mobilized to the site of infection, as it has been described in several infection models including candidiasis [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this context, it was reported that intestinal colonization by <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> promotes granulopoiesis and protection against Gram-positive bacterial infection mediated by neutrophils. Interestingly, candidalysin-deficient mutant strains lost the ability to induce granulopoiesis and to protect mice against infection, highlighting the essential role of the hypha-associated virulence factor candidalysin in this model of trained neutrophils [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interestingly, exposure of progenitors to live <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> cells enhances the microbicidal activity of the neutrophils derived from them, as these neutrophils have an improved ability to kill cells of <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">C. glabrata</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>. This enhanced antimicrobial function might contribute to the observed nonspecific protective effects in different models of trained immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>To explore the biological relevance of this mechanism, we used a model of HSPC transplantation to investigate their possible differentiation to trained neutrophils <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. Purified Lin<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells from DsRed mice were <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> stimulated with live yeasts and adoptively transferred to HSPC-depleted mice. Remarkably, under these <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> conditions, we found that proinflammatory cytokine production is enhanced in DsRed neutrophils originated from <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-stimulated HSPCs, but is not altered in DsRed neutrophils differentiated from unstimulated HSPCs or in neutrophils from recipient mice.</p><p>Going deeper, we have directly demonstrated the biological relevance of trained neutrophils in mediating resistance to infection <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. The adoptive transfer of neutrophils, generated <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> from <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-stimulated HSPCs, reduced the fungal burden in mice depleted of their own neutrophils during invasive candidiasis. While these differences in fungal burden support the notion that trained neutrophils provide protection against invasive candidiasis, a survival study would provide more definitive evidence of their role in protection. However, these experiments are technically challenging, as mice depleted of neutrophils are extremely susceptible to candidiasis, and by two days post-depletion, when the infection and adoptive transfer of trained neutrophils are performed, mice start producing their own neutrophils, potentially masking the effects of the transplanted neutrophils. Nevertheless, this result is in accordance with the improved ability to internalize and kill yeast cells of trained neutrophils generated <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, and with a previous report showing that &#x003b2;-glucan-induced training increases the antimicrobial activity of neutrophils, conferring prolonged protection against listeriosis [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Future studies should address the possibility of therapeutically administered trained neutrophils as a strategy to counteract the adverse effects of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.</p><p>In this context, it has been described that immunization with different <italic toggle="yes">Candida</italic> species can induce granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that protect against <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, although MDSCs express high levels of CD11b and are ROS producers, these cells are different from the trained neutrophils described in this study; MDSC-mediated protection includes abrogation of lethal inflammation whereas trained neutrophils produce higher amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In fact, adoptively transferred MDSCs had no effect on fungal burden <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, whereas adoptive transfer of trained neutrophils diminished the CFUs as these cells exhibited improved ability to kill yeast cells. Therefore, although both cell-types could be protective, they do so through fundamentally different mechanisms. Further experiments to delve on the mechanisms that induce the generation of trained or MDSCs during primary infection are required to understand how host defense strategies are developed toward either host resistance (pathogen elimination) or disease tolerance (limitation of tissue damage).</p><p>We then delved into the mechanisms by which trained neutrophils exhibited improved ability to kill yeast cells. Surprisingly, the higher fungicidal activity of trained neutrophils was independent of phagocytosis, as blocking internalization with cytochalasin B significantly reduced the yeast-killing ability of both control and trained neutrophils, but it did not reduce the fungicidal activity of trained neutrophils to that of controls. Moreover, there was no correlation between the higher expression of CD11b on trained neutrophils and their higher phagocytosis or killing activity <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. However, <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> higher CD11b expression might facilitate neutrophil attachment to the endothelium at sites of infection or inflammation, allowing trained neutrophils to migrate more effectively to the site of injury. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase had no effect on fungicidal activity but interestingly, MitoTEMPO significantly reduced yeast killing capacity of trained neutrophils compared to untreated trained neutrophils, indicating that production of mtROS contributes to the elevated fungicidal activity of trained neutrophils. We revealed that trained neutrophils produced significantly more mtROS than control neutrophils in response to different stimuli, but not in the presence of MitoTEMPO or Antimycin A. In addition, although trained neutrophils produce more NETs than controls, the higher fungicidal activity of trained neutrophils is independent of NETs, as MitoTEMPO significantly reduces the yeast-killing capacity of trained neutrophils, but does not reduce NET formation.</p><p>Our results suggests that HSPCs adopt an infection-responsive program that enhances oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in their derived neutrophils, thereby boosting their fungicidal activity through enhanced mtROS production. Supporting our findings, a previous study has demonstrated that trained neutrophils have enhanced antitumor activity with OXPHOS being identified as a strongly enriched pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The potential role of OXPHOS in innate immune memory was also highlighted by suggestive associations between common single nucleotide polymorphisms in OXPHOS-related genes and the variability in the responsiveness of &#x003b2;-glucan- or oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-trained monocytes [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Production of mtROS is known to increase in macrophages following infection and has been shown to be directly involved in killing intracellular bacteria by macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. More recently, mitochondria have been uncovered as a bactericidal ROS generator in neutrophils to kill <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

In this context, Ding <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., described that &#x003b2;-glucan-trained macrophages inhibit tumour metastasis through a mechanism mediated by enhanced synthesis of sphingolipids and the subsequent accumulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate. This leads to mitochondrial fission, which is required for increased mtROS production and respiration, as well as increased cytotoxicity [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, a recent study also showed that oxLDL-induced trained immunity in human monocytes depends on mitochondrial function [<xref rid="ppat.1013170.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The increased mitochondrial metabolism of innate memory cells contributes to the increase in energy stores but also potentiates the production of mtROS.</p><p>Although future studies are required to define the mechanisms underlying mtROS production by trained neutrophils generated from <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-stimulated HSPCs, our results highlight that mtROS in trained neutrophils play a key role in fungal killing. In summary, our data suggest that infection-experienced HSPCs contribute to trained immunity by providing a source of trained neutrophils with enhanced cytokine production, phagocytosis and fungicidal activity through mtROS production. Modulation of this process may help to improve innate immune responses by inducing trained neutrophils during serious infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal-related experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Valencia (Permit Number: 2022/VSC/PEA/0241, 2023/VSC/PEA/0065) and performed according to Spanish law under &#x0201c;Reales Decretos&#x0201d; 1201/2005 and 53/2013.
