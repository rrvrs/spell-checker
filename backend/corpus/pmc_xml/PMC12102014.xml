In the present study, we first found that <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic>, a serious pathogen in marine environment, could induce LDs accumulation in the liver of obscure puffer <italic>Takifugu obscurus</italic> on the histology, morphology and molecular levels, and the induction mainly conducted by promoting the synthesis of neutral lipids. Moreover, the antibacterial activity of LD proteins was significantly enhanced upon <italic>V. harveyi</italic> stimulation, and showed broad-spectrum characteristic. While the inhibition of LDs formation downregulated the expression of immune-related genes and immune signaling elements, highlighting the potential critical roles of LDs during the bacterial infection. The isolated LDs from obscure puffer liver were examined via proteomic analyses, and the data supported the conservative property of LDs from bacteria to humans, and revealed that numerous innate immune system-related components were enriched on the surface of LDs. These results will deepen the understanding of LDs biology and host immune defense mechanism, shedding light on the new strategies for the development of anti-infective therapies.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s42995-025-00286-w.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Lipid droplets (LDs)</kwd><kwd><italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Takifugu obscurus</italic></kwd><kwd>Antibacterial activity</kwd><kwd>Proteomic analyses</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Ocean University of China 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The lipid droplets (LDs, also known as lipid bodies) are ubiquitous and dynamic organelles found in all types of eukaryotic cells as well as in some prokaryotes (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>; den Brok et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>; Olzmann and Carvalho <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>). As major lipid storage organelles, LDs are the repository of neutral lipids, and modulate protein segregation, toxic lipids&#x02019; elimination as well as cellular signaling (Bosch and Pol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2022</xref>; Olzmann and Carvalho <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>; Welte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2015</xref>; Zadoorian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2023</xref>). In the last two decades, accelerated evidences showed that LDs are a multifunctional organelle and actively participate in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, membrane trafficking (Welte and Gould <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>), cell signaling (Kagan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>), as well as inflammation (Pereira-Dutra and Bozza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2021</xref>). Especially, recent advancements found that host LDs are active innate immunity players through mediating immunometabolism, immune signaling, and microbial killing (Bosch and Pol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2022</xref>; den Brok et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">LDs are cellular organelles for lipid metabolism, and predominantly comprise a neutral lipid core (mostly triacylglycerols (TAGs) and cholesteryl esters (CEs)), enveloped by a single layer of phospholipids decorated with a diverse set of proteins (Olzmann and Carvalho <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>; Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>; Zhang and Liu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>). Distinct from adipocytes, immune cells as well as other non-adipocytes have virtually no or fewer LDs under resting conditions, whereas accumulated LDs were observed when host challenged by different triggers (Bosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; Knight et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>; Monson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">b</xref>; Pereira-Dutra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2019</xref>; Rabhi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2016</xref>). Especially, pathogenic microorganisms&#x02019; infection significantly affects LDs formation in the host immune-related cells (Bosch and Pol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2022</xref>; den Brok et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>). For example, the number of LDs in dendritic cells (DCs) was significantly increased during infection by <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic> or <italic>Nocardia brasiliensis</italic> (Herber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>). The similar phenomenon was also observed in invertebrate <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, and LDs were induced when challenged with <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>, Sindbis, and Dengue viruses (Barletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>). In addition, it was reported that pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), mannans, virus mimetics poly I:C, also could induce the accumulation of LDs, as well as the expressions of lipid-related genes in immune and endothelial cells (Bosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>; Czamara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>; Lei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>; Monson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">b</xref>). Moreover, increased LDs were observed in the infected as well as the adjacent but uninfected cells post killed pathogen stimulation (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>; Rabhi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2016</xref>). While contrary to the traditional views that pathogens could capture and absorb the nutrients and energy from LDs for settlement (Roingeard and Melo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2017</xref>), Matthew Knight et al<italic>.</italic> found that <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> can still accumulate lipids in macrophages under the conditions of LDs&#x02019; depletion (Knight et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>). Moreover, Monson et al<italic>.</italic> found that after infected with herpes simplex virus 1 and Zika virus, the increased LDs significantly inhibited the virus&#x02019;s replication ability in mice (Monson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">b</xref>), whereas loss of LD mass enhances viral replication (Monson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2018</xref>). Thus, host LD accumulation upon infection seems to be a host-driven defense mechanism, which have been coevolved with the host&#x02013;pathogens interactions.</p><p id="Par4">Currently, LDs&#x02019; accumulation was considered as a hallmark of successful immune response, and the immunologic defense mechanism of LDs has attracted increasing attention (Bosch and Pol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2022</xref>; Pereira-Dutra and Bozza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2021</xref>). For instance, after treated with inhibitors for LDs&#x02019; formation, the phagocytic ability, the production of cytokines (such as IFN, IL, etc<italic>.</italic>), as well as antimicrobial peptides of mice macrophages significantly decreased following the decrease of the neutral lipid contents (TAGs and CEs) and the expressions of genes involved in the synthesis of TAGs and CEs (DGAT1, DGAT2, ACSL3, FASN, ACAT, etc<italic>.</italic>) (Castoldi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>; Knight et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>; Monson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">b</xref>). Similarly, various cell types (such as HeLa cells and hepatic cells) with reduced cellular LD contents also showed significantly reduced cytokine production (Monson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2018</xref>; Truong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020</xref>), indicating that LDs might play critical role during the immune response against pathogen infection. LD proteins were proved to be vital for LDs organization and function. Numerous LD proteins have been revealed in various cell types and activation conditions by proteomics approaches (Dhiman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>; Pereira-Dutra and Bozza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2021</xref>). An interesting study in invertebrate Drosophila showed that LD proteins extracted from Drosophila embryos could significantly inhibit bacterial growth (Anand et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>). Similarly, LD proteins extracted from LPS stimulated mice liver exhibited extremely strong antibacterial ability (Bosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). Proteomic studies provided broader insights into the functioning of LDs. For example, LD proteome of HeLa CCL2 was found to be modified in the context of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> infection (Saka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>). Comparative proteomics revealed that IFN induced anti-viral proteins viperin, immune-related GTPase (IGTP), and histones are specifically enriched on the surface of LDs, and intrinsic immune signaling pathway elements, such as STING, TBK1, IRAK1, and TRAF6, are all co-localized on the LDs&#x02019; surface (Bosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; Crosse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2021</xref>; Hinson and Cresswell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2009</xref>; Saitoh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2011</xref>). These studies indicate that LDs functions directly and actively during the innate immune response. However, the specific roles and regulation mechanism of LDs in innate immunity remain relatively unexplored, and the existing studies were mainly limited to mammals. Further exploration is urgently needed to investigate this antibacterial effect in different pathogen infection models.</p><p id="Par5">Fish has long been one of the research models due to the high diversity of species and the unique evolutionary status. <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> is a widely regarded pathogenic bacteria in marine aquaculture environment, even posing a great threat to human health (Mohi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2010</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2020</xref>).

As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A, TAGs exhibited a sharp decrease from 11.11% of wet weight in the liver from control group, to 9.51% in the low-dose treatment group (0.125&#x000a0;mg) and 4.51% in the high-dose treatment group (0.25&#x000a0;mg, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), indicating that the treatment of T863 significantly inhibits the TAG synthesis in liver. While no remarkable differences were detected between the control and T863 treatment group in head kidney (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). In addition, immunoblot analysis was performed using LD marker PLIN3. Compared with the control group, the indicative bands for PLIN3 significantly weakened under the T863 treatment. The high-dose treatment (0.25&#x000a0;mg) showed stronger suppression effect than the low-dose treatment (0.125&#x000a0;mg) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). To assess whether LD induction following <italic>V. harveyi</italic> stimulation also follows a T863 inhibition mechanism, obscure puffer fish were treated with T863 after the <italic>V. harveyi</italic> stimulation. Compared with the control and <italic>V. harveyi</italic> treatment group, TAG contents in liver exhibited significant decreasement in the Vh&#x02009;+&#x02009;T863 co-treatment group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C). Similarly, indicative bands for PLIN3 significantly weakened in the Vh&#x02009;+&#x02009;T863 co-treatment group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D), indicating that T863 treatment decreased the induction of <italic>V. harveyi</italic> stimulation on the LDs formation. Next, the host immune responses against bacterial stimulation post-LDs reduced were examined. Compared with the control group, <italic>V. harveyi</italic> stimulation significantly enhanced the expressions of <italic>NK-lysin</italic>, <italic>TNF14</italic> and <italic>ISG15</italic>. While the expressions of all the examined genes (<italic>NK-lysin</italic>, <italic>TNF14</italic>, <italic>ISG15</italic>, IL-1, Mx1, and IFN&#x003b3;) were significantly decreased in the Vh&#x02009;+&#x02009;T863 co-treatment group compared with that in the Vh treatment group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E).

However, more recently, numerous studies have revealed that LDs accumulated rapidly upon pathogen infection, and it was proposed that host innate immunity rewires lipid metabolism and weaponizes LDs during bacterial infections (Bosch and Pol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2022</xref>). Here, we studied for the first time that the induction of LDs post-stimulation with marine pathogenic bacteria <italic>V. harveyi</italic> in obscure puffer <italic>T. obscurus</italic>, and performed a proteomic and functional study to investigate the dynamic changes and potential regulatory function of LDs during bacterial infection in fish.</p><p id="Par32">Although there were reports that few bacteria were unable to trigger LDs formation (D'Avila et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>), boosting evidences demonstrated that bacteria, virus, parasites, as well as components from bacterial cell wall (such as LPS, BCG or LAM) could induce LDs accumulation, and this phenomenon has been considered as a hallmark during inflammatory processes (Bosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; Castoldi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>; den Brok et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>; Monson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">b</xref>; Wan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2007</xref>). However, most studies are focused on the interaction between intracellular pathogens and host LDs (Roingeard and Melo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2017</xref>), and limited to mammalians and few model invertebrates (Anand et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>; Barletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>; Bosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). In this study, we analyzed for the first time that the infection with <italic>V. harveyi</italic>, which is a kind of facultative bacteria and threatens both for humans and marine animals (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2022</xref>), could induce LDs accumulation in the liver of <italic>T. obscurus</italic> in an in vivo setting. Consistent with previous studies in mammals, the number and size of LDs as well as the expression of LDs marker protein PLIN2, were significantly induced upon infection with live and killed <italic>V. harveyi</italic>, confirming the induction of <italic>V. harveyi</italic> on the LDs accumulation. Moreover, we observed that <italic>V. harveyi</italic> induced LDs formation via a dose- and time-dependent manner. This finding was also in accordance with prior studies in mammals which showed that the LPS treatment promoted LDs&#x02019; formation in a similar manner (Bosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; Pacheco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2002</xref>). Notably, LDs number rapidly increased at 24&#x000a0;h, while the size of LDs apparently enlarged at 48&#x000a0;h post-stimulation, showing the dynamic change of LDs during the bacterial infection. This phenomenon of increased LDS size at 48&#x000a0;h may be more akin to fusion, which was similar with the previous studies on mosquitoes <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, where significant fusion of LDs occurred after pathogen invasion of the gut, with a significant increase in size (Barletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>). In addition, it has been evidenced that LDs could be induced via multiple mechanisms (Olzmann and Carvalho <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>). Here, several genes involved in LD biogenesis, including neutral lipid synthesis and degradation, fatty acid synthase, and transport, were significantly regulated upon <italic>V. harveyi</italic> stimulation, demonstrating that <italic>V. harveyi</italic> infection induced LDs accumulation mainly via promoting neutral lipids synthesis. This in part corresponds to what Lei et al. (Lei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>) detected in grass carp head kidney cells, where LDs number and TAG contents were significantly upregulated stimulated by LPS or poly I: C, suggesting that the LDs formation might be an antibacterial defense strategy in the bony fish. Together, those findings collectively indicate that <italic>V. harveyi</italic> could induce LDs formation in a time- and dose-manner via regulating neutral lipid synthesis and degradation.</p><p id="Par33">Proteomic analysis of LDs has produced a quantity of LDs proteins, which corroborating the function of LDs as well as evidencing that its function is conserved from bacteria to human (Bersuker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2018</xref>; Krahmer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>; Sui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2023</xref>; Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2012</xref>). To investigate the dynamic changes and potential regulation mechanism of LDs during bacterial infection, LDs were isolated and performed proteomics studies. Apart from the LD proteomes in fish (Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2023</xref>), most of the identified proteins in the present study have been reported in previous LD proteomes of yeast, Drosophila, and mammals (Bersuker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2018</xref>; Bosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; Currie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>; Krahmer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>; Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2012</xref>), supporting the conservative property of LDs from bacteria to humans. Briefly, similar with the previous reported LD proteomes, the LD proteome in the present study revealed that numerous LD regulatory scaffold proteins (PLIN2 and PLIN3) and TAG metabolism enzymes, which played critical roles during LD biogenesis. Other proteins common to LDs of other cells (Bersuker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2018</xref>; Bosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>) were also found in the LD proteome, indicating the confidence LD proteome of obscure puffer liver. Surprisingly, the proteome in the present study contained a large number of mitochondria-associated proteins, as well as ERs and peroxisome proteins, which was consistent with the findings in zebrafish and <italic>Carassius auratus</italic> (Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2023</xref>), but was much higher than the ratio in mammalian LD proteomics (Bosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). On the one hand, this result might be because of the highly motility of LDs that LDs can closely associate with other cytoplasmic organelles/structures (Monson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2021b</xref>; Pereira-Dutra and Bozza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2021</xref>; Wan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2007</xref>). On the other hand, nascent LDs originate from the ER (Olzmann and Carvalho <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>). LD-associated proteome has been reported as dynamic and complex, the composition of LD housing proteins varied according to the metabolic state and activation of cells (Bosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; Olzmann and Carvalho <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>; Pereira-Dutra and Bozza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2021</xref>; Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>; Zhang and Liu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>). In the present study, <italic>V. harveyi</italic> stimulation induced more than 200 LD-associated proteins significantly expressed. Most proteins participate in lipid storage as well as LDs biogenesis. Among of which myeloid derived growth factor (<italic>mydgf</italic>) exhibited significant upregulation upon bacterial infection, this finding was consistent with the previous reports that cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were distributed on the newly formed LDs upon leukocytes&#x02019; activation (Wan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2007</xref>). In addition, histones were found on LDs in a number of animal cells and tissues (Anand et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>), and exhibited significant increase post <italic>V. harveyi</italic> stimulation. These results supported the hypothesis that LDs may have in host response to infection. Another prominent module, possessing functions related to the ubiquitin system, was also upregulated, which might be involved in the regulation of LDs&#x02019; turnover (Alberts and Rotin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>). Of note, although <italic>V. harveyi</italic> stimulation induced the LDs&#x02019; accumulation in liver as well as a series of differentially expressed proteins, a few innate immune system-related components were enriched on the surface of LDs, which was significantly distinct from the results in mammals (Bosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed an enhancement of oxidative phosphorylation, which have been demonstrated to selectively orchestrate tissue macrophage homeostasis (Wculek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2023</xref>). In summary, these analyses suggested that numerous immunity-related proteins were found on the LDs, and <italic>V. harveyi</italic> stimulation modulated the component of LDs proteins.</p><p id="Par34">Current studies revealed that LDs not only store lipids, but also participate in the host&#x02019;s immune processes (Bosch and Pol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2022</xref>; Bosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; den Brok et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>; Pereira-Dutra and Bozza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2021</xref>). The antibacterial activity of LDs could be induced upon pathogen infection which had been demonstrated in mammals (Bosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). Recently, studies in the zebrafish and Drosophila showed that embryos rich in LDs exhibited stronger resistance against bacterial infection (Anand et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>). In this study, enhanced antibacterial activity of LDs post <italic>V. harveyi</italic> stimulation were first detected in fish, strengthening the critical role of LDs during the bacterial infection. Notably, Vh-LDs not only inhibited the grow of Gram-negative bacteria, but also inhibit the Gram-positive bacteria, showing a novel broad-spectrum immunity. In mammalians, LDs were proved to function during the host immune response by modulating the production of inflammation mediators. The inhibitor of DGAT1 T863 can effectively inhibit LDs formation both in mammals and fish (Knight et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>; Monson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021a</xref>; Xiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2021</xref>). In the present study, we found that treatment with T863 had a strong effect on TAG levels and markedly abolished LDs formation in liver of obscure puffer, which was compliance with the previous studies (Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2021</xref>; Xiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2021</xref>). Of note, LD downregulation was accompanied by significantly downregulated immune-related genes&#x02019; transcription, even under the stimulation of <italic>V. harveyi</italic>, which showing a strong connection between LD formation and the immune response.</p><p id="Par35">In conclusion, these results in present study first showed that <italic>V. harveyi</italic> could induce LDs&#x02019; accumulation in the liver of obscure puffer mainly by promoting the synthesis of neutral lipids. Moreover, <italic>V. harveyi</italic> stimulation promoted the enriching of immune-related factors on the LDs surface, and the <italic>V. harveyi</italic> stimulated LDs display enhanced and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. While the inhibition of LDs formation downregulated the expression of immune-related genes, highlighting the potential critical roles of LDs during the bacterial infection. The research results will deepen the understanding of LDs biology and host immune defense mechanism, shedding light on the new strategies for the development of anti-infective therapies, ultimately supporting the healthy and green development of the aquaculture industry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="42995_2025_286_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 2208 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Project for Seed Industry Vitalization of Jiangsu Province (JBGS [2021]133), Special Project Funds for Youth Science and Technology (B240201162), the Open Sharing Fund for the Large-scale Instruments of Hohai University (B220370216), and the Research Funds of the Jiangsu Marine Bioresources Innovation Center (2022YHTZZZ04).</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>XRS and YXY: methodology, data acquisition, data analysis, data curation, validation, writing, editing, and figure production.
