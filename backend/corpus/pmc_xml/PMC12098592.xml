This exhaustion negatively affects the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of lymphocytes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In chronic HBV infection, both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells show elevated levels of PD-1, indicating T cell exhaustion (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Similarly, B cells in HIV-infected patients exhibit exhaustion with increased expression of Fc&#x003b3;RIIB, leading to impaired B cell function and antibody (Ab) production (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Taken together, T-cell exhaustion weakens the cytotoxic response necessary for clearing the virus, while B-cell exhaustion compromises the effectiveness of the humoral response against the virus. However, the factors that can ameliorate or reverse lymphocyte exhaustion in order to promote activation of T cells and B cells in chronic viral infections for the treatment of patients require further research.</p><p>Recovering from immune exhaustion in persistent viral infections represents a primary objective in the advancement of novel therapeutics. Research has generated compelling evidence endorsing the targeting of inhibitory receptors with checkpoint inhibitors, such as the use of monoclonal Abs aimed at PD-1, which has proven effective in enhancing T cell functionality in individuals with human HIV and HBV infections (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Additionally, the remarkable success of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal Abs in cancer therapy underscores the potential importance of targeting these pathways for the prevention and management of various infectious diseases (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). While antiviral drugs continue to be the mainstay treatment for immune exhaustion and chronic viral infections, immune checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD-1 have emerged as potential therapeutic options. However, the effectiveness of antiviral drugs in combating immune exhaustion remains uncertain. Additionally, the widespread use of checkpoint inhibitors is hindered by factors such as high cost, long circulating half-life, and the potential for severe side effects, including life-threatening cytokine storms. Therefore, further research and development of safer and more cost-effective therapies are necessary to address immune exhaustion and chronic viral infections effectively.</p><p>Chemical compounds offer an alternative approach to deliver immune checkpoint inhibition, addressing some of the challenges associated with monoclonal Ab inhibitors. Chemical compounds generally have a faster turnover rate than monoclonal Abs in circulation, making them potentially more suitable for therapeutic applications. Furthermore, the risk of cytokine storms may be reduced compared to monoclonal Ab-based therapies. Importantly, they can be manufactured more easily and at a lower cost, allowing for broader accessibility for patients. Therefore, the development of chemical compounds as immune checkpoint inhibitors holds promise for overcoming the limitations of monoclonal Abs and improving the treatment of immune exhaustion and chronic viral infections.</p><p>By employing a cell-based gene promoter reporter assay, we conducted a screen of compounds with the capability to reduce the gene transcription of both Fc&#x003b3;RIIB and PD-1 in BJAB B cells (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). From the pool of candidate compounds identified, our focus narrowed to CCT007093, an inhibitor of wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1, also known as PPM1D). Wip1 is a serine/threonine phosphatase mainly localized in the nucleus (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). To assess the potential of CCT007093 in countering immune exhaustion within the context of chronic viral infection, we harnessed an established murine model of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for therapeutic and mechanistic investigations (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Reagents</title><p>CCT007093 (IC<sub>50</sub>: 8.4 &#x003bc;M) and DMSO were purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX, USA). Recombinant HBsAg and HBcAg proteins were acquired from Sino Biological. For immunoblotting, specific Abs to detect p65 NF-&#x003ba;B, phospho-p65 NF-&#x003ba;B (Ser 536), p53, phospho-p53 (Ser 15), and Wip1 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Anti-PD-1 and anti-YY1 Abs were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), while anti-Fc&#x003b3;RIIB Ab was ordered from Genetex Inc. (Irvin, CA, USA). Cell activation kit (ionomycin + PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate)) and anti-IFN-&#x003b3; Abs were purchased from Biolegend. Anti-&#x003b2;-actin Ab was ordered from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO, USA). Anti-myc Ab was purchased from Proteintech (Rosemont, IL, USA). The protein G-sepharose beads were sourced from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Both horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse Abs were obtained from Jackson ImmunoReasearch (West Grove, PA, USA). Monoclonal Abs for flow cytometry were ordered from Biolegend and BD Biosciences (Becton, NJ, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The HBc175 mutant pAAV/HBV1.2 construct was generously provided by Dr. Pei-Jer Chen at National Taiwan University. This construct expresses HBcAg proteins with a C-terminal deletion of 10 amino acids (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The Wip1 cDNA plasmid (GV227-Wip1) was obtained from GeneChem (Shanghai, China) and subsequently subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/myc-His B vector. The pCMV6-XL5-YY1 plasmid was acquired from Origene (Rockville, MD, USA). Serum HBsAg levels were measured with an AXSYM system kit (Abbott GmbH Diagnostica, Wiesbaden, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>Animals and hydrodynamic injection</title><p>Male C57BL/6J mice, aged 5 to 6 weeks, were acquired from the Center for Laboratory Animals of the College of Medicine, National Taiwan University (NTU). These mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines and approved protocols from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the College of Medicine, NTU, under the protocol numbers: 20130228 and 20170401. The hydrodynamic injection procedure, aimed at inducing HBV-associated immune exhaustion in mice, has been previously documented (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In brief, we administered 10 &#x003bc;g of purified HBc175 plasmid DNAs in approximately 1.5 ml PBS (equivalent to 8% of each mouse&#x02019;s body weight) via the tail vein, resulting in rapid hepatocyte rupture for <italic>in vivo</italic> transfection. Starting four weeks after the hydrodynamic injection, serum levels of HBsAg in mice were monitored at 2-week intervals using an AXSYM system kit (Abbott GmbH Diagnostica, Wiesbaden, Germany). The persistence of HBsAg in the serum beyond four weeks post-injection indicates the successful induction of chronic HBV infection and immune exhaustion. This method enables HBV persistence for over a year in a substantial proportion of mice (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Typically, we achieved successful immune exhaustion in approximately 50-60% of the mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><title>Cell preparation from blood, spleen and liver</title><p>Mouse blood was collected by puncturing the submandibular vein using lancets, with the blood being collected into a K<sub>2</sub>EDTA-coated tube (BD Biosciences). Splenocytes were isolated as previously detailed (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). To isolate intrahepatic leukocytes, the mouse liver was minced using scissors. Sections of the liver were placed into two 10-cm petri dishes, each containing 10 ml of digestion buffer (0.04% collagenase IV and 0.002% DNase I dissolved in PBS). The liver pieces were gently crushed with a sterile syringe plunger and passed through a 100-&#x003bc;m cell strainer to eliminate connective tissues. The liver suspensions were then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 45 min in an incubator. Subsequent to incubation, the liver cell mixture was collected into a 50 ml conical tube and centrifuged at 30&#x000d7;g (500 rpm) for 3 min to separate hepatocytes. Following centrifugation, the cell pellets were re-suspended in RBC lysis buffer and incubated at room temperature for 5 min to eliminate erythrocytes. This was followed by another centrifugation at 2,200 rpm for 15 min. The pellets were then re-suspended in 4 ml of PBS and cautiously layered onto the top of a Percoll gradient, containing 4 ml of 25% Percoll solution (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The layer of 25% Percoll was placed over the 4 ml of 80% Percoll in a 15 ml tube. The cells were then centrifuged at 2,500 rpm at 25&#x000b0;C for 25 min. The intrahepatic leukocytes were carefully collected from the interface between the 25% and 80% Percoll layers and subsequently washed with 10 ml of PBS. Following a centrifugation step at 2,200 rpm for 10 min, the resulting cell pellets were harvested for subsequent flow cytometric analysis. Typically, we isolated 1-2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> leukocytes from the liver of each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s2_5"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>For T cells, specific Abs of CD45-BV421 (clone 104), CD3-APC-Cy7 (clone 145-2C11), CD4-Alexa 647 (clone GK1.5), CD8-BV510 (clone 53-6.7), PD-1-PE (clone 29F.1A12), and CD127-FITC (clone A7R34) were added and incubated at 4&#x000b0;C for 20 min. 7-AAD was used for exclusion of dead cells. For additional analysis of T cells, Tim-3-PE (clone B8.2C12), CTLA-4-PE (clone UC10-4B9), TIGIT-PE (clone 4D4/mTIGIT) were used, replacing PD-1-PE in the staining protocol. For B cells, the CD16/32-FITC Abs (clone 2.4G2) were initially added for a 5-min incubation period, followed by an additional 20-min incubation with CD19-PE-Cy7 (clone 6D5) and PD-1-PE Abs at 4&#x000b0;C. For hepatic Kupffer cells, CD11b-FITC (clone M1/70), F4/80-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone BM8) and PD-L1-PE (clone 10F.9G2) were used. For intracellular staining, isolated intrahepatic leukocytes (5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>/ml) were cultured in the presence of a stimulation agent cocktail for a duration of 3 hr. Subsequently, the cells were collected and labeled with CD3-APC-Cy7 (clone 145-2C11), CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone RM 4-5), and CD8-BB515 (clone 53-6.7) Abs on ice for a period of 20 min. After the completion of the staining process, the cells were subjected to permeabilization and fixation using a fixation/permeabilization kit (BD Biosciences, #555028) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction. This was followed by the addition of IFN-&#x003b3;-PE (clone XMG1.2) or rat IgG1-PE isotype (clone G0114F7) Abs, with an additional 30-min incubation on ice. After the necessary washing steps, the cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. Fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls were included in the analysis for detecting inhibitory receptors and IFN-&#x003b3; expression.

The dual-luciferase reporter system from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) was utilized to measure the transcriptional activities of promoters. For cell transfection, the Amaxa&#x02122; Nucleofector kit V from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) was used. Briefly, 1&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> BJAB B cells were transfected with 20 &#x003bc;g of pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmids containing 2,200 bp, 1,636 bp, 1,075 bp and 926 bp promoter sequences upstream of ATG of PD-1 gene (Genebank access no.

Simultaneously, the <italic>renilla</italic> luciferase reporter constructs (500 ng) was co-transfected as internal controls for transfection efficiency and for normalization of luciferase activities. Following cell electroporation for 4 hr, cells were treated with vehicle, 2 or 5 &#x003bc;M CCT007093 in triplicates and incubated for an additional 24 hr.

To explore this, we treated BJAB B cells with increasing concentrations of CCT007093 (0, 5, 10 or 25 &#x003bc;M) for 15 min, 1 hr and 6 hr, followed by western blot analysis to assess phosphorylation changes.

</xref>, PD-1 and Fc&#x003b3;RIIB protein levels notably decreased at 6 hr in a dose-dependent manner. Wip1 inhibition by CCT007093 led to an initial increase in p-p65 NF-&#x003ba;B (Ser 535) phosphorylation at 15 min, although this effect was transient, reverting to basal phosphorylation levels by the 6-hour mark. On the contrary, p53 (Ser 15) phosphorylation was observed at 1 hr and persisted up to 6 hr. It is important to note that, despite the inhibition of Wip1&#x02019;s phosphatase activity, the expression levels of Wip1 were unaffected by CCT007093 (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">

Based on this, we hypothesize that chemical compounds capable of down-regulating inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1 and Fc&#x003b3;RIIB, may similarly enhance T and B cell activation. In this study we present compelling evidence that CCT007093 mitigates immune exhaustion in HBV-infected mice. Our results demonstrate that CCT007093 effectively reduce PD-1 and Fc&#x003b3;RIIB expression across multiple compartments, including the peripheral blood, spleen, and liver (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">

Notably, previous studies indicate that CCT007093 enhances liver regeneration and improves survival following major hepatectomy (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), suggesting an additional indirect hepatoprotective role. Taken together, our findings support the concept that chemical checkpoint inhibition can effectively reactivate exhausted immune cells in chronic HBV infection in mice.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying CCT007093&#x02019;s ability to inhibit Wip1, subsequently down-regulating PD-1 and Fc&#x003b3;RIIB expression, are intricate, involving a network of regulatory pathways encompassing p53, p65 NF-&#x003ba;B, CREB, GATA, and YY1 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Considering Wip1&#x02019;s known interaction with multiple transcription factors as its substrates (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), we conducted a comparative transcriptomic analysis between T cells and B cells. This exploration unveiled p65 NF-&#x003ba;B and YY1 as the central targets inhibited by Wip1, leading to the down-regulation of PD-1 and Fc&#x003b3;RIIB, consequently promoting lymphocyte activation (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figures&#x000a0;6</bold>
</xref>-<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">
<bold>8</bold>
</xref>). These findings are consistent with the established role of activated p65 NF-&#x003ba;B in fostering the pro-inflammatory environment driving lymphocyte activation to bolster the adaptive immune response. Studies supporting our findings demonstrate that mice lacking Wip1 produce higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines&#x02013;such as IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8&#x02013;dependent on p65 NF-&#x003ba;B, in their splenic cells. Conversely, it has been evidenced that Wip1 overexpression can dose-dependently reduce p65 NF-&#x003ba;B activation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). These findings suggest that Wip1 inhibition enhances lymphocyte activation by stimulating p65 NF-&#x003ba;B, which downregulates PD-1 and Fc&#x003b3;RIIB expression, thereby lowering the activation threshold of lymphocytes and promoting further activation.</p><p>Beyond p65 NF-&#x003ba;B, previous research indicates that silencing YY1 can rejuvenate T cells in patients with chronic HIV infection (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). On the other hand, Fc&#x003b3;RIIB has gained increasing recognition as an Ab checkpoint crucial for enhancing humoral protection (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Overexpression of YY1 has been shown to enhance the transcription of Fc&#x003b3;RIIB gene in primary and transformed B cells. On the contrary, the loss of the single YY1 binding site at &#x02013;385 region of promoter sequences (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure&#x000a0;6B</bold>
</xref>) due to a single nucleotide polymorphism significantly diminishes Fc&#x003b3;RIIB expression (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). These observations suggest that YY1, rather than p65 NF-&#x003ba;B, primarily influences the transcriptional regulation of PD-1 and Fc&#x003b3;RIIB. Therefore, silencing YY1 appears beneficial for the humoral response by promoting the generation of antiviral Abs for Ab-mediated cytotoxicity. However, PhosphoSitePlus (v6.7.1.1) notes that both mouse and human YY1 proteins contain numerous potential phosphorylation sites. Mouse YY1 has at least 8 serine residues and 4 threonine residues, while human YY1 has 10 serine residues and 3 threonine residues. Identifying the specific serine or threonine residue requiring phosphorylation to positively regulate the gene expression of PD-1 and Fc&#x003b3;RIIB is crucial for the development of specific modulators.</p><p>The success of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades has significantly expanded their applications in the treatment of cancer patients (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, in the context of chronic infections and immune exhaustion, the application of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies is notably less common. Despite their effectiveness, the high cost of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy presents a substantial barrier to its utilization in chronic infections. Drawing from our findings, we propose the use of a chemical modulator for both PD-1 and Fc&#x003b3;RIIB, e.g., CCT007093, to reactivate lymphocytes and enhance immune responses. When used in combination with antiviral drugs, this approach has the potential to significantly augment the efficacy of treatment for patients with chronic infections, especially those suffering from immune exhaustion. Compared to Ab-based PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, chemical drugs offer advantages in terms of affordability and safety due to their relatively short half life. Our findings from CCT007093 treatment also highlight several key transcription factors that could be targeted to reduce expression levels of PD-1 and Fc&#x003b3;RIIB, either individually or concurrently. Importantly, our data strongly support the concept of dual or multiple targeting to inhibitory receptors to activate both the cytotoxic and humoral arms of the immune system, potentially resulting in superior therapeutic synergism. The optimal strategy would involve the use of small molecules to block the action of immune checkpoint receptors, combining them with antiviral treatments, and identifying the novel, safer and more effective immunotherapeutic targets.</p><p>Additionally, our findings have implications for the application of chemical checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of cancer patients. Based on our data, we reason that CCT007093 may not be an effective remedy for cancer. This speculation primarily stems from the well-established role of p65 NF-&#x003ba;B in promoting tumor growth (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Therefore, it is not surprising to know that CCT007093 treatment has shown inconsistent therapeutic benefits in different types of cancers with wild-type p53 (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Nevertheless, our findings suggest that YY1 could be a more suitable target for enhancing T cell cytotoxicity and inhibiting tumor growth. YY1 is a ubiquitously distributed transcription factor belonging to the GLI-Kruppel class of zinc finger proteins. Its role as a transcriptional repressor or activator varies depending on the cellular context (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In cancer cells, YY1 modulates immune resistance by enhancing PD-L1 expression (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and promotes cancer metastasis. These findings highlight YY1 as a more promising target for chemical drugs to alleviate immune exhaustion caused by cancer cells. As mentioned earlier, blocking Fc&#x003b3;RIIB can enhance the production of anti-tumor Abs, which is crucial for enhancing cancer immunotherapy (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we present a novel strategy to address immune exhaustion of lymphocytes and demonstrate its feasibility. CCT007093 and its derivatives emerge as promising candidate compounds for treating immune exhaustion in infectious diseases (<xref rid="f9" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure&#x000a0;9</bold>
</xref>). Moreover, the exploration and characterization of chemical compounds to reduce the expression levels of inhibitory receptors hold significant potential for expanding therapeutic options in cancer patients. Furthermore, the critical role of Fc&#x003b3;RIIB in enhancing humoral protection against infection and tumor appears to be under-recognized. Therefore, future research efforts should consider including Fc&#x003b3;RIIB in the development of new checkpoint inhibitors. This is particularly important when safeguarding against acute bacterial and viral infections, as we and other researchers have recently affirmed (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).
