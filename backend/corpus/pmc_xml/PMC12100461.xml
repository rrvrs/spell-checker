<bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
</p><p id="para170">Although a number of health products, such as drugs, devices, vaccines, and diagnostics, have been developed, the launch and scale up of such health products is lagging, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). To better understand the end-to-end pathway of the launch and scale up of health products, we searched PubMed from Dec 5 to Dec 19, 2022, for articles published in English with the following search terms: (&#x0201c;research and develop*&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;regulatory&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;launch&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;scale&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;implement&#x0201d;) AND (&#x0201c;accelerat*&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;delay&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;enabl*&#x0201d;OR &#x0201c;barrier&#x0201d; OR&#x0201c;sustain*&#x0201d;) AND (&#x0201c;product&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;innovation&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;drug&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;device&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;vaccine&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;diagnostic&#x0201d;) AND &#x0201c;health&#x0201d;. We found mostly qualitative studies or case studies that discuss the factors that might affect the end-to-end pathway of the launch and scale up of health products. Quantitative evidence has been found about the success rate and timeline of research and development, mostly in high-income countries. We found limited data on the timeline and influencing factors for launch and scale up in LMICs. We also observed that research and development, launch, and sustainable scale up were studied separately instead of as a connected process.</p><p id="para180">
<bold>Added value of this study</bold>
</p><p id="para190">This study is the first to report on the timeline from ideation to sustainable scale up of health products across different product types, health conditions, and in LMICs. It is also the first study to provide empirical evidence on the effect of different factors on the end-to-end pathway of the launch and scale up of health products in LMICs. We found that among 59 included health products, the median time to bring a product from ideation to at least 20% uptake in LMICs was 13&#x000b7;5 years. Ideation to proof of concept was the longest interval (median 6&#x000b7;9 years) for most product types, followed by the first country launch to at least 20% uptake in LMICs (3&#x000b7;8 years). Multiple factors, such as type of developer, market type, and buying environment, were observed to have an impact on launch and scale timelines.</p><p id="para200">
<bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
</p><p id="para210">Funders, developers, regulators, and country policy makers can use the findings from this Article to set more realistic expectations, create enabling environments, and more efficiently direct resources to support the development, launch, and scale up of health products to reach more people. Better coordination and planning across different stages along the development to scale up pathway, and among different players and stakeholders, could accelerate the process. A crucial area for future investment would be the establishment of a publicly available evidence base to prospectively track the end-to-end launch and scale up of health interventions, with a standardised set of global and country level milestones and characteristics.</p></boxed-text>

Cross-reference was used to source the information. Cross-reference and outreach to key stakeholders involved in the development and scaling up of the products were also used to obtain more information or referral on information sources.</p><p id="para250">Milestone dates were collected in the format day-month-year. For dates with only the year available, we assigned the milestone to be the midpoint of the year (ie, July 1st). For dates with the year and month available, but not the day, we assigned the milestone to be the midpoint of the month (ie, the 15th). LMIC coverage was measured from demand, supply, or policy perspectives (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 1&#x02013;6</xref>). We selected the 20% uptake milestone due to the larger availability of data for this milestone. Additionally, we searched literature to collect ten qualitative characteristics such as buying environment and market type. Definitions and specific information about data collection can be found in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 2)</xref>.

If the median interval by product type was not available either, we then used the median interval of products with the same health condition. We made the following assumptions for products without certain characteristic information: if all other products of the same product type or the same health condition shared the same characteristic value, then this value was assigned to the missing datapoint (for example, all vector control products had a centralised buying environment, so a vector control product with a missing value for buying environment was assigned a centralised buying environment); and if one characteristic was associated with another characteristic, then these two characteristics were used to assign missing values (for example, all products with centralised buying environments also had global markets; therefore, products with a global market but that had a missing value for buying environment were assigned centralised buying environments).

We used robust regression models with multiple explanatory variables to test our hypothesis on product characteristics and milestone intervals. Robust regression is selected for its better capacity than the ordinary least squares regression in estimating data with outliers or influential observations. It uses an iteratively reweighted least squares method to assign a weight to each data point.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> We chose two dependent variables: ideation to first country launch and first country launch to LMIC uptake of at least 20% to reflect the launch and scale-up of products.

These findings can inform priorities and decisions for stakeholders, including product developers, funders, implementers who focus on certain stages of the end-to-end pathway, and communities of practice concentrated on specific diseases or health conditions, who can benefit from better understanding the time and key driving factors along the path to scale-up.</p><p id="para350">To launch a product and attain limited scale-up in LMICs can take more than a decade. Similar patterns have been reported in the USA and Europe, although scale-up data is sparse.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> These data highlight the urgency to address end-to-end development, introduction, and scale-up of health products in a more coordinated way. Our findings could inform funders and developers to set realistic expectations and allocate sufficient resources to launch and scale-up new products, including heightened emphasis on key barriers.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Viewing product development through scale-up as an interconnected, non-linear process enables funders and developers to prepare adequate resources, partnerships, and handoffs to ensure products reach their intended users more effectively and efficiently. Such coordination could also reduce the total time to scale-up as funders and developers better prepare for and set the stage for implementation during the development stage.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> For example, a WHO report identified the need to address research, norms and standards, implementation, and advocacy as four strategic, interdependent areas to combat postpartum haemorrhage.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Thus a more comprehensive and systematic approach should be considered beyond the product-by-product approach. Addressing complex health challenges requires integrated, bundled innovations that might include multiple health products (eg, diagnostics and therapeutics) along with new workforce and business models to unlock the full potential of innovations and enable sustainable scale-up.</p><p id="para360">We observed that certain characteristics influence the time needed for launch and scale-up, providing funders and developers with a roadmap to optimise planning for product development and ecosystem development. For example, while the needs to increase the research and development for maternal conditions has been well documented,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> we observed that only a limited number of products for maternal conditions have reached 20% of the target population. Specific contextual factors and barriers, including the lack of a centralised purchaser, the need to change the behaviour or preferences of end users, and the scarcity of skilled providers, need to be addressed comprehensively and simultaneously to enable health products to reach broader populations.</p><p id="para370">The massive investments and urgent partnerships in response to the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted opportunities to streamline and accelerate the pathway from development to implementation.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Investments by national regulatory agencies to achieve similar efficiency gains for other products during non-emergency conditions could substantially reduce the time needed to show proof of concept and therefore accelerate the launch of health products. Additionally, enhancing regulatory capacities and harmonisation at national, regional, and global levels can improve access to health products in LMICs.</p><p id="para380">Our analysis identified barriers and facilitators that could also be of value in decision making by investors, developers, and regulators. We found products developed by academic institutions, non-governmental organisations, or public&#x02013;private partnerships are slower to launch than those developed by private companies, which aligns with other qualitative evidence.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Our results also show that products with consumer or institutional markets and decentralised purchasing channels launch and scale up faster than products with global markets and centralised purchasing channels although previous evidence found mixed views.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Although certain elements of both centralisation and decentralisation could be valuable to product procurement systems, our results support the notion that procurement at a national or local, rather than global level could lessen the time needed to launch products. Additional research is needed to confirm these findings. Downstream factors, such as product demand, distribution, and delivery, and the capacity of health systems, have played an increasing role in scaling up and should be better tracked and planned.</p><p id="para390">We highlight several limitations that have implications for future research. First, not all products available in LMICs have been included in this study. Most included products were launched in at least one LMIC. Considering the high rate of failure across product research and development (ie, 7&#x000b7;9% of all candidates from phase 1 trials got approved in the USA, and 7&#x02013;45% in Europe),<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> learning from failed products might generate additional insights. Second, our analysis relied on publicly available data and measurable indicators. For instance, the sales or procurement information of health products is normally not publicly available. The missing data might affect the overall assessment on timeline and the factors associated with faster or slower timelines. Better data capture and public data sharing should be encouraged across different stakeholders such as manufactures and suppliers. Another example of a data limitation is the fact that we were only able to find five products that attained 80% scale-up, and less than half of the included products have information on 20% scale-up in LMICs (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 15</xref>). This evidence gap needs to be addressed for better understanding of the barriers to scale up. A publicly accessible database that prospectively tracks the end-to-end scale-up of health products, with a standardised set of global and country milestones and characteristics, could provide robust evidence to reduce the time needed to bring new products to users. Finally, our study considered only individual products, thus the bundling or integration of products across the care continuum could be another area for further study. Even with these limitations, this study provides valuable evidence to inform decision making in the research, development, regulation, launch, and scale-up of health products.</p><sec id="cesec90"><title>Contributors</title></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="cesec100"><title>Data sharing</title><p>All data presented is available from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://launchandscalefaster.org/" id="interrefs12">Launch and Scale Speedometer website</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="conflict-of-interest"><title>Declaration of interests</title></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</collab></person-group><article-title>GBD results</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results" id="interrefs10">https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooke</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Silimperi</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Urli Hodges</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Ortiz</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Udayakumar</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Scaling malaria interventions: bottlenecks to malaria elimination</article-title><source>BMJ Glob Health</source><volume>8</volume><year>2023</year><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">e013378</object-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>WHO</collab></person-group><article-title>World malaria report 2024</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports/world-malaria-report-2024" id="interrefs20">https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports/world-malaria-report-2024</ext-link><year>Dec 11, 2024</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref40"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jamison</surname><given-names>DT</given-names></name><name><surname>Summers</surname><given-names>LH</given-names></name><name><surname>Alleyne</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Global health 2035: a world converging within a generation</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>382</volume><year>2013</year><fpage>1898</fpage><lpage>1955</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24309475</pub-id>
