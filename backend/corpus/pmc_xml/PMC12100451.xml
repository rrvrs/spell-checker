Few states maintain databases for tracking patients who receive care at LTCFs,<sup><xref rid="zoi250403r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and most hospitals do not formally assess patients for LTCF exposure (eg, via intake screening). Moreover, most LTCF patients do not have an LTCF admission source coded in the electronic health record (EHR) for their admission; many do not have recent discharges to LTCFs recorded either.<sup><xref rid="zoi250403r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi250403r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Instead, clinicians often document LTCF exposure within the history and physical (H&#x00026;P) note.<sup><xref rid="zoi250403r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, because H&#x00026;P notes are free-text (ie, unstructured), absent manual medical record review, which is resource-intensive and cannot be incorporated into automated algorithms, or natural language processing (NLP) techniques for analyzing free-text data, this LTCF information has historically been unusable.</p><p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI)&#x02013;based large language models (LLMs) offer a promising, emerging alternative to manual medical record review and traditional natural language processing. LLMs excel at analyzing free-text data, and they offer several practical advantages compared with traditional NLP, namely, that they require minimal data preprocessing and can provide justifications for classifications. However, LLMs raise new challenges, including stochastic outputs and the potential for factual errors.<sup><xref rid="zoi250403r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi250403r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi250403r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Additionally, data evaluating LLM performance on the complexity of clinical notes containing protected health information (PHI), not deidentified or curated data sources, remain extremely limited.

The first cohort (UMMS cohort) included randomly sampled, unique adult admissions from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2021, across 12 acute care hospitals in the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS). UMMS hospitals are distributed across the state of Maryland. The second cohort (Hopkins cohort<italic>)</italic> included randomly sampled, unique adult admissions from July 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, among patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) during hospitalization at The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. Both sites use Epic EHRs, and for each included admission we extracted the admission H&#x00026;P note and patient demographic and hospital data. The University of Maryland School of Medicine and The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine institutional review boards approved this study, with a waiver of informed consent due to the impracticality of contacting the large number of patients as well as the time interval between the study and the original admissions.

At Hopkins, notes were reviewed individually (P.B.-V., S.F., N.K., J.H.L., and A.H.V.). Reviewers maintained logs to record note review times and met regularly to discuss and adjudicate uncertainties.

However, the LLM&#x02019;s rationale did not note the statement about the patient living at home.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="H2-9-ZOI250403"><title>Resource Utilization for Human vs LLM Review</title><p>Human review of the H&#x00026;P notes took a mean of 2.5 minutes per note at both sites. At $15 to $20 hourly pay for research assistants, the cost of human review averaged $0.63 to $0.83 per note, excluding employer taxes, onboarding, and training time. LLM computing is charged by the number of input (prompt&#x02009;+&#x02009;H&#x00026;P note) and output (LTCF classification&#x02009;+&#x02009;rationale) tokens, and had a mean cost of $0.03 per note at both UMMS and Hopkins. LLM computing time had a mean time of 5.8 seconds per note at UMMS and 4.2 to 4.4 seconds per note at Hopkins (<xref rid="zoi250403t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Taken together, the LLM was more than 25 times faster and 20 times less expensive than human review for classifying LTCF exposure from the H&#x00026;P note.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-4-ZOI250403"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate LLMs for ascertaining LTCF exposure from clinical notes and one of the only multisite LLM evaluations on PHI-containing patient data. Across a diverse, multicenter cohort of patients admitted to 13 hospitals between 2016 and 2021, an off-the-shelf LLM accurately identified LTCF exposure from H&#x00026;P notes even without dedicated pretraining for this task. Moreover, the LLM&#x02019;s rationales for LTCF classifications were accurate and cogent, and the LLM was substantially faster and cheaper than human review. Taken together, these findings suggest that LLMs could substantially improve the identification of LTCF-exposed inpatients to combat the spread of antimicrobial resistance in US hospitals.</p><p>We designed our evaluation to provide evidence relevant to practicing clinicians and hospital epidemiologists. Therefore, because most institutions have not manually reviewed notes for LTCF exposure, we first evaluated the LLM using a zero-shot learning and prompting approach, in which neither the LLM nor the prompt was fine-tuned or otherwise refined on training examples. In this first-pass assessment, the LLM achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 98%, respectively, at UMMS and 96% and 93%, respectively, at Hopkins. Reviewing the LLM errors at UMMS and revising the prompt further improved accuracy on the Hopkins cohort (applying the revised prompt to UMMS data would have artificially improved performance, akin to overfitting for traditional prediction models). Nevertheless, sensitivity and specificity remained lower on the Hopkins cohort, even after revision. It is possible that site differences in population and disparate model versions contributed to this performance differential. However, the most likely reason was an imperfect criterion standard, because we found that 35 of 41 LLM responses that were marked as false positives at Hopkins were actually correct classifications. Had we adjusted LLM performance estimates for these human errors, LLM specificity would have exceeded the 96% reported.</p><p>Beyond a yes-or-no LTCF classification, we prompted the LLM to provide the reasoning for the decision and text from the note to support the rationale. Across 117 rationales that were manually reviewed, all were factually correct, and all note text was quoted accurately. More surprising, however, was that these rationales included statements consistent with inferential logic. The LLM used contextual details (location of injury, presence of caregiver at awakening) to make logical conclusions about whether the patient had recent LTCF exposure.</p><p>Whether the LLM was reasoning when producing its rationales is a question of academic controversy,<sup><xref rid="zoi250403r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="zoi250403r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and more research across a larger set of rationales is warranted. Yet notwithstanding these caveats, we envision rationales becoming an important component of LLM deployments. Even highly accurate LLMs will make errors, and rationales enable users to understand why the LLM made mistakes and what its operating assumptions were. Moreover, even when programs maintain some manual review, LLM-provided classifications and rationales could streamline processes and reduce errors. When LLMs demonstrate high sensitivity and negative predictive values, as occurred in this study, they could perform first-pass reviews to winnow the records requiring human assessment. Similarly, even for fully manual reviews, LLMs could offer a parallel review to catch human mistakes, with human adjudication of discrepancies. In both instances, we expect appropriately validated rationales would accelerate these reviews or adjudications, because we found it substantially faster to read LLM rationales&#x02014;effectively, high-level note summaries&#x02014;compared with full notes.</p><sec id="H2-10-ZOI250403"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>As a multicenter study spanning multiple years, health care systems, hospitals, and general inpatient and ICU cohorts, our study benefitted from a large, diverse sample to evaluate LLM performance and increase study generalizability. Our use of PHI-containing notes, rare in the LLM literature, was also essential, because notes may reference LTCFs by proper facility names (which are removed during deidentification).</p><p>However, our study is also subject to several limitations. First, we only evaluated 1 LLM that our institutions have approved for secure deployment and did not use methods that could further improve performance, such as fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation.<sup><xref rid="zoi250403r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Evaluating a broader suite of LLMs and prompting techniques would be an important area of future research, as would evaluation in different geographic regions. Second, we could not evaluate the same LLM version at each site because of technical limitations, although both were versions of the same model and thus unlikely to be a substantial contributor to site performance differences. Third, because of cost and resource limitations, each note at Hopkins was only reviewed by a single research assistant, which likely led to a higher rate of human error but demonstrates the practical potential of LLMs for identifying human mistakes. Fourth, this study evaluated whether LLMs could identify LTCF exposure from H&#x00026;P notes, but because H&#x00026;P notes have high specificity but imperfect sensitivity for LTCF exposure,<sup><xref rid="zoi250403r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi250403r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> both human and LLM review will have missed LTCF-exposed patients whose notes did not mention LTCF exposure. Future work is planned to evaluate additional EHR data sources and to quantify how much LLM-extracted risk factors improve detection of colonized patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI250403"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Across 13 hospitals in 2 independent health care systems, we found that LLMs were accurate, fast, and inexpensive for identifying LTCF-exposed patients from admission histories. Although further validation across additional institutions is needed, we view LLMs as a highly promising strategy for extracting this important antimicrobial resistance risk factor from free-text EHR data. At both UMMS and Hopkins, this analysis represented the first large-scale analysis of LLMs on identifiable patient notes. As more institutions implement LLMs within Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act&#x02013;compliant, secure computing environments, the feasibility of this approach across US hospitals will increase.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI250403"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi250403r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><collab>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)</collab></person-group>. <source>Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2019</source>. <publisher-name>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</publisher-name>; <year>2019</year>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.15620/cdc:82532</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="zoi250403r2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name><surname>Morris</surname>
