This situation becomes more alarming since no approved drug exists to combat the virus. The present research aims to demonstrate the anti-CHIKV activity of molecules present in the latex of <italic toggle="yes">Euphorbia grandicornis</italic>. Therefore, a biodirected assay was carried out to find the molecules with anti-CHIKV activity. Extractions with hexane, dichloromethane, and methanol and subsequent purification by column chromatography were carried out to later evaluate cytotoxic activity by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and antiviral activity by plaque assay. Our findings show that unlike the others, methanolic extract has a low cytotoxic effect and a good anti-CHIKV effect (EC<sub>50</sub> = 26.41 &#x000b5;g/mL), which increases when obtaining the purified active fraction (pAFeg1) (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.4835 &#x000b5;g/mL). Time-of-addition suggests that the possible mechanism of action of pAFeg1 could be inhibiting any of the non-structural proteins of CHIKV. In addition, both the cytotoxic and anti-CHIKV activity of pAFeg1 demonstrate selectivity since it killed cancer cells and could not inhibit DENV2.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chikungunya virus</kwd><kwd>antiviral</kwd><kwd>cytotoxic</kwd><kwd>selectivity</kwd><kwd>cancer cells</kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Euphorbia grandicornis</italic></kwd><kwd>latex</kwd><kwd>oleanolic acid</kwd><kwd>roburic acid</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Secretar&#x000ed;a de Investigaci&#x000f3;n y Posgrado from Instituto Polit&#x000e9;cnico Nacional</funding-source><award-id>SIP-20242187</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by Secretar&#x000ed;a de Investigaci&#x000f3;n y Posgrado from Instituto Polit&#x000e9;cnico Nacional, funding number SIP-20242187.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-16-01929"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA alphavirus belonging to the Togaviridae family transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. In urban regions, <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Aedes albopictus</italic> are the vectors that maintain the human&#x02013;mosquito&#x02013;human cycle, transmitting the virus causing chikungunya fever [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Since CHIKV discovery in 1952 on the Makonde plateau in southern Tanzania [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the number of cases of chikungunya fever has increased, spreading throughout sub-Saharan African countries to East, Central, and South Africa, and to Asia [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It was later detected in Europe, where it attracted worldwide attention [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In 2013, an outbreak of this disease was recorded on the Caribbean Island of St. Martin, where it began to spread to America, drastically increasing the number of reported cases, reaching more than 1.2 million in just one year in South America [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The potential for this virus to cause a pandemic has been recognized by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and by the World Health Organization, which includes this pathogen on the list for vaccine development and priority research [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although there is currently an FDA-approved vaccine [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], it is not yet widely marketed. In addition, there is no approved molecule to combat chikungunya, and treatment only focuses on attenuating symptoms that include high fever for 3 to 10 days, followed by skin rash, myalgia, nausea, and severe joint pain [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] through the use of medications such as paracetamol or acetaminophen, and non-steroidal and anti-inflammatory drugs. </p><p>Although it is not considered a fatal disease, in some cases, these symptoms are worse; in approximately half of the people who suffer from this fever, severe arthralgia and myalgia can be present for months and even years [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The potential of this virus to cause a pandemic and drastically reduce the quality of life of affected people makes searching for new molecules with anti-chikungunya activity essential.</p><p>One of the most successful strategies for obtaining new molecules with biological activity is the extraction from natural products such as microorganisms and animals (including insects), for example, the mold <italic toggle="yes">Penicillium chrysogenum</italic> which produces penicillin, an essential molecule in the history of humanity since it was the first antibiotic characterized and mass-produced, thus saving millions of lives [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the plant kingdom is the largest source of new molecules with applications in the field of medicine; even though multiple efforts have been made in the extraction of molecules from plants, the immense diversity and wealth of bioactive natural compounds coming from these are still insufficiently known [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Of 391 thousand known plant species, only the uses and therapeutic benefits of less than 1% of these are known. Even with this little knowledge, the use of multiple medications based on herbal medicine is highly popular around the world in various countries and cultures; it is estimated that 80% of the world&#x02019;s population still resorts to and uses treatments based on botanical medications [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>One application these new molecules have in the health area is to combat viral origin diseases. It is essential to increase efforts in this regard since new outbreaks of diseases caused by emerging and re-emerging viruses have highlighted the urgency in advancing the discovery of new molecules with virucidal or antiviral activity, and since, to date, there are few FDA-approved drugs used in clinics (oseltamivir, ritonavir, remdesivir, ribavirin, favipiravir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine) and for a large part of these, some viruses resistant to these drugs has already been reported [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Various extracts and molecules from different parts of plants, such as roots, stems, bark, and leaves, have been reported to have antiviral activity. Some secondary metabolites, like coumarins and alkaloids, have been shown to have antiviral activity against pandemic- and epidemic-causing viruses: avian influenza A (H5N1 and H1N1), ebola virus, and SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Euphorbia (Euphorbiaceae) is the third major genus of flowering plants, with 1836 accepted species. Approximately 5% of the species have no use in traditional medicine due to their immense diversity at the phytochemistry level, including molecules like terpenoids, flavonoids, and polyphenols, which also exhibit various biological effects [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The antiviral activity of molecules from species belonging to this genus has been demonstrated. For example, scoparone was isolated from the aerial parts of the methanolic extract of <italic toggle="yes">Euphorbia deightonii</italic> Croizat; this molecule demonstrated a strong anti-Herpes Simplex Virus Type-2 activity with a cytotoxic concentration of 50% (CC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.032 &#x000b5;M and an SI of 10.93 [<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Another example is <italic toggle="yes">Euphorbia hirta</italic>; patients diagnosed with dengue in Agoo, La Union, Philippines, used the aerial parts and leaves of this plant to apply orally or topically; there is evidence of its anti-dengue effect since this effect has been demonstrated through ethnobotanical surveys, in in vitro and in vivo assays [<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the anti-chikungunya activity of these genus plants, several species contain molecules that can inhibit the viral replication of chikungunya. For example, in a study in which ethyl acetate extract of aerial parts of <italic toggle="yes">Euphorbia pithyusa</italic> and molecules such as premyrsinol esters, myrsinol ester, premyrsinol, and dideoxyphorbol esters were isolated, all molecules had anti-CHIKV activity with different intensities ranging from an effective concentration of 50% (EC<sub>50</sub>) of &#x0003e;152 to 4 &#x003bc;M, with &#x003b2;-dideoxyphorbol ester being the molecule that had the better activity with a SI of 10.6 [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Another example is <italic toggle="yes">E. amygdaloides</italic> ssp. <italic toggle="yes">Semiperfoliata</italic>, from the ethylacetate (EtoAc) extract, elaborated with the whole plant, 12 jatropha esters were isolated; the molecule numbered 3, and an ester of 9,14-dioxojatropha-6(17),11E-diene showed the most significant anti-CHIKV effect (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.76 &#x000b5;M) [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the same way, <italic toggle="yes">Euphorbia cupanii</italic> EtOAc extract contains 16 myrsinane and premyrsinane esters and 4&#x003b2;-phorbol esters, from which 4&#x003b2;-phorbol esters have a selective anti-CHIKV effect in the sub-micromolar range (EC<sub>50</sub> CHIKV &#x0003c; 0.8 &#x003bc;M, SI &#x0003e; 12) [<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">E. semi perfoliate</italic> extract has two new jatropha esters and one known and three new 4-deoxy phorbol esters; from the last, only one had antiviral activity against chikungunya virus (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.45 &#x003bc;M) [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Molecules like diterpenes such as ingenol-3-mebutate were detected in latex extract from <italic toggle="yes">Euphorbia peplus</italic> in <italic toggle="yes">E. peplus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Euphorbia segetalis</italic> ssp.; pinea ingenol-3,20-dibenzoate was identified, finally, in <italic toggle="yes">Euphorbia pithyusa</italic> ssp. <italic toggle="yes">Pithyusa</italic>, the molecule 13-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-isobutyryl-12-deoxyphorbol-20-acetate, was detected. From molecules identified in latex, only 13-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-isobutyryl-12-deoxyphorbol-20-acetate and ingenol-3,20-dibenzoate can inhibit the replication of CHIKV, with an EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.7 &#x000b1; 0.1 &#x003bc;M, and 1.2 &#x000b1; 0.1 &#x003bc;M, respectively [<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Other diterpenes or molecules in plants from the Euphorbia genus may have a more potent SI in anti-CHIKV activity. </p><p>One little-studied species from this genus is <italic toggle="yes">Euphorbia grandicornis</italic>, a succulent plant native to Kenya, in southern Africa, that is used as an ornamental plant around the world; some research studies have described the phytochemical composition of this plant found in compounds like the triterpene alcohols euphol, tirucallol, euphorbol, and phorbol-type diterpenes [<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, some biological activities have been attributed to the molecules present in this plant. For example, phorbol esters such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, ingenol 3-angelate, prostratin, and two new phorbol esters numbered 3 and 9 can induce platelet aggregation with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 9.5 nM, 72.5 nM, 0.91 &#x003bc;M, 6.08 &#x003bc;M, and 5.04 &#x003bc;M, respectively [<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Another biological activity attributed to this plant is anti-proliferative. GRC-2, a 12-deoxyphorbol ester isolated from aerial parts, had this effect in cancer cell lines H1299 (lung carcinoma), MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 (breast cancer cells) but had a more potent effect in non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells, in which it decreases viability by 49.2% at 300 nM and induces apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in the G2/M phase [<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the same vein, another report mentions that the extract of the aerial parts and roots of the plant has molecules with a cytotoxic effect on some breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, HCC70, and MCF-12A) [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The last report about the biological activity attributed to this plant focuses on cytotoxic effects, mainly in bacteria cells. From the dichloromethane extract, the identification of 24 molecules was possible through the use of LC-MS/MS spectroscopic. Molecules identified as methyl 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate, &#x003b2;-amyrin, and &#x003b2;-sitosterol were cytotoxic to <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. </p><p>In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time the potential of molecules present in the latex of <italic toggle="yes">Euphorbia grandicornis</italic> to inhibit CHIKV replication. Our results show that these are molecules with anti-CHIKV activity with great potential since they completely inhibit virus replication in normal cells with minimal cytotoxic effect at concentrations higher than those necessary to inhibit viral replication.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01929"><title>2.

The latex from the cuts was collected in a glass container, left to dry in the shade for one week, and then refrigerated until extraction.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-viruses-16-01929"><title>2.2. Extraction</title><p>As shown in <xref rid="viruses-16-01929-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, from cuttings of aerial parts, latex was obtained and placed in a glass container, and latex was dried and scraped from the bottom of the glass container. To begin with the extraction, 200 g of the resulting gum was collected in a glass vial. The solvents employed were analytical grade and purchased from Arben Chemistry (Mexico state, Mexico). All solvents were distilled before their use. The first extract obtained was hexane (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>) extract; it was obtained by maceration, so 100 mL of hexane was placed in the glass vial that contained the gum, and the mixture was incubated for three days in agitation at 150 rpm. After maceration, the mixture was filtered, and the solid material was extracted again with hexane (100 mL per extraction), and in each maceration, the mixture was incubated for three days. This procedure was conducted twice. Hexane from three extractions was evaporated with a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain the crude hexane extract (HE) (63 g). Solid residues from this first extraction were dried, and the same procedure (solvent volume and incubation time were the same) was followed to obtain the dichloromethane (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) (76 g) and methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) (45 g) extracts (DE and ME). These extracts were kept in a glass amber vial sealed at &#x02212;4 &#x000b0;C until analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-viruses-16-01929"><title>2.3. Purification from the Extract Selected</title><p>The extract that shows more potent anti-CHIKV and less cytotoxic activity (methanol extract) (40 g) was fractionated by silica gel (Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico State, Mexico, high-purity grade) column chromatography. The extract was solved in dichloromethane&#x02013;methanol (1:1) and absorbed in silica gel; this was placed in an oven at 40 &#x000b0;C till the solvent evaporated. A chromatographic column (400 &#x000d7; 34 mm) was filled with 200 g of fresh silica gel and, on top, the silica gel that contained the dissolved extract. The mobile phase first used was hexane to obtain the fraction 1 (F1). In the same way, five more fractions were obtained: F2, F3, and F4 with a mixture of hexane&#x02013;ethyl acetate (EtAc) in the proportions 1:9, 1:7, and 1:1, respectively, F5 with EtAc, and F6 with methanol. The volume obtained for each fraction was 1.5 L. The solvent from each fraction was evaporated to dryness. F5 was the fraction that was more anti-CHIKV active and less cytotoxic, called active fraction (AFeg). A preparative layer chromatography plate (PLC) was used to purify the molecules with the anti-CHIKV activity present in AFeg; 200 mg was solved in EtAc and placed in PLC silica gel 60F254 1 mm (glass plate 20 &#x000d7; 20 cm, Germany) and run in a glass container with ethyl acetate&#x02013;methanol (9.5:0.5) as mobile phase.

Using as controls the titers obtained in each cell line to obtain the percentage of inhibition of replication when subjecting the cells to treatment with molecules present in AFeg, the following results were obtained: inhibition of replication was more effective in A549 cells with 59.3 &#x000b1; 3.9% of inhibition followed by HeLa cells with 54.6 &#x000b1; 4.2% of inhibition, and in normal cells, % of inhibition was less, with 52.4 &#x000b1; 3.8% in HaCat cells and finally, 45.4 &#x000b1; 5.9% in HEK293 cells. The results of the one-way ANOVA Tukey test, when comparing the titers obtained in the control with those of treatment, show that the inhibition in replication is significant only in HaCat and A549 Cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-16-01929"><title>3.3.

Also, a standard curve (<xref rid="viruses-16-01929-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>a) was made to infer the quantity of PFUs in the different treatments semi-quantitatively.

When the treatment was placed at 0 h, virus replication was totally inhibited. When treatment was placed 2 h post-infection (hpi), the number of PFUs produced decreased almost entirely; a 98.3 &#x000b1; 0.4% decrease was observed.

Discussion</title><p>Despite efforts made in the search for a vaccine against CHIKV and the announcement in December 2023 that Ixchiq vaccine (VLA1553) had been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], it is important to continue the search for new molecules with anti-CHIKV activity, since the vaccine is not currently on the market because it was approved through the accelerated route and it is currently unknown whether it could have long-term adverse effects [<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>One of the most important aspects to consider with new molecules with a biotechnological interest is the safety of the organism that will receive them [<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. So, the first point to test is the cytotoxic effect in the cells employed as models for the study. The first cell line to be evaluated was VERO because it is employed in various research focusing on the cytotoxic effect of novel molecules [<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and has several applications in the research into antiviral molecules [<xref rid="B36-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="viruses-16-01929-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, hexane and dichloromethane extracts contain molecules with cytotoxic activity capable of almost completely reducing the viability of these cells; this cytotoxicity could be attributed to molecules such as Stigmastero, (24R)-tirucalla-8,25-diene-3&#x003b2;, 24-dio, and Euphorbol, which, as reported by Kemboi D et al. in 2022, are present in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> extract from aerial parts and can reduce the cell viability of HeLa cells at 15.2 &#x000b1; 0.2, 18.8 &#x000b1; 2, and 50.5 &#x000b1; 11.3%, respectively, when the cells are exposed to 50 &#x003bc;g/mL of this isolated compound [<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. No previous reports mention which compounds could be present in hexane extract. However, it could be that some molecules in the dichloromethane extract are also in the hexane extract, which also gives this extract cytotoxic activity. In the methanol extract, these molecules are either not present or found in a low proportion, and the other molecules have a null cytotoxic effect at the evaluated concentration. Although VERO cells are a good study model for cytotoxicity, it is necessary to corroborate the low cytotoxicity in other cell lines. Therefore, dose&#x02013;response curves were constructed with ME in VERO and two other cell lines employed in cytotoxic evaluations: HaCat and HeLa [<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The absence of cytotoxicity in VERO cells was confirmed at the maximum concentration evaluated (100 &#x000b5;g/mL), and it was also shown that molecules present in this extract had a selective effect since they did not decrease the viability of normal HaCat cells, but in cervical cancer cells, HeLa, viability decreased significantly. This selectivity can be explained by the fact that one of the major hallmarks of cancer cells is an aberrant metabolism, for example, Warburg&#x02019;s and anti-folate effects [<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Another characteristic phenotype of cancer cells is the alteration of cell receptors, such as high glutamine uptake by an elevated expression of glutamine transporters and the overexpression of fatty acid-binding receptor proteins like ADRP, FABP3, and FABP7 [<xref rid="B42-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. All changes in a cancer cell cause a difference in this response with respect to normal cells to the same molecule. Our results show a selective cytotoxic effect on cancer cells, since in all the tests carried out, the decrease in viability was always more significant in cancer cells compared to normal cells, so pAFeg1, in addition to the desired anti-CHIKV activity, may have a double beneficial effect by selectively inhibiting the growth of cancer cells.</p><p>In the present work, the antiviral activity of molecules present in the latex of the <italic toggle="yes">E. grandicornis</italic> plant was analyzed. EC<sub>50</sub> and CC<sub>50</sub> values obtained with the methanol extract of latex demonstrate that molecules present in this extract are excellent candidates for use as anti-CHIKV agents, since when comparing these results with those obtained from extracts made with ethyl acetate and H<sub>2</sub>O from other species of the genus Euphorbia, they are similar and even better than those of some other species. The EC<sub>50</sub> values of molecules in the latex of Euphorbia species like <italic toggle="yes">E. maculata</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">E. biumbellata</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">E. dendroides</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">E. pithyusa</italic> ssp.

Even though ten extracts obtained from the nine species evaluated had an EC<sub>50</sub> value lower than that obtained in <italic toggle="yes">E. grandicornis</italic>, when reviewing the EC<sub>50</sub> value, only species <italic toggle="yes">E. maculata</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">E. umbellate</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">E. pithyusa</italic> ssp. Pithyusa had values like those obtained with <italic toggle="yes">E. grandicornis</italic> (&#x0003e;100 &#x000b5;g/mL). </p><p>In the evaluation of fractions obtained from the methanol extract, we observed that with fractions 1 and 6, the viability or % of PFU did not significantly decrease with respect to the control group; therefore, in these fractions, molecules with neither of the two activities evaluated were obtained. With fractions 2 and 3, the percentage of PFU decreased significantly. However, this also occurred with the viability of cells; therefore, we can infer that in these fractions, there was a greater quantity of molecules with cytotoxic activity, and the decrease in the % of PFU was due to cell death since there were no cells in which the virus could replicate, so there would be a smaller quantity of viral particles produced. Finally, in fractions 4 and 5, cell viability did not decrease significantly, but the PFU% was much lower compared to the control group, which means that the molecule(s) responsible for the anti-CHIKV activity were present in these fractions. In addition, 0% PFU could be observed only in fraction 5, so it was in this fraction where the highest concentration of molecules with desired activity was found. </p><p>Throughout the CHIKV replication cycle, viral particles are capable of inhabiting and/or replicating in multiple types of cells, from the cells of the transmission vector Aedes genus to other genera and species of mosquitoes, non-mosquito arthropods, vertebrate animal hosts as non-human primates (NHPs), and of course, humans. Particularly in humans, it has been reported that CHIKV has a tropism for multiple body cells, such as blood cells, muscles, joints, bones, and the nervous system [<xref rid="B43-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our results show that CHIKV replication was indeed carried out in all the cell lines we evaluated. The fact that the virus was able to replicate in all cell lines is explained by the presence of the molecules that this virus uses as a receptor, such as the Prohibitin 1 protein (PHB1) and Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are present in different cell lines [<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Although CHIKV replication was carried out in all cell lines evaluated, it is noticeable that there was a difference in the titers obtained with these; HeLa and HaCat cells were the ones in which a higher titer was obtained, followed by HEK293. The cells in which a lower titer was observed are A549; this may be explained by the fact that these cells, when interacting with viruses such as the respiratory syncytial virus, increase the activation of genes upregulated by IFN-a and IFN-g, giving rise to a more potent antiviral state [<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown that this cell line has a restrictive behavior against infections by some alphaviruses, such as the Sindbis virus, the Eastern equine encephalitis virus, and CHIKV [<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. When subjecting the cells to treatment with AFeg, the percentage of inhibition was very similar in all cell lines. No significant difference was obtained between them, which shows us that the effectiveness of the antiCHIKV effect does not depend on the cell line used, suggesting that molecules with this activity act directly on any of the structural or nonstructural proteins of the virus since the molecular differences between these cells do not affect the capacity to inhibit viral replication, establishing the possibility that these molecules could serve to combat this virus, regardless of the organ or tissue that it is affecting. The effectiveness of the antiviral activity of pAFeg1 was evaluated using the human keratinocyte cell line HaCat since skin cells are the first cells to have contact with CHIKV. In addition, these cells represent a good model for CHIKV replication, making them a good tool for studying the mechanism of CHIKV transmission in the skin and preventing the spread of this virus to other organs [<xref rid="B47-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The cytotoxic effect of molecules present in pAFeg1 was achieved at very high concentrations (80 &#x000b5;g/mL) compared to the concentration necessary to inhibit virus replication (2 &#x000b5;g/mL) completely; it shows that concentrations necessary for the desired effect do not represent a risk for HaCat cells and as evaluated in extracts and fractions, for any other cell line evaluated, since the SI estimated (SI = CC<sub>50</sub>/EC<sub>50</sub>) for pAFeg 1 is 332.78, thus confirming this hypothesis. In addition, this SI value confirms the great potential that the molecules present in latex have, because an SI &#x0003e; 10 indicates that an herbal drug has the necessary potential to continue investigating its activity [<xref rid="B48-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, the evaluation of this activity was done using other techniques to confirm that CHIKV replication is inhibited by pAFeg1 molecules. It was decided to use qRT-PCR since this has proven to be a very effective technique in diagnosing CHIKV and evaluating virus yield reduction [<xref rid="B49-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The results confirm that pAFeg1 is capable of inhibiting virus replication. This inhibition is related to the inhibition of one of the stages of replication of the genetic material since dismantling was evaluated using nsP4, which, being one of the nonstructural proteins of this virus, is directly involved in the process of viral replication functions as an RNA-dependent polymerase and is a protein highly conserved in the alphavirus family [<xref rid="B51-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Since the number of copies of the gene that codes for this protein is reduced, it is inferred that the genomic material of the virus is not replicating, so it is ruled out that the mechanism of action of the pAFeg1 molecules is inhibiting any of the mechanisms of new viral particles release, since when this occurs, the quantity of viral RNA is not reduced since it manages to replicate within the cell but accumulates within it; such is the case of tomatodidine, a steroidal alkaloid in green tomatoes. This molecule cannot inhibit viral RNA replication once the cells have already been infected, but it can inhibit the release of viral particles [<xref rid="B52-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The mechanisms of action of naturally occurring molecules with antiviral activity can inhibit virus replication in two ways. The first is through a virucidal effect: the molecules alter or modify some structural characteristics of the virus. The second is through an antiviral effect: that is, causing some alteration in the cells that have been infected or altering the replication processes of the virus [<xref rid="B53-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Results of the time-of-addition test ruled out the possibility that the molecules present in pAFeg1 have virucidal activity, since no significant decrease in the number of PFUs was observed in the pre-infection treatment. On the other hand, the antiviral activity of pAFeg1 was confirmed since a marked decrease in the number of PFUs was observed when the treatment was administered at 0, 2, and 4 hpi, demonstrating that the antiviral effect occurs in the early stages after the virus enters the cells; at 0 hpi, the viral genome enters the cell and is translated by the host cell&#x02019;s translation machinery, thus giving rise to the nonstructural proteins nsP1, 2, 3, and 4. nsP2 is responsible for decreasing the translation of host cell proteins, giving priority to the translation of viral proteins, subsequently giving rise to the nonstructural polyprotein P1234 and forming the early replication complex, which is found in the evagination of the cell membrane, forming the structure known as a spherule, where the synthesis of negative-strand RNA is carried out, which will serve as a template for the synthesis of positive-strand RNA and subgenomic RNA [<xref rid="B54-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. When the treatment was paused at this point, viral replication was totally inhibited, which means that some of the molecules can interact directly with the nsP of the virus, thus preventing the replication of its genetic material and affecting processes such as replication and translation of the viral genome. It has been shown that the early phase of infection is given up to 4 hpi; we observed that just up to 4 hpi, a decrease in the number of PFUs is quite considerable; however, from 6 hpi, this decrease, despite being significant, was no longer so strong, and this fact can be explained since the replication cycle of CHIKV is faster compared to other RNA arboviruses obtaining on average the first virions at 5 hpi in cell lines of vertebrate animals [<xref rid="B55-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, in our results, it wa observed that from 6 hpi, the decrease in the number of PFUs was less than 50% since, at these points, the first viral particles had already been produced and infected other cells; however, there was still a decrease in the number of PFU&#x02019;s after this 6 hpi because, in the newly infected cells, pAFeg1 molecules again inhibit the replication of viral RNA. </p><p>Another interesting aspect of the molecules present in pFAeg1 is their ability to selectively inhibit CHIKV, since in the test carried out with DENV2, it was not observed that these molecules could inhibit the replication of this at concentrations in which replication of CHIKV was partially or totally inhibited and even at higher concentrations. This can be explained because these viruses, although they are grouped within the arboviruses, belong to different families (Flaviviridae and Togaviridae), so some aspects, such as the morphology of their virions, the interaction with their hosts, and replication strategies, are different [<xref rid="B56-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. One of the most relevant aspects regarding the differences between these viruses involves the differences in their nonstructural proteins. DENV possesses seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [<xref rid="B57-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and CHIKV only four; in addition, there are structural differences between these proteins, which can explain the difference in the capacity to inhibit the replication cycle of these viruses when in contact with the molecules present in pAFeg1.</p><p>This is the first report in which molecules present in the latex of this plant were analyzed for antiviral activity. In the other works, molecules from this plant were extracted from aerial parts [<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01929" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].
