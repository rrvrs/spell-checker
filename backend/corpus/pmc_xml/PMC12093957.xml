Historically, H5N1 transmission to humans has occurred because of contact with infected birds, and over 800 cases have been reported since 2003, with a mortality rate of 52%. Sustained human-to-human transmission of H5N1 has not been observed. HPAI requires physical containment and operational practices to be completed in a containment level 3 (CL-3) laboratory. To safely bring samples containing inactivated HPAI to CL-2 laboratories for further analysis, we tested methods of inactivation for downstream RNA extraction or antibody response assays. Samples containing A/dairy cattle/Texas/24-008749-002/2024 (H5N1 cattle virus) destined for RNA extraction were incubated with Buffer AVL (Qiagen) with 95% ethanol, or Buffer RLT (Qiagen) with 70% ethanol. Samples tested for antibody assays, serum, and milk containing HPAI were incubated with 0.5% vol/vol Triton X-100 at 60&#x000b0;C. We found that Buffer AVL with 95% ethanol inactivated H5N1 cattle virus in supernatant from infected cells, milk, blood, and urine. Buffer RLT with 70% ethanol inactivated H5N1 cattle virus in infected cell pellet, spiked milk, blood, urine, and tissue. Finally, incubation with 0.5% vol/vol Triton X-100 followed by a 30 minute heat treatment at 60&#x000b0;C completely inactivated the H5N1 cattle virus in whey and serum. This work is essential for allowing the safe transfer of H5N1 samples produced in CL-3 to lower containment laboratories for downstream analyses.</p><sec><title>IMPORTANCE</title><p>Historically, human infections from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have occurred from contact with infected birds, with estimated mortality rates of 52%. Recently, this virus has spilled over into many mammalian species and has rapidly spread between dairy cattle herds in the United States, causing multiple human infections after exposure to infected cows. Characterization of this virus is imperative for reducing risk to humans. Work with live HPAI virus must be undertaken in containment level 3 facilities, which limits the amount and type of work that can be done due to time-consuming biosafety procedures and lack of equipment. In this article, we outline how to effectively inactivate HPAI to enable safe work in containment level 2 facilities and facilitate more efficient work on this pathogen.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>highly pathogenic avian influenza virus</kwd><kwd>dairy cow H5N1 virus</kwd><kwd>inactivation</kwd><kwd>containment level 3</kwd><kwd>containment level 2</kwd></kwd-group><counts><count count="0" count-type="supplementary-material"/><count count-type="authors" count="11"/><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="31"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="7178"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>May 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of Eurasian lineage goose/Guangdong was first detected in China in 1996. Viruses of this lineage have rapidly evolved since then, reassorting with other influenza viruses and acquiring new gene mutations that enabled them to become panzootic. This lineage has been classified into eight clades (2.3.4.4a&#x02013;2.3.4.4h), based on these new genetics (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Clade 2.3.4.4b has spread globally and was introduced into North America in 2021/2022 during wild bird migration, causing high morbidity and mortality in poultry and wild birds (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>HPAI H5N1 has recently spilled over into many mammalian species including cats, alpacas, seals, and free-living mesocarnivores (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In March 2024, HPAI H5N1 was detected in Texas dairy cattle, subsequently spreading to over 500 herds in the United States (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The infected cows showed flu-like symptoms, including fever, reduced feed intake, thick, discolored milk associated with decreased milk production and high levels of virus in milk and mammary tissue (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). This unprecedented spillover event in ruminants underscores the capacity of HPAI H5N1 virus to further expand into a new host, as avian influenza virus infection has never been reported in cattle.</p><p>In humans, transmission of HPAI is typically from close contact with infected birds or dairy cattle, or contaminated environments such as farms or live animal markets (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Sustained human-to-human transmission of H5N1 has never been observed (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). As of 19 November 2024, the CDC confirmed 52 cases of human infection with the H5 virus in the United States in 2024, 31 of which were from exposure to infected dairy cattle, 20 from exposure to poultry, and 1 case in Missouri with no known source of exposure (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). All were mild cases with symptoms including conjunctivitis and typical flu symptoms such as fever, chills, coughing, sore throat, and runny nose (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In November 2024, the first locally acquired human case of H5N1 in Canada was reported (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Previous human case data gave case fatality rates of around 52% for H5N1; however, that may be an overestimate due to under-reporting of mild cases (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It is not yet clear whether the dairy cattle HPAI viruses are less pathogenic in humans, or if infections are less severe due to route and dose of infection (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). HPAI is classified as a risk-group 3 pathogen due to its high individual risk and low community risk, so work with HPAI is undertaken in biosafety containment level 3 (CL-3) laboratories (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Work in CL-3 laboratories is laborious for workers due to additional personal protective equipment (PPE) and time-consuming decontamination procedures, which limits the amount and type of work that can be done in the laboratory. Since CL-3 laboratories are highly specialized and set up for a specific pathogen or set of pathogens, and equipment cannot be shared between labs, it is not feasible to bring all types of equipment into the CL-3 laboratory. If samples in the CL-3 laboratory can be inactivated, it is therefore beneficial to transport samples to a CL-2 laboratory for further analyses.</p><p>Evaluation of viral RNA level by RT-qPCR is a sensitive and practical method for virus detection. For disease diagnosis, understanding HPAI tissue tropism and transmission route in cattle, and studying host response, RNA in milk, nasal discharge, blood, urine, and various tissues often need to be extracted for analysis of viral RNA level and host transcriptomics. Similarly, to understand the systemic and local immunity against HPAI H5N1, the antibody titer in milk and serum needs to be evaluated. In this report, we evaluated the ability of Buffer AVL and RLT, the two commonly used buffers for RNA extraction, for inactivation of HPAI in various body fluids and bovine tissue. We also evaluated Triton X-100 and heat-inactivation ability to inactivate HPAI in milk and serum.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Viruses and cells</title><p>Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK; ATCC #CRL-2936) cells were used for virus stock propagation and for viral recovery assays after sample inactivation.

Avelin et al. showed that Buffer RLT completely inactivated HPAI in infected cell pellet (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). A study with the Ebola virus showed that the addition of Buffer AVL alone did not completely inactivate the virus, but when combined with ethanol, the virus was completely inactivated (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). As the addition of ethanol to the sample is part of the protocol in both Qiagen RNA extraction kits, we tested the inactivation of the virus after the addition of both Buffer AVL with 95% ethanol and Buffer RLT with 70% ethanol as outlined in the kit protocols. The RNeasy kits are recommended for isolating RNA from cells and tissues, so cells infected with HPAI as well as tissue were used as test samples with Buffer RLT and 70% ethanol. We also tested milk, blood, and urine spiked with HPAI with Buffer RLT and 70% ethanol in case Buffer AVL and 95% ethanol could not completely inactivate the virus, since there are cells, protein, and lipids in this body fluid. The QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit is recommended for isolating RNA from cell-free body fluids, so supernatant from HPAI-infected cells, spiked milk, spiked urine, and spiked blood were used as test samples.</p><p>A lower Ct value in RT-qPCR corresponds to a higher amount of viral RNA; therefore, a decrease in Ct value within the detection range on day 3 compared to day 0 would show amplification of viral RNA, indicating the article could be infectious. Some samples such as supernatant from infected cells, spiked milk, and spiked blood treated with Buffer AVL and 95% ethanol, and infected cells and spiked milk treated with Buffer RLT and 70% ethanol started at a higher Ct value than the positive control. We postulate that after complete lysis of the viral particles and disruption of the proteins associated with the viral RNA (vRNA), the vRNA can flow through the filter membrane (MWCO 100 kDa) during centrifugation into the collection tube, which is the fraction that is discarded. However, if the virus particle remains intact due to incomplete lysis or incomplete dissociation from nucleoprotein, it can remain in the filter device concentrate, which is the top fraction of the tube that is used for the inoculum and RT-qPCR. If the viral membrane is disrupted without complete lysis, we postulate that the inactivated virus would also be retained by the filter membrane, which may explain why some samples such as milk, urine, and blood treated with Buffer RLT started round 0 with a Ct similar to the positive control, but show no replication upon passaging on MDCK cells. Standard curves performed with non-inactivated tissue, urine, blood, and milk show that our RT-qPCR can efficiently detect H5N1 in these samples, ruling out a technical issue. All samples treated with either Buffer RLT or Buffer AVL with ethanol increased in Ct values or remained above a Ct of 30 after all four passages on MDCK cells, and no CPE was seen in MDCK cells after any round of amplification. Buffer AVL with 95% ethanol from the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit led to the complete inactivation of HPAI in supernatant from infected cells, milk, urine, and blood. Buffer RLT with 70% ethanol from the RNeasy Mini Kit inactivated HPAI in tissue, milk, blood, urine, and infected cells. As the inactivation was complete, we showed that after inactivation, these sample types can be brought to CL-2 for the latter half of the RNA extraction and downstream analyses in our laboratory.</p><p>For inactivation of samples for antibody assays such as ELISA or neutralization assays, incubation at 60&#x000b0;C for 30 min with the addition of 0.5% vol/vol Triton X-100 was tested. The food industry pasteurizes milk at a temperature of 63&#x000b0;C for 30 min, and studies have shown that this completely inactivates milk spiked with a high titer of HPAI H5N1 virus (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). For neutralization assays, it is typical to heat inactivate samples at 56&#x000b0;C for 30 min (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). For our inactivation tests, we chose a temperature at a midpoint of those two temperatures, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 min, to test whether that temperature could inactivate the virus while leaving immunoglobulins functional. Triton X-100 is a surfactant that has been shown to inactivate a wide range of enveloped viruses by disrupting lipid structures, so we tested it in combination with heat treatment (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). As serum and milk are easily accessible biological samples in cows to extract antibodies for immune assays, serum and milk spiked with HPAI were used as test subjects for heat treatment with or without 0.5% v/v Triton X-100. Observation of CPE during serial passaging of these inactivated samples, as well as Ct values from RT-qPCR, indicated that inactivation was complete in serum and milk treated with 0.5% vol/vol Triton X-100 and incubation at 60&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Interestingly, the Ct value for whey as compared to serum and the positive control of serial passaging of stock virus was quite a lot higher at passage 0. RNA extracted from whole milk spiked with virus showed that our RT-qPCR system efficiently detects virus in milk (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), so we hypothesize that during the process of generating whey, the virus was lost to either the pelleted curds or trapped in the milk fat layer that was removed. In milk, fat exists as droplets coated in milk fat globule membranes (MFGMs). Triglycerides are produced in the endoplasmic reticulum of epithelial cells in the mammary gland, where they are coated in one layer of phospholipids along with proteins, sphingolipids, and cholesterol (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). When the lipid droplets are released from the apical side of the lactating mammary epithelial cells, they are encased in the phospholipid bilayer of the epithelial cells, along with carbohydrates, glycoproteins, and proteins present in the cell membrane, leading to a triple-layered globule (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). These isolated glycoproteins on MFGMs have been shown to inhibit hemagglutination of <italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori in vitro</italic>, and human MFGM-associated lactadherin inhibited rotavirus binding and infection <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, likely by acting as a decoy for binding, as removal of sialic acid resulted in the loss of inhibitory activity (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).

The presence of these glycoproteins on MFGMs may indicate that the influenza virus in our rennet-treated milk may be associated with the lipid fraction where the milk fat globules are located, due to binding to sialic acid receptors on the membranes (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). We also showed that the difference in heat treatment at 60&#x000b0;C compared to 56&#x000b0;C does not have a significant effect on antibody function in neutralization assays.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that lysis Buffers AVL and RLT with 95% ethanol and 70% ethanol, respectively, inactivated HPAI in infected cells, supernatant, tissue, and body fluids while leaving samples intact for RNA extraction and downstream experiments such as RT-qPCR or sequencing. Heat treatment in combination with the addition of 0.5% vol/vol Triton X-100 inactivated HPAI in serum and whey samples without affecting antibody integrity and facilitating downstream antibody assays. This analysis provided information to the laboratory intending to transfer samples from CL-3 to CL-2 for downstream analysis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank VIDO&#x02019;s veterinarians and animal technicians for providing bovine samples.</p><p>Y.Z.&#x02019;s research is supported by NSERC (Discovery grant RGPIN-2019-04578) and CIHR (FRN: PJT-166138 and 202309PPE-512254).
