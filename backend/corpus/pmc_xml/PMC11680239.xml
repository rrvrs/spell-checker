Prophylactic HPV vaccines have been recommended and have significant efficacy in preventing cervical cancer. Multivalent HPV vaccines have a better preventative effect on HPV-related diseases. However, there is currently only one nine-valent HPV vaccine on the market: Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9. The development of new HPV vaccines is still urgent in order to achieve the goal of eliminating cervical cancer as proposed by the WHO. Methods: In this study, we developed a nine-valent recombinant HPV virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine (HPV-9 vaccine) containing HPV type 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 antigens, with an adjuvant of aluminum phosphate (AlPO<sub>4</sub>). The type-specific L1 proteins were recombinantly expressed using <italic toggle="yes">Pichia pastoris</italic>, followed by self-assembly into VLPs. Immunogenicity studies of the HPV-9 vaccine were performed using rodents (mice and rats) and non-human primates (macaques) as animal models. Results: Immunogenicity studies showed that the HPV-9 vaccine is able to elicit a robust and long-lasting neutralizing antibody response in rodents (mice and rats) and non-human primates (cynomolgus macaque) models. The HPV-9 vaccine shows immunogenicity comparable to that of Walrinvax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9. Conclusions: In summary, this study provides a comprehensive investigation of the immunogenicity of the HPV-9 vaccine, including its immune persistence. These findings, derived from using models of diverse animal species, contribute valuable insights into the potential efficacy of the vaccine candidate in clinical settings.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>human papillomavirus (HPV)</kwd><kwd>virus-like particles (VLPs)</kwd><kwd>vaccines</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>protective efficacy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Ministry of Science and Technology of China</funding-source><award-id>2017ZX09308003</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM)</funding-source><award-id>18431905600</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates Foundation</funding-source><award-id>OPP1210446</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (ID: 2017ZX09308003).

Introduction</title><p>Human papillomavirus (HPV), a non-enveloped double-stranded DNA virus measuring approximately 44~55 nm in diameter, represents the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection. It has been identified that 15 types of HPV are associated with the development of various cancers, including cervical, anal, oropharyngeal, penile, vulvar, and vaginal cancers [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Notably, persistent infection with high-risk HPVs is responsible for nearly 99% of cervical cancer cases. Despite the global incidence of cervical cancer ranking third among women, with an estimated 661,021 new cases and 348,189 deaths in 2022, it is important to acknowledge that the majority of HPV infections resolve spontaneously without symptoms within approximately 6 to 24 months [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, a small subset of these infections progresses to cervical carcinogenesis, following a protracted evolutionary course encompassing HPV acquisition, persistent infection, the development of precancerous lesions, and, ultimately, invasive cancer [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recognizing the health burden, the World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed HPV vaccination as a primary preventive measure. In 2018, WHO called for the elimination of cervical cancer globally and, in 2019, proposed a strategy for 2020&#x02013;2030 [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Presently, six prophylactic HPV vaccines are available on a global scale. These include three bivalent vaccines (Cervarix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, London, UK, Cecolin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> by Xiamen Innovax Biotech, Xiamen, China, and Walrinvax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> by Yuxi Zerun Biotech, Yuxi, China) targeting HPV16 and 18, two quadrivalent vaccines (Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> by Merck &#x00026; Co., Rahway, NJ, USA and Cervavac<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> by Serum Institute of India, Pune, India), covering HPV6, 11, 16, and 18, and Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9(Merck &#x00026; Co., Rahway, NJ, USA), a nine-valent vaccine approved by the FDA in 2014, which protects against HPV6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Notably, HPV6 and 11 cause approximately 90% of genital warts cases. All of these vaccines are formulated utilizing the noninfectious recombinant L1 capsid protein, which is the major protein constituent of the HPV viral capsid. The recombinant L1 protein is produced through various expression systems, and upon assembly, it forms virus-like particles (VLPs) that closely resemble natural HPV virions. This assembly process confers the VLP antigen with exceptional immunogenicity [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9 was approved in 2014, as of 2023, only 27% of females worldwide have received a first dose of the HPV vaccine [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To meet WHO&#x02019;s cervical cancer elimination goal, the nine-valent vaccine production capacity must be increased, especially for low- and middle-income countries, including China.</p><p>We have successfully developed a bivalent vaccine named Walrinvax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, targeting HPV16 and HPV18. Walrinvax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> has demonstrated very good safety and immunogenicity in clinical trials [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Walrinvax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was approved by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in 2022 and received WHO prequalification in 2024 [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Extending this research, recombinant L1 proteins for HPV types 6, 11, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 were produced using the <italic toggle="yes">Pichia pastoris</italic> expression system. These proteins underwent self-assembly into VLPs and were adsorbed onto aluminum phosphate (AlPO<sub>4</sub>) adjuvant to develop a nine-valent HPV vaccine. This vaccine, comprising HPV16, 18, 6, 11, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 demonstrated comparable immunogenicity to Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9. Currently, this vaccine candidate is undergoing phase III clinical trials in China (NCT05580341).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-12-01356"><title>2.

To confirm the expression of L1 proteins, Western blot analysis was performed using anti-L1 mouse antibodies, which were prepared in-house, along with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) as the secondary antibody. Subsequently, the purification of L1 proteins was carried out using POROS 50HS cation exchange resin (ThermoFisher, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and CHT-II resin (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The purified L1 proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE with 12% polyacrylamide gels, and the protein molecular weight was determined using an unstained protein MW marker (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). Since L1 proteins possess the ability to self-assemble into VLPs, structural characterization was conducted using various methods. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) was performed using equipment from Beckman Coulter (Brea, CA, USA) to study the sedimentation properties of the VLPs. A differential scanning calorimeter (Malvern, WR14 1XZ, UK) was used to investigate the thermal stability of the VLPs. A dynamic light scattering instrument (Malvern, WR14 1XZ, UK) was utilized to determine the size distribution of the VLPs. Additionally, negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted using a JEM-JEOL microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) to visualize the morphology of the VLPs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-vaccines-12-01356"><title>2.4.

Upon three-time vaccination, the HPV-9 vaccine induced comparable antibody levels to Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9, inducing antibody values of 25,600; 7184; 32,254; 45,614; 7184; 18,102; 36,204; 36,204; 12,800; and 81,275 against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, respectively. In the Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9 group, the corresponding antibody values were 19,401; 4222; 33,779; 58,813; 16,889; 19,401; 29,407; 22,286; and 102,400 (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01356-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). The administration of the HPV-9 significantly induced antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies starting from 4 weeks after the first vaccination. Despite significantly higher titers against HPV types 16, 6, 31, 45, and 52 being induced by Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9 at week 4, the HPV-9 vaccine could induce comparable neutralizing antibody titers against all nine HPV types at weeks 12 and 26, with no significant differences being observed (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01356-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). These results demonstrate that the HPV-9 vaccine can induce immunogenicity comparable to Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9 in macaques, aligning with the findings derived from the use of rodent models.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-vaccines-12-01356"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Currently, polyvalent HPV vaccines targeting multiple HPV types have been approved for clinical use, with several more candidates undergoing clinical trials or preclinical studies. Among these vaccines, our HPV-9 vaccine was developed based on the bivalent vaccine Walrinvax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, which has been approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China, and the WHO prequalification was received in 2024. Compared with the bivalent HPV vaccine, nine-valent HPV vaccines can provide a wider range of protection. In addition to preventing cervical cancer, the HPV vaccine is of great significance in the prevention and control of a variety of HPV-related diseases, including genital warts, anal cancer, vaginal cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Most cases of cervical, anal, and oropharyngeal cancer are caused by HPV infection and the development of the HPV vaccine has led to a dramatic reduction in cases of HPV-related illness [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, further development of HPV-based therapeutic vaccines is necessary. For patients who have been infected with HPV, therapeutic vaccines can help remove the virus from the body and inhibit tumor growth [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>To develop the HPV-9 vaccines, recombinant VLPs were utilized as antigens. Prior to the adsorption of the AlPO<sub>4</sub> adjuvant, comprehensive structural characterization of the VLPs was conducted. Immunogenicity studies of the monovalent VLPs in mice revealed that even at a low dose of 0.02 &#x000b5;g, the recombinant VLPs were capable of provoking excellent humoral responses. Both binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against the nine targeted HPV types exhibited a dose-dependent relationship (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01356-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B,C). Overall, these data provide support for the development of the HPV-9 vaccine utilizing recombinant VLPs as the antigenic components.</p><p>The immunogenicity of the HPV-9 vaccine was assessed in multiple animal models, including both rodent- and non-human primate-based models. Vaccination with the HPV-9 vaccine three times effectively induced antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in both BALB/c mice (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01356-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B) and SD rats (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01356-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). Notably, the neutralizing antibody titers reached their maximum levels two weeks after the third vaccination, at week 6. Although there was a subsequent decline in titers, they remained at elevated levels for a prolonged duration (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01356-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref rid="vaccines-12-01356-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). Importantly, when comparing the immunogenicity of the HPV-9 with that of Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9 in macaques, the HPV-9 vaccine could elicit a comparable immune response. Although vaccination with the HPV-9 vaccine twice induced significantly lower neutralizing antibody titers against the pseudovirus of HPV52 at 4 weeks after the second immunization, the HPV52-specific neutralizing antibody titers were comparable to those induced by Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9 at 2 weeks following the third immunization. These results strongly suggest that the HPV-9 vaccine could provide high immune efficacy and excellent durability of neutralizing antibodies against infection of the nine HPV types, having effects comparable to Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9 and Walrinvax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p><p>The ELISA performed to detect anti-HPV antibodies (the results of which are shown in <xref rid="vaccines-12-01356-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) is based on HPV VLPs produced and expressed in the <italic toggle="yes">Pichia pastoris</italic> expression system. The difference in the response of Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9 to coated VLPs may arise from the use of a different expression system or a different L1 protein sequence. For these reasons, antibodies induced by HPV-9 vaccine may be more specific for coated VLPs than those of Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies are active ingredients that protect against HPV infection and are the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of HPV vaccines. Therefore, we opted for a pseudovirus-based neutralization experiment to compare the immunogenicity of the HPV-9 vaccine and Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9.</p><p>The neutralizing antibodies induced by the HPV-9 vaccine against the pseudovirus of HPV types 33 and 45 are significantly higher than those of Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9, owing to the fact that the L1 sequences of HPV 33 and HPV 45 pseudovirus used in this study were homologous to the L1 proteins contained in the HPV-9 vaccine. For HPV 45, there were 4 amino acids different from the relevant patent of Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9, of which the residue at site 357 in the HI Loop was critical for neutralizing antibody sensitivities [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Currently, the antigen sequence of type 33 in Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9 has not been identified. The L1 sequence of HPV 33 that we used was different from that of the HPV33 pseudovirus constructed by Richard Roden, which contains 6 mutations; the differences at sites 133 (DE loop) and 266 (FG loop) were critical for neutralizing antibody sensitivities [<xref rid="B24-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-vaccines-12-01356" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Except for types 33 and 45, other types of pseudoviruses share the same L1 sequence as Gardasil 9, so we believe these results are relatively accurate. Overall, the HPV-9 vaccine may provide effective protection against HPV infection.</p><p>Although HPV-9 comprises the same types as Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9 with the same dose of antigens, the L1s used in our HPV-9 vaccine are expressed in <italic toggle="yes">Pichia pastoris,</italic> while the L1s of Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9 are expressed in <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic> In the <italic toggle="yes">Pichia pastoris</italic> expression system, the length of oligosaccharide chains added through post-translational glycosylation is very similar to the structure of higher eukaryotes, resulting in strong immunogenicity. Compared to <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the <italic toggle="yes">Pichia pastoris</italic> expression system allows for higher expression levels and high-density cell culture. The <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> expression system is prone to plasmid loss and unstable passages, while all the expression vectors of the <italic toggle="yes">Pichia pastoris</italic> expression system must be integrated into the yeast genome. Therefore, the <italic toggle="yes">Pichia pastoris system</italic> has many advantages, such as simplified production conditions, lower production costs, and potent immunogenicity, making it valuable for various applications with significant market potential.</p><p>In summary, we have successfully developed a nine-valent vaccine candidate, the HPV-9 vaccine, which is capable of eliciting an immune response comparable to that of Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9. This vaccine candidate holds promise in providing protection against infections caused by the nine types of HPV and is currently being tested in a phase III clinical trial (NCT05580341). This large-scale phase III clinical trial will further demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the HPV-9 vaccine. However, the HPV-9 vaccine and the currently marketed HPV vaccine are prophylactic vaccines, which are mainly used to prevent infection before exposure to the virus and cannot be used to clear existing HPV infection. Unfortunately for patients who are already infected with HPV, such vaccines are not effective against existing infections and cannot reverse the lesions caused by the infection. Moreover, vaccines can only prevent HPV infection and the cancers it can cause; they do not provide a therapeutic effect for patients who have developed precancerous lesions or cancer. Therefore, in follow-up studies, we will continue to develop HPV-based therapeutic vaccines to help the immune system of infected patients clear HPV infection and reverse the lesions caused by HPVs. Therapeutic vaccines can also be combined with other immunotherapies to improve treatment effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-12-01356"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we developed a nine-valent recombinant HPV virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine (the HPV-9 vaccine). Our findings demonstrate that the HPV-9 vaccine elicits a robust and long-lasting neutralizing antibody response, effectively preventing HPV infection caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Moreover, the HPV-9 vaccine is comparable to Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 9, which is already available on the market. As a potential second-generation prophylactic HPV vaccine, this novel formulation holds promise in terms of reducing the financial burden associated with global vaccine supply. Of course, we will aim to further prove the safety and efficacy of this vaccine in phase III clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank J.-H.N. at NIFDC for kindly gifting pRFP and pCFP plasmids.
