These diverse goals span human social and economic activities including how we produce food and sustainable agricultural and forestry practices. The training of future agrifood professionals is key to reaching these goals and therefore agrifood education programs must have the appropriate educational content necessary to cope with these coming challenges, including with new market conditions and novel technologies (
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Charatsari
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The role of education and potential shortcomings in the transformation towards sustainable and resilient agrifood systems has been discussed in several research disciplines in the last decades. As early as 1993,
<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Newcomb (1993)</xref> proposed including leadership programs, extension education, agricultural communication and international development curricula to university agricultural education. Much of the current literature discusses the types of skills deemed necessary for facilitating a transition to sustainable the transformation and the difficulties arising in this process are explained on account of lacking the right type of skills.
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Charatsari and Lioutas (2019, 233)</xref> argue, for example, that, while &#x0201c;farmers exhibit high levels of empirically generated knowledge, they often lack the skills needed to adapt this knowledge into the new and complex circumstances which arise during and after conversion&#x0201d; to sustainable agriculture. They stress the importance of cultivating &#x02018;soft skills&#x02019;, including communication, collaboration, consultancy, and interpersonal skills (
<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, people skills, emotional intelligence, etc.). Other scholars have also identified network-building capacities (

<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Wezel
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), to name a few.</p><p>The complexities of a sustainability transformation have been widely acknowledged and several strategies have been suggested, including interdisciplinarity (
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Bryant
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), to develop systems thinking (
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Hilimire
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), experiential learning (

<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Valley
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). A systemic and holistic approach has been argued to facilitate transformative learning in farming (

<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Vietor, 2018</xref>). We can see how these new strategies have been implemented in education by the introduction of food studies (
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Hamada

<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Mann, 2019</xref>). Teaching and learning practices have moved beyond conventional pedagogy, towards more interactive and student-centred learning loops, including self-assessment (

<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Galt

The

<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). The inventory used four data sets; review of peer-reviewed literature, review of non peer-reviewed literature (reports, position papers) focus group interviews with professionals, practitioners and academics in the agrifood and forestry system, and a questionnaire survey. The results from the four data sets were compared to each other in order to identify the skills emphasized across the data. This resulted in three overarching sets of skills with subcategories (

The aim of the study was to get a quantitative and non-targeted picture of to which extent European agrifood education was already addressing and educating towards what the NextFood mapping has concluded was important future skills. We designed a web-scraping based informatics study, which is a practice that has come of age, at least in computer science higher education (
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Lunn
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), to answer two questions: Is European higher education in the agrifood and forestry sectors using vocabulary associated with the NextFood &#x02018;Categories of Skills&#x02019;? Are there differences between educations directed to different sub-sectors, i.e., agriculture, food and forestry? Our strategy was to collect texts from a selection of European Masters program websites, identify the programs involved in the sectors of agriculture, food and forestry, determine how much the description of educations are aligned with these categories of skills and in what context, and how they compare to Masters programs not involved in agrifood sectors. From these analyses we draw some general conclusions about the current state of European agrifood education at the Masters level and identify possible gaps to be addressed in future curricula development.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Choosing Masters programs to study</title><p>The study was limited to Masters programs (ISCED 7 level) since they are a relevant educational level for most businesses in the agrifood sector and thus of strategic importance. Further, the Bologna Process, started in 1999, has streamlined higher education in Europe by setting common, comparable formats for the structure and learning outcomes of Masters programs. Candidate universities were selected from the
<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.eter-project.com/" ext-link-type="uri">European Tertiary Education Register database</ext-link> (ETER), filtered on the following criteria provided by ETER: Presence of Masters-level programs, &#x0003e; 10% STEM students and active graduate-level research carried out at the institution. These metrics are defined in the ETER database documentation.</p><p>Masters programs from the candidate universities were considered for study if they were described in English, had clearly defined program structures, were physically located at the corresponding university and had at least one page of text. Webpages considered for study included the main landing page, any linked pages to deeper program descriptions, up to the first two &#x02018;student experience&#x02019; pages, course lists, pages describing specializations within the program and any program syllabi. Excluded pages included course syllabi, departmental pages, faculty pages, personnel pages and research pages not directly linked to the Masters program.</p><p>Once a list of candidate universities and their eligible Masters programs was compiled, they were grouped by country. Countries with few eligible Masters programs were excluded. The remaining countries were selected so that at least three countries were represented from Eastern, Northern, Southern and Western regions of Europe, respectively. While one goal was to include as many students in the study as possible by selecting universities with large student populations, several small universities nonetheless met selection requirements, including the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna Austria (BOKU) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Alnarp Sweden (SLU).</p></sec><sec><title>Web-scraping</title><p>The Masters programs included in the study were web-scraped, cleaned of HTML, headers, footers, sidebars and non-program related information using the programming language Python3.8 and the library &#x02018;BeautifulSoup&#x02019; (v.4). For the analyses, the texts were filtered to remove so-called &#x02018;stop-words&#x02019; (common words such as &#x02018;the&#x02019;, &#x02018;but&#x02019; and &#x02019;or&#x02019;) using the Python library &#x02018;NLTK&#x02019; (

However, most programs had less discernable titles, thus we identified the agrifood and forestry programs based on &#x02018;domain-specific&#x02019; keywords found in their website texts. Programs that mentioned &#x02018;agriculture&#x02019; and/or &#x02018;agricultural&#x02019; at least once in their texts were categorized as being associated, at least to some degree, with the subject of agriculture, food-related Masters programs were those using the keywords &#x02018;food&#x02019; and/or &#x02018;foods&#x02019;, while forestry Masters programs were identified as those using the keywords &#x02018;forest&#x02019;, &#x02018;forests&#x02019; and/or &#x02018;forestry&#x02019;.

size</title><p>Since there were clear differences in website size between Masters programs, raw counts of sector- and theme-related words from these website texts would have been problematic, since larger websites would have dominated the results, having more opportunity to use the targeted vocabulary, even though smaller sites might use this vocabulary more, relative to their word-count. Therefore, the study was carried out using normalized data, whereby counts of the sector- and theme-related keywords found in each of the Masters program texts were divided by the total words collected at the site. The 1303 Masters program websites, along with their normalized scores for the three sectors and the eight educational themes, are provided at the Zenodo repository (
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Burleigh &#x00026; J&#x000f6;nsson, 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Relations plot</title><p>Masters programs were plotted in relative proximity to their association (keyword counts) with each of the three sectors (agriculture, food and forestry) using Python3.8 and the libraries &#x02018;Matplotlib&#x02019; and &#x02018;NetworkX&#x02019; spring layout. Symbol size was based on the total number of keywords identified within the texts of each program. Programs symbols were colored by region (EEurope, pink; NEurope, Blue; SEurope, green; WEurope, orange).</p></sec><sec><title>Box plots</title><p>To compare the sector-related Masters programs (agriculture, food and forestry) to those not associated with these sectors, we grouped the agriculture, food and forestry programs into a single &#x02018;agrifood and forestry&#x02019; group, here termed &#x02018;AgFoFor&#x02019;, while Masters programs not associated with these sectors were grouped into an &#x02018;Other&#x02019; group. Hence, the &#x02018;Other&#x02019; group acted as a control, being comprised of hundreds of diverse, non-agrifood and forestry Masters programs and represented the current level of use of the vocabularies in question outside of the sectors of interest. Since the data was non-parametric (non-normal distribution due to most programs containing few keywords, while a minority contained many) as tested by Kruskal-Wallis statistics (data not shown), we presented the results in the form of box plots comparing median values instead of bar charts using averages.</p></sec><sec><title>Partial Least Squares analysis</title><p>To study the relationships between Masters programs using keywords associated with agriculture, food, forestry and the eight educational themes, a Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis was carried out using
<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html" ext-link-type="uri">Matlab</ext-link> (v.2019b), whereby the agriculture, food and forestry Masters programs were used as explanatory variables, while the eight educational themes were defined as the response variables. In the case where we use Matlab in our study, we provide a suitable Python replacement program in the online repository (
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">GML at Lund University, 2024</xref>). In the plot, positive relations are those variables that are located near each other, while negative relations are those opposite and on the diagonal to each other. Variables farther from the center of the graph have greater impact on the results.</p><p>Further analysis in the form of an Effects table using Partial Least Squares Regression with jackknife resampling was carried out to identify what relations can be considered significant in the PLS plot. For our study, alpha was set at 0.05 and the first three principal components were used. A positive relation (a &#x02018;1&#x02019; on the Effects table) for a given sector (agriculture, food or forestry) and educational theme (&#x02018;Innov&#x02019;, &#x02018;LifeLearn&#x02019;, &#x02018;Network&#x02019;, &#x02018;StratMan&#x02019;, &#x02018;Sustain&#x02019;, &#x02018;SysThink&#x02019;, &#x02018;TechKnow&#x02019; or &#x02018;Versatility&#x02019;) represents a significantly higher usage of vocabulary associated with that theme, relative to the two other sectors. A negative relation (a &#x02018;-1&#x02019; on the Effects table) for a given sector (agriculture, food or forestry) and a given educational theme represents a significantly reduced usage of vocabulary from the theme, relative to the two other sectors.</p></sec><sec><title>Validating our choice of keywords used to identify the sectors of interest</title><p>The study relied on a few select &#x02018;domain-specific&#x02019; keywords to label Masters programs as having some association with the sectors agriculture, food and/or forestry. For example, any program mentioning &#x02018;forest&#x02019;, &#x02018;forests&#x02019; or &#x02018;forestry&#x02019; was labelled as having some relation to the forestry sector. However, given that this strict labelling method might be too exclusive, we therefore validated our results by repeating the study using a larger set of objectively-derived keywords to see if similar results could be obtained. We did this by picking the top 10&#x02013;11 most frequent words (stop-word filtered, with minor edits to ensure uniqueness among the lists) found in
<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" ext-link-type="uri">Wikipedia</ext-link> website descriptions of each of the three sectors, agriculture, food and forestry. Thus, the validation test, as compared to the main study, used about five times more keywords and was based objectively on communal descriptions of the three sectors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Data structure</title><p>The words collected for each program were summed at the university, country and region level.

These Masters programs are relatively evenly distributed among the subdivisions, with the majority defined as &#x02018;food-only&#x02019; programs (10.0%). Programs involved in all three sectors, here labelled as &#x02018;cross-sectorial&#x02019;, account for 4.8% of all Masters programs. Most Masters programs (72.4%) studied, however, had no association with any of the three sectors.</p><p>A more in-depth analysis was carried out using a relations plot (
<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Here, each Masters program was positioned between the sectors of agriculture, food and forestry based on how many words they shared with each sector. Most programs were on or near the agriculture-food vertex, denoting programs involved to some degree in both agriculture and food, which is in strong contrast to forestry programs, which had fewer shared associations with the other sectors. It is apparent by color distributions that the region WEurope (orange circles) has abundant and well-described food and agrifood programs. The lack of balanced, cross-sectorial programs that have equal weights of all three sectors (programs located in the middle of the plot) is quite revealing and might suggest a relative shortfall of balanced agriculture-food-forestry programs in European higher education.</p></sec><sec><title>Agriculture, food and forestry programs relative to other programs</title><p>To determine the extent to which agriculture, food and forestry Masters programs use vocabulary from each the eight educational themes, they were compared, as a group, to all other Masters programs.

A clear, negative association can be seen between agriculture programs and the Network theme (located diagonally on the PLS plot).

Indeed, our filters removed Germany from the list of countries studied, despite their central role in European education, due to the relative underuse of English in describing many of their Masters programs. A more comprehensive polyglot study is technically achievable, but due to the added complexity, should only come after this initial study using one language. Nonetheless, this study sampled both large and small European universities over broad geographic areas and different cultural regions.</p><p>We identified interesting and statistically significant relations between agriculture, food and forestry Masters programs and their alignment with the eight NextFood &#x02018;Categories of Skills.&#x02019; However, our design does place limits on interpretation, since we only analysed the online
<italic toggle="yes">description</italic> of the Masters programs and not the programs themselves. A more in-depth analysis could include the study of individual course descriptions and syllabi within select Masters programs to better understand and quantify these relations.</p><p>A general conclusion from the study is that, at least when it comes to the discursive presentations of Masters programs, the agrifood and forestry education in Europe has already moved in the direction of sustainability, along the paths identified in NextFood. If we compare this with the statements in the literature review that certain changes are needed, Europe may already be moving in the suggested direction.

<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2016)</xref> argued network-building capacities to be important, but we found that agrifood and forestry Masters programs underused the associated vocabulary relative to non-agrifood and forestry programs. The most common words from this educational theme were &#x02018;communication&#x02019; and &#x02018;information&#x02019;, which on the other hand were among the &#x0201c;soft skills&#x0201d; that
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Charatsari and Lioutas (2019)</xref> recommended which may provide a good starting point for future discussions and curricula development to close this potential gap.</p><p>This study revealed or perhaps reiterated how dominant food-related Masters programs are relative to agriculture and forestry. Food programs were the most abundant type of agrifood program, had no obvious gaps in education as seen by the PLS plot and Effects table, had strong interdisciplinary relations with agriculture, and was strongly linked to the concept of innovation and technological knowledge. One concern, however, was the absence of the word &#x02018;hunger&#x02019; in any of the main or validation contextual tests, which is surprising given that reducing hunger is one of the prominent food-related 2030 Goals. Hence, our results might imply that European Masters-level education in the food sector might focus on food issues for the &#x02018;Global North&#x02019;, while limiting other global food-related challenges (
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The two other sectors, agriculture and forestry, were less center-stage than food-related programs. Agriculture programs were often &#x02018;agrifood&#x02019; programs, were associated with the theme Sustain, and commonly used phrases such as &#x02018;agricultural innovation&#x02019; and &#x02018;sustainable development.&#x02019; Agriculture may have a possible educational gap involving networking skills when compared to food and forestry programs. This potential gap is especially concerning, given that agrifood and forestry programs as a group underperformed relative to non-agrifood and forestry Masters programs in terms of using the Network-themed vocabulary. Forestry was strongly associated with the theme StratMan, but had limited cross-sectorial programs, few programs overall, and had a noticeable lack of keywords associated with the themes LifeLearn and TechKnow.</p><p>This study also showed that the theme Versatility as we defined it, is problematic. The associated vocabulary was not used often in the Masters program texts. While lack of use might be evidence for an educational gap across all the Masters programs studied, a closer look at the phrases involving the versatility theme showed that they were often contextless and uninformative, such as &#x02018;flexible competitive&#x02019; and &#x02018;resilience numerous&#x02019;. The few exceptions were &#x02018;ecosystem resilience&#x02019; and perhaps &#x02018;adaptive water&#x02019;. Such observations suggest that the theme Versatility might be a difficult &#x02018;Category of Skills&#x02019; theme to define and quantify using our methods.</p><p>We validated our method of identifying agriculture, food and forestry Masters programs by comparing our main results, which were based on a minimalist set of selected &#x02018;domain-specific&#x02019; vocabulary with the results from a second study that used a larger set of keywords not chosen by us, but instead indirectly derived by the academic community. We found that results were not substantially altered, suggesting that a few domain-specific key words were adequate for identifying our Masters programs of interest. This strategy avoids the creation of a long list of keywords that defines a given sector, but inadvertently adds subjective bias depending on who chooses the words. As for the educational themes, the &#x02018;Categories of Skills&#x02019; keywords were subjectively selected by members of the NextFood Project and we make no claim that the &#x02018;best&#x02019; keywords were chosen, nor even conclude that we studied all relevant categories. Indeed, it would be interesting to test other keywords, categories and concepts, such as keywords that might group &#x02018;soft&#x02019; versus &#x02018;hard&#x02019; agrifood and forestry skills.</p><p>There was much variation between Masters programs in terms of how much text could be collected by web-scraping, and this tended to correlate by country. As a result, we did not carry out any country-level comparisons and even our regional analyses were quite limited in interpretation. However, it would be informative to approach this study from a country and regional perspective, given Europe&#x02019;s geographic, cultural and educational diversity, if the technical challenges of a multi-lingual study can be overcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This article has demonstrated that a text-based, informatics approach can provide insight into the current state of agrifood and forestry higher education. It provides a foundation for fast and efficient diagnosis of how current education is aligned with policy goals. The results suggest that current education programmes are already using much of the vocabularies of the important skills for the future that was defined by literature and stakeholders in the agrifood sector. A notable possible exception was networking, a gap that can be addressed in future curricula development. This analysis can also be used as a starting point to study changes to European education over time. For example, conducting a new study in five or 10 years and comparing it to these results might provide fruitful trends. These follow-up studies can likely be assisted by AI tools that can process academic/scientific texts in different languages. Likewise, a breakdown of the control group, for example into social and natural sciences, could provide a deeper understanding of competences in other Masters-level programs. This study also emphasizes the importance for Masters program websites to use descriptive texts and relevant vocabulary when describing their educational resources and goals, as AI will likely use this data to assess some degree of program scope and quality. We addressed a number of limitations to our strategy including 1) unequal sampling of European regions, countries and their universities, 2) the analysis was based on the online
<italic toggle="yes">description</italic> of the Masters programs, not the actual course content, 3) programs differed considerably in how much text they provided online and 4) the keywords chosen to define our sectors of interest may not have been optimal.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and consent</title><p>Ethical approval and consent were not required.</p><p>The study follows the European GDPR guidelines.

The article presents an attempt to assess the alignment of the European Agri-Food and Forestry Master&#x02019;s Programme with the competence categories identified by the NextFood project through a data-driven informatics approach.</p><p> However, it suffers from methodological and analytical flaws that undermine its credibility and relevance. Relying solely on the descriptions of the programme websites is a weakness, as these descriptions do not accurately reflect the actual curriculum or educational outcomes. The selection of keywords in the article is a superficial approach to analyzing complex educational themes. By relying on a minimal set of keywords to represent multifaceted skills like sustainability, networking, or systems thinking, the study oversimplifies these concepts and risks misinterpreting their contextual relevance. For instance, words such as "collaboration" or "teamwork" are used as proxies for networking skills without accounting for how they are integrated into program descriptions or course content. Furthermore, the subjective selection of keywords, even when validated against Wikipedia-derived lists, introduces bias and lacks the rigor necessary for an objective analysis. This approach fails to account for the diversity of language, phrasing, and nuance used across different educational contexts, potentially leading to under- or over-representation of certain themes.</p><p> A more robust methodology would involve a broader and more systematically derived keyword set, validated through expert consensus and tested across diverse educational texts, to ensure accurate and meaningful results. The exclusion of non-English programmes introduces significant regional and linguistic bias, which limits the representativeness of the results.</p><p> Furthermore, the analysis of regional data is confounding due to uneven sampling and the fact that actual programme content, such as syllabus or outcomes, is not included in the analysis makes the conclusions speculative. Despite its limitations, the research lays a solid foundation for future studies, suggesting avenues for deeper analyses and long-term monitoring of educational progress in the agrifood and forestry sectors, while also emphasizing the importance of aligning education with global sustainability goals.</p><p>Is the study design appropriate and does the work have academic merit?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?</p><p>Yes</p><p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>Agroforestry</p><p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reviewer-report" id="report46057"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21956/openreseurope.20243.r46057</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer response for version 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Burbi</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name><xref rid="r46057a1" ref-type="aff">1</xref><role>Referee</role><contrib-id contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9035-7374</contrib-id></contrib><aff id="r46057a1">

It touches a very interesting topic, that is whether or not European agrifood and forestry Masters programmes are addressing the categories of skills identified by the project as necessary to face global challenges in the agrifood and forestry sector; and tests a text-based, informatics approach to obtain results. The rationale behind such a study is solid. The methodological approach is sound and provides interesting results from 27 universities in 14 EU countries. Concepts and skills associated with or contributing to networking and collaboration are the least found in Masters programme. More technical and applied topics related to agrifood and forestry sectors are addressed by a large number of programmes, suggesting the programmes are potentially in line with the technical requirements of courses targeting these sectors.</p><p> However, despite these interesting results, it is recommended that some elements of the study are improved.</p><p> Recommended revisions:</p><p> 1. With regards to data in English, it is not clear why the authors used the term 'agriforestry' when the widely used term is 'agroforestry'. A revision is highly recommended to ensure the correct terminology has been used in the study.</p><p> 2. The dataset available here:
<ext-link xlink:href="https://zenodo.org/records/10782379" ext-link-type="uri">https://zenodo.org/records/10782379</ext-link> is confusing.

It is recommended a note is added to explain the content of the data files.</p><p> 3. The authors rightly state the limitations of the study, in primis the use of only programmes described in English. However, the article also makes several generalisations about education in Europe inferred from the results of the study, despite having collected data from 14 countries only. This is rather contradictory. The discussion should be rephrased to avoid generalisations about the sector. The authors should ensure the focus remains on the testing of the text-based, informatics approach for such studies, which has great potential.</p><p> Additional comments:</p><p> - Article keywords should include 'agriculture'.</p><p> - Chinese characters are replacing quotation marks.

<bold>ABSTRACT</bold>
</p><p> Background</p><p> The NextFood Project (www.nextfood-project.eu) started work in 2018 to identify &#x02018;Categories of Skills&#x02019; that students should be equipped with to address the upcoming global challenges within agrifood and forestry disciplines, and involved concepts such as sustainability, technological adaptation and networking. This study is based on the initial skills and competencies mapping, but takes a different methodological approach. Instead of investigating what the research literature and professionals think are important skills for the future, this study asks how existing education programs include or exclude these skills in the description of their programs.</p><p> Methods</p><p> Python-based web-scraping scripts were used to collect texts from a selection of European Masters program websites, which were then analysed using statistical tools. A total of 14 countries, 27 universities, 1303 European Masters programs, 3305 web-pages and almost two million words were studied using this approach.</p><p> Results</p><p> While agrifood and forestry Masters programs were aligned with the NextFood Project &#x02018;Categories of Skills&#x02019; equal to or more often than unrelated Masters programs, we found evidence for the relative underuse of words associated with networking skills, such as &#x08216;collaboration&#x08217;, &#x08216;communication&#x08217; and &#x08216;teamwork&#x08217;. Agriculture-related programs used these words the least among the agrifood Masters programs. In contrast, agrifood programs used words associated with sustainability and system thinking more than the non-agrifood Masters programs.</p><p> Conclusions</p><p> The informatics approach provides evidence that many European agrifood and forestry Masters programs are following the educational paths for meeting future challenges as outlined by the NextFood Project, with the possible exception of networking skills. This approach allows a complementary and time-efficient overview of the current state of education in the agrifood system in Europe.</p><p> Keywords</p><p> agrifood, forestry, higher education, skills inventory, informatics, web-scraping</p><p>
<bold>Reviewer COMMENTS </bold>
</p><p> The article is about certain competencies that agrifood and forestry HE students should have after graduation. The study, based on website descriptions of programmes, is highly relevant and up-to-date. Data and methods are innovative and mainly very clearly and illustratively described. Results showing differences between program types and relations between programs are excellent and useful. My main concern is about selection of data and its description in the report and external data source.</p><p> Abstract has some typos with wrong characters (both in online and pdf version): &#x0201c;networking skills, such as -</p><p> &#x08216;collaboration&#x08217;, &#x08216;communication&#x08217; and &#x08216;teamwork&#x08217;. Agriculturerelated&#x0201d;</p><p> Please correct these to &#x0201c; or leave with any character, the meaning is also clear without quotation mark &#x0201c; symbol.</p><p> Keywords should include &#x0201c;agriculture&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;food&#x0201d;.</p><p> Method section describes how programs were selected: &#x0201c;Candidate universities were selected from the</p><p> European Tertiary Education Register database (ETER), filtered on the following criteria provided by ETER: Presence of Masters-level programs, &#x0003e; 10% STEM students and active graduate-level research carried out at the institution. These metrics are defined in the ETER database documentation.&#x0201d; Please, provide here some more details. What is STEM criterion all about? What does this mean &#x0201c;Presence of Masters-level programs?</p><p> Data is provided in the system called Zenodo.org,

There is a code &#x0201c;Deptype&#x0201d; which indicates programme type. This code includes, for instance, categories of agriculture and forestry. However, the classification principle describes on page 8, second column was &#x0201c;programs involved in agriculture, food and forestry Masters programs that used at least one word from one or more of the three sectors accounted for 360,&#x0201d;</p><p> Having a look on data I found that some program that have keywords in their web-text were not classified as any of three relevant categories (agriculture, food, forestry) using this &#x0201c;Deptype&#x0201d; variable. For instance, a program under &#x0201c;Ecology&#x0201d; had a keyword &#x0201c;forest&#x0201d; in its webpage text and must be thus one of those 360 relevant programs. However, to my understanding there is no code indicating that in website_data.csv. As mentioned in the manuscript (p. 8, second column) these programs covered 27,6% of all programs. Therefore, the datafile has mainly non-relevant information that makes it impossible to replicate the study.</p><p> Please, separate relevant data describing 360 programs out of full data (file website_data.csv) and &#x000a0;provide it online. That separated data should also has coding related to final relevant programs type: agriculture, food, forestry.</p><p>Is the study design appropriate and does the work have academic merit?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?</p><p>Yes</p><p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>higher education, pedagogy, forestry, forest education</p><p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reviewer-report" id="report47948"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21956/openreseurope.20243.r47948</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer response for version 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Henke</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name><xref rid="r47948a2" ref-type="aff">2</xref><role>Referee</role><contrib-id contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1677-0387</contrib-id></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mazzocchi</surname><given-names>Giampiero</given-names></name><xref rid="r47948a1" ref-type="aff">1</xref><role>Co-referee</role></contrib><aff id="r47948a1">

High level education in the fields of agrifood systems is changing rapidly, opening the way to multidisciplinary (and transdisciplinary) approaches, sustainability issues, resilience, and new systematic approaches. The article investigates Masters programmes, comparing those specific in the fields of agri-food and forrest fields with neighbor disciplines and similar non-specific ones.</p><p> I have only a few comments reported below:</p><p> 1) The introduction, in my point of view, does not present properly the topic and the bectives of the paper and remains quite generic, also ingenerating some confusion in the reader between the general issue of farmers (and other operators) education and training in agriculture with the specific issue of post-graduate agri-food secialistic masters programmes, which are not necesseraly and not often addressed to farmers.</p><p> 2) In figure 1 in the first circle I would refer also to transdisciplinarity as a new frontier of high level education, meaning crossing disciplinary bounderies, building a common language and vocabulary, setting common knowledge goals and integrating results in favour of the common more general&#x000a0; interests of science and society (see Morton et al. 2015 (Ref-1):&#x000a0;Architectures of adaptive integration in large collaborative projects, Ecology and Society, 20(4)).</p><p> 3) Figure 2B is not very clear and there is no legends about the symbols used.</p><p> 4) In my opinion the article is a bit too self referenced to the results of the mother project (NextFood), while there is not much discussion about the results and the evidence compared to other literature. I imagine there is very scarce literature on the topic, but a little effort in framing the results in the debate and literature would improve the overall value of the paper. The same issue stands, in my opinion, with regards to the relevance and the generalisation of the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Is the study design appropriate and does the work have academic merit?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?</p><p>Partly</p><p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>Agrifood system economics and policies; Multifunctional agriculture and diversification in agriculture; Rural development, Agricultural and rural policy; Sustainability; Food policy</p><p>We confirm that we have read this submission and believe that we have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however we have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="rep-ref-47948-1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">

My main comments are on the (structure and argumentation in) abstract and introduction, and on the methods section.</p><p> Results, discussion and conclusion sections give interesting and new insights! Conclusions, limitations and further research are well explained and described. &#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p><p>
<bold>Abstract</bold>
</p><p> In the background paragraph three concepts are mentioned: sustainability, technological adaptation and networking. Including networking in the background seems a bit like anticipating the conclusions, as the limited attention for network skills in agrifood and forestry masters is one of the main conclusions. Why not mentioning, short, all the seven skill groups. Then also the rest of the abstract becomes more clear.</p><p> The method section in the abstract is rather (too!) limited, important parts of the data analysis are left out (PCA, PLS,&#x02026;)</p><p> The conclusions section in the abstract gives very limited information. If the remarks on the method of analysis would be left out, there would be space to give more info on the results for the three sectors, and still the important remark on networking skills could be included.</p><p>
<bold>Introduction</bold>
</p><p> Sometimes next to &#x02018;&#x02019;skills&#x02019;&#x02019;, &#x02018;&#x02019;competencies&#x02019;&#x02019; are mentioned. However, these seem to not be part of the study!?</p><p> The future challenges discussed are not clear; is it about sustainable agri-food and forestry, or are also all kind of other challenges involved? The first part of the introduction section is rather vague.</p><p> Then relating to education programs, it is not clear how the specific skills mentioned relate to the challenges (sustainable production?). For example Newcomb (1993)?. But also how &#x02018;soft skills&#x02019;, networking, etc. relate to coping with &#x02018;&#x02019;the challenges&#x02019;&#x02019;? For the reader it is very important to know how the skills mentioned, here and further on, in the article help to cope with &#x02018;&#x02019;the challenges&#x02019;&#x02019;. Even a relative short paragraph could help here.</p><p> And also in the next section, what education for sustainability encompasses is rather vague, for example how the type of pedagogy applied relates to sustainability(?) education is not clear. (but this vagueness &#x000a0;in fact holds for the largest part of this paragraph).</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>
</p><p> The argumentation to choose Master programs should be improved. Also other agri-food and forestry education levels are relevant and of strategic importance (see e.g.
<ext-link xlink:href="https://eufunds.ie/european-social-fund/operational-programmes/esf-2021-2027/european-skills-agenda/#:~:text=The%20new%20European%20Skills%20Agenda,becomes%20a%20reality%20across%20Europe." ext-link-type="uri">de EU Skills Agenda, 2020</ext-link>).</p><p> Why in the selection of programs &#x0003e;10% STEM students?</p><p> On the selected skill sets, I would have expected a clear relation between figure 1 and table 1. Indeed, it is not transparent how you arrive at table 1. In table 1 soft and&#x000a0; transversal skills seems to be the focus. That these are of high importance is also found in many other studies, so it makes a lot of sense to include these. However, the technical skills in the list focus mostly on computer kills and ''general'' terms like 'technique' etc. Why haven't these technical skill be more specified: think of renewable energy, (value added?) waste management, biodiversity, valorization of by-streams etc etc. (and/or some of the concepts in figure 1).</p><p> It would have made sense to also make a rough divide in the &#x02018;&#x02019;control&#x02019;&#x02019; group of masters programs, as within this group there will be large differences (e.g. think on the differences between social and natural sciences). Nevertheless, the exercise as performed by the researchers does add to the study!</p><p> The way chosen to validate keywords (with Wikipedia) is creative. However, regarding the statement &#x02018;&#x02019; and was based objectively on texts that are generally accepted to be academic and communal descriptions of the three sectors&#x02019;&#x02019;, I wouldn&#x02019;t say that Wikipedia texts are (all) academic and generally accepted.</p><p>

This happens in the abstract and throughout the text. I think the reader is not really intrested in this and rather would like to see the background and objectives explained in the context of current literature, policy problems and gaps in research.</p><p> Even when mentioning NEXTFOOD itself, I think the authors should Put more focus on the contents of the skills expressed.</p><p> In the abstract, the authors could improve and enlarge the results with more details; this is the essential part of the exercise.

As an example, see the discussione on hunger: the current interpretation might work, but there can be others, for example that courses use a wording tending to give a positive feeling (solving problems rather than emphasising the problems themselves). In general this part is rather poor of scientific literature and I think digging a bit more on this would help a better intepretation of the results.</p><p> Also the authors seem not to considerr the different legislation among countries, that is actually a strong driver of course design.</p><p> I could not detect a proper discussion of limitations and biases, that is essential in this cases.</p><p> In the conclusions, I would expect a bit more on the topic and not only consideration about the instrument. To persuade that it is relevant (I am sure it is), I would suggest to spend more time in identifying a few strong insights on the topic.</p><p> Some deliverables from NEXTFOOD are cited.
