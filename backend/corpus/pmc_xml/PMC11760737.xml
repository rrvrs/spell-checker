However, in steady-state conditions, certain DC subsets, such as Langerhans cells (LCs), induce T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and B cell responses without inflammatory stimuli. Using multiple mouse models and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> systems, we investigated the mechanisms underlying steady-state LC-induced adaptive immune responses. We found that LCs drive germinal center Tfh and B cell differentiation and antibody production independently of interleukin-6 (IL-6), type-I interferons, and ICOS ligand (ICOS-L) signaling, which are critical in inflammatory settings. Instead, these responses relied on CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation. Our findings challenge the conventional three-signal paradigm by demonstrating that cytokine signaling is dispensable for LC-mediated Tfh and B cell responses in steady-state. These insights provide a framework for understanding homeostatic immunity and the immune system&#x02019;s role in maintaining tolerance or developing autoimmunity under non-inflammatory conditions.</p></abstract><abstract id="ABS2" abstract-type="summary"><title>SUMMARY STATEMENT</title><p id="P2">Langerhans cells (LCs) drive germinal center Tfh and B cell responses in steady-state conditions independently of IL-6, type-I interferons, and ICOS ligand, challenging the established cytokine-centric model of T cell differentiation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S2"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P3">Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical in training and educating na&#x000ef;ve T cells and their differentiation into specific T helper subsets (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Merad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al., 2021</xref>). Generally, it is widely accepted that the DCs provide three signals to na&#x000ef;ve T cells in the form of cognate peptide/MHC, membrane-bound co-stimulation, and soluble cytokines. Out of these, the cytokines, as third signals (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Curtsinger et al., 1999</xref>), are regarded as key components in T helper cell differentiation into T helper subsets, such as Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh cells, and others (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Hilligan and Ronchese, 2020</xref>). These distinct Th subsets are thought to be induced by the DC-derived polarizing cytokines specific for each Th subset. The Th polarizing cytokines are induced by exposure to various inflammatory stimuli sensed by DC through distinct pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002</xref>). This oversimplified model of Th differentiation provides a plausible explanation for inflammatory settings, but it is challenging to apply in a broader sense. For example, antigen targeting to different DC subsets in steady-state in the apparent lack of adjuvant and other inflammatory signals induces Tfh cells and antibody responses (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Caminschi and Shortman, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Corbett et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Lahoud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Caminschi et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, anti-commensal responses, termed homeostatic immunity, happen regularly in the absence of overt inflammation (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Belkaid and Harrison, 2017</xref>), justifying the need to understand better the induction mechanism of adaptive immune responses in this non-inflammatory context.</p><p id="P4">LCs, with monocytic origin but DC functions (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Ginhoux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Hoeffel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Doebel et al., 2017</xref>), drive Tfh cells and germinal center (GC)-dependent protective antibody responses in steady-state (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>).

However, the mechanism by which LCs support adaptive immune responses in steady-state remains elusive. Therefore, here, we set out to define the mechanism. We found that LCs induced Tfh and B cell responses independently from IL-6, type-I interferon, and ICOS-L, which were previously reported to play critical roles in inflammatory settings in driving Tfh cells and antibody responses (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Crotty, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Krishnaswamy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Crotty, 2019</xref>). LC-induced responses, however, were dependent on CD80/CD86 co-stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec id="S4"><title>LCs, unlike cDC1s, induce GC-Tfh cells and antibody responses in steady-state</title><p id="P5">We have previously shown using two mouse models that steady-state antigen targeting to LCs, but not cDC1, leads to GC-Tfh formation and antibody responses (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>). In mouse skin, Langerin expression is confined to LCs and CD103<sup>+</sup>/XCR-1<sup>+</sup> cDC1s (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan, 2017</xref>), and thus, we used two mouse models, huLangerin and Batf3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, to permit targeting antigen to either LCs or cDC1s. The huLangerin mice express human Langerin specifically in LCs (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bobr et al., 2010</xref>), allowing antigen targeting to LCs in the presence of cDC1s using anti-human Langerin (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Igy&#x000e1;rt&#x000f3; et al., 2011</xref>). The Batf3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice lack the migratory Langerin-expressing cDC1s. Therefore, the remaining LCs can be specifically targeted using anti-mouse Langerin (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2015</xref>). To further strengthen our previous findings and increase rigor, here, we expanded our toolset to include two other mouse models that were more recently generated by the Murphy lab, XCR1-Cre and IRF8<sup>32&#x00394;</sup>, both specifically affecting cDC1s (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Durai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Ferris et al., 2020</xref>). We bred the XCR-1-Cre to &#x0201c;STOP&#x0201d;-DTA mice to selectively eliminate all the cDC1s (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The huLangerin-DTA (huL-DTA) mice that lack LCs (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 2005</xref>) were used as controls for cDC1s targeting that does not induce GC-Tfh cells and antibody responses in steady-state (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>). The mice were then adoptively transferred with CD4 TE&#x003b1; cells and injected with 1 &#x003bc;g of anti-muLangerin-E&#x003b1; a day later. Four and fourteen days later, the antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and B cell responses were characterized using flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively, as described previously (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>). We found that LCs targeted in XCR-1-Cre-DTA and IRF8<sup>32&#x00394;</sup> mice, like Batf3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, induced GC-Tfh cells, in sharp contrast to cDC1 targeting in huL-DTA mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The B cell responses mounted in these two new models followed a largely similar trajectory to Batf3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice but were slightly less pronounced (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Interestingly, the IRF8<sup>32&#x00394;</sup> mice did not produce significant levels of antibodies, unlike XCR1-Cre-DTA and Batf3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). This could indicate that this IRF8<sup>32&#x00394;</sup> deletion might affect GC and plasma cell responses, as has been reported for full IRF8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Carotta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, these data further support our previous observation that LCs, unlike cDC1s, can induce GC-Tfh cells and antibody responses in steady-state, irrespective of the mouse model used.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Type I interferon is not required for the induction of adaptive immune responses by steady-state LCs</title><p id="P6">It is unknown how adaptive immune responses, including T follicular helper cells and antibody responses, are induced by LCs and some DC subsets in steady-state. Intact type-I interferon signaling in DCs is needed to effectively induce Tfh cells in inflammatory settings through IL-6 up-regulation (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Cucak et al., 2009</xref>). Targeted delivery of IFN&#x003b1; to cDC1 through Langerin enables these cells to support the differentiation of GC-Tfh cells and GC-dependent antibody responses (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>). Based on these data, we hypothesized that steady-state levels of type-I interferon signaling in LCs might play a role in inducing Tfh cells and B cell responses in steady-state. To test this hypothesis, we bred the huLangerinCre mice to IFN&#x003b1;R1<sup>f/f</sup> mice to delete IFN&#x003b1;R1 from LCs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The genotypes of the resulting mice were determined using standard PCR, while the selective deletion of IFN&#x003b1;R1 protein on LCs was confirmed using flow cytometry (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1 A</xref>). Cre-positive and cre-negative mice were then adoptively transferred with CD4<sup>+</sup> TE&#x003b1; cells and, a day later, were injected with 1 &#x003bc;g of anti-huLangerin-E&#x003b1;. Four and fourteen days later, the antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and B cell responses were characterized using flow cytometry and ELISA. The anti-huIgG IgG levels were determined using ELISA on serum samples harvested on day 14 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). We found no major differences regarding antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and B cell expansions and phenotype. The percent of Tfh cells slightly decreased but this was not reflected in the B cell responses. (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">B</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). The anti-huIgG4 IgG levels were also unaffected without type-I interferon signaling in LCs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). These data, therefore, point to the lack of a critical role of type-I interferon signaling in LCs in the steady-state induction of Tfh cells and antibody responses.</p><p id="P7">To increase the rigor of our findings, we used a blocking antibody against IFN&#x003b1;R (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1 B</xref>), which can address potential type-I interferon involvement in LC-induced adaptive immune responses in steady-state by acting directly on the T cells or indirectly through other cells. Again, we found no significant changes in T and B cell responses and a moderate increase rather than decrease or absence of anti-hIgG antibody levels (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">F</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Thus, these data strongly support that the adaptive immune responses induced by steady-state LCs are largely independent of type-I interferon signaling.</p><p id="P8">Next, we tested whether exogenous IFN&#x003b1; could boost adaptive immune responses above the levels induced by steady-state LCs. For this, we used an anti-muLangerin-IFN&#x003b1; construct we previously described that enables cDC1 to support antibody responses (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>). LCs, similarly to cDC1, express IFN&#x003b1;R (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1 A</xref>). We found that delivering IFN&#x003b1; to LCs did not significantly alter their ability to support B cell responses (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1 C</xref>). In total, these data show that either promulgating or diminishing IFN&#x003b1; signaling in LCs does not affect their ability to support adaptive immune responses in this targeting model.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>IL-6 is not required for the induction of adaptive immune responses by steady-state LCs</title><p id="P9">IL-6 in mice, according to some but not all reports, plays a critical role in supporting the differentiation of Tfh cells in inflammatory models (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Crotty, 2019</xref>). However, its role in Tfh cell and antibody response induction in a steady-state is unknown. Steady-state LCs, unlike cDC1s, contain high levels of IL-6 mRNA transcript (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>). Since LCs, but not cDC1s, can induce Tfh cells with germinal center (GC) phenotype (Bcl-6<sup>high</sup>) and protective antibody responses in steady-state models (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>), we hypothesized that LC-derived IL-6 might be essential in supporting the adaptive immune responses. To test this and limit IL-6 deficiency to LCs, we bred the IL-6<sup>f/f</sup> mice (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Sanchis et al., 2020</xref>) to the huLangerinCre mice (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). The resulting genotypes were determined using PCR, and the selective genomic recombination of the IL-6 locus in LCs was confirmed using PCR on sorted cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1 D</xref>). We then tested whether LC-derived IL-6 is needed to induce Tfh cells and antibody responses. The mice were transferred with transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> TE&#x003b1; cells and then injected with 1 &#x003bc;g of anti-huLangerin-E&#x003b1; intraperitoneally, as described above. Cre-negative IL-6<sup>f/f</sup> littermate mice served as controls. The mice were sacrificed 4 and 14 days later to characterize antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and B cell responses as presented above (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). The expansion and phenotype of TE&#x003b1; cells in the absence of LC-derived IL-6 remained unchanged (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). The B cell responses, including GC cells and anti-hIgG IgG serum levels, showed no significant changes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Thus, these data support the idea that LC-derived IL-6 is not required to support steady-state adaptive immune responses.</p><p id="P10">To rule out the possibility that IL-6 produced and secreted by bystander cells might aid the induction of adaptive immune responses by steady-state IL-6 deficient LCs, we performed IL-6 blocking experiments. Batf3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were treated with anti-IL-6 or isotype antibodies throughout the experiment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Luminex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> assay on serum samples was used to confirm the efficiency of IL-6 blockade (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1 E</xref>). The antibody-treated Batf3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that lack cDC1s were adoptively transferred with CD4<sup>+</sup> TE&#x003b1; cells and then injected with 1 &#x003bc;g of anti-muLangerin-E&#x003b1;, and then T and B cell responses were assessed as presented above. We found no significant differences in antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and B cell expansions and phenotype (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">D</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). The anti-huIgG IgG ELISA on serum samples revealed only a moderate decrease in antibody levels in the anti-IL-6 treated mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>). Thus, cumulatively, our experiments showed that neither LC-derived nor total IL-6 plays a critical role in the induction of adaptive immune responses by steady-state LCs.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>ICOS-ICOS-L signaling has no major role in the induction of adaptive immune responses by steady-state LCs</title><p id="P11">Since steady-state levels of IL-6 and type-I interferon had no significant role in inducing adaptive immune responses by LCs, we turned our attention to membrane-bound co-stimulation. ICOS-ICOS-L signaling, including on DCs, is required to induce Tfh cells and subsequent antibody responses in inflammatory settings (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Pratama et al., 2015</xref>).

For this <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> platform, we used the MutuDC1 DC cells line (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Fuertes Marraco et al., 2012</xref>), OT-II cells from a Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> background, and polyclonal primary B cells isolated from WT na&#x000ef;ve mice (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). The DCs and B cells were pulsed with OVA-peptide before co-culture, while cells not exposed to OVA served as controls. We anticipated that pulsing the polyclonal B cells with OVA-peptide should allow the cognate interaction with OT-II cells. Through this interaction, we expected that the B cells would provide the final maturation signals for the OT-II cells to differentiate into Tfh cells. In return, the T cells would facilitate the B cell responses, including isotype switching and antibody production. Indeed, we found that in the co-cultures where the DCs and the B cells were pulsed with OVA-peptide, the OT-II cells efficiently proliferated and differentiated into Tfh cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). We also observed that a significant proportion of B cells underwent isotype switching and acquired GC phenotype (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). We also detected substantial amounts of secreted IgG in the supernatant (data not shown). As expected, the inclusion of blocking MHC-II antibodies in the co-cultures prevented the T and B cell responses (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2 A</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>). Furthermore, the primary DCs and MutuDC2 DC cell line (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Pigni et al., 2018</xref>) in this co-culture assay also supported T and B cell responses but with different efficiencies (data not shown).

We supplemented the co-cultures with blocking antibodies targeting CD40L (CD154), CD80/CD86, and ICOS-L (CD275) to test. We observed that blocking CD80 and CD86, but not the others, significantly inhibited the differentiation of Tfh cells and class-switched (GL7<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup>) B cell responses (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">B</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2 A</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>).

Thus, membrane-bound co-stimulation through CD80/CD86 is critical for steady-state LC-induced adaptive immune responses.</p><p id="P14">In inflammatory settings, CD80/CD86 on DCs, but not on B cells, are required for adaptive T and B cell responses (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>). To define whether those findings also apply to our steady-state antigen targeting model, we first used our <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> co-culture assay presented above with slight modification. We co-cultured magnetically enriched migratory DCs from the SDLNs of WT or CD80/CD86 double knock-out (DKO) mice pulsed with anti-muLangerin-OVA or IgG4-OVA with OT-II T cells and WT or CD80/CD86 double knock-out B cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2 C</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">D</xref>). The Tfh cell differentiation was unaffected by the lack of CD80/CD86 on the B cells but was almost absent in cultures with DCs that lacked CD80/CD86 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>). These data, therefore, support the idea that CD80/CD86 expression by DCs plays a critical role in the induction of Tfh cell responses.</p><p id="P15">In an attempt to confirm these <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> findings <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, we generated bone marrow chimeras using the CD80/CD86 DKO, huLangerin, and Batf3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. We first irradiated CD80/CD86 DKO or huLangerin mice as previously described (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>). The irradiated DKO mice were reconstituted with Batf3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow, while irradiated huLangerin mice were with DKO bone marrow. In the irradiated DKO chimeras reconstituted with Batf3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow, the LCs remain host origin and, as such, lack CD80/CD86. In the irradiated huLangerin mice reconstituted with DKO bone marrow, the only cell expressing CD80/CD86 would be the LCs expressing human Langerin targetable with the anti-huLangerin-E&#x003b1; construct. We hypothesized that the resulting two chimeras would allow us to test whether LCs&#x02019; CD80/CD86 is required and sufficient for the induction of Tfh cells and antibody responses. However, our analyses of bone marrow chimeras before use for interrogating T and B cell responses revealed that the DKO LCs became CD80/CD86 positive (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2 E</xref>) when reconstituted with Batf3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow, suggesting that LCs overcome their functional deficiency by picking up CD80/CD86 from the surrounding cells through intracellular monitoring (ICM), a phenomenon recently identified by our laboratory (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Herbst et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, this prevented us from testing whether LC-restricted CD80/CD86 is required for adaptive immune responses. We also failed to test for sufficiency because irradiated huLangerin mice reconstituted with DKO bone marrow led to the elimination of the host huLangerin-expressing LCs (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2 F</xref>). Likely, CD80/CD86 reactive T cells from the DKO bone marrow mediated the rejection of host CD80/CD86 expressing LCs. Thus, because of these technical challenges, our <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> efforts to confirm the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> findings have failed and remain to be further explored upon the discovery of ICM-specific blocking/interfering agents.</p><p id="P16">In summary, we demonstrate that Langerhans cells (LCs) promote GC-Tfh and B cell responses in steady-state, independent of IL-6, type-I interferon, and ICOS signaling. However, we found that CD80/CD86 expression on DCs is essential for inducing these adaptive immune responses. These findings differentiate steady-state T cell differentiation from the conventional three-signal model of T cell differentiation in inflammatory settings, where cytokines are indispensable third signals.</p><p id="P17">The induction of humoral immune responses in the steady-state is not exclusive to LCs. Splenic cDC1s have also been reported to support Tfh and antibody responses, though their ability to do so, unlike LCs&#x02019;, depends on the receptor targeted (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Steiner et al., 2022</xref>). In previous experiments, targeting migratory skin cDC1s through Langerin and Dectin-1 failed to elicit GC-Tfh or B cell responses, instead promoting cells with a pre-Tfh/Th1 phenotype (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>). The reasons for these differences&#x02014;whether due to distinct cDC1 subsets residing in different tissues (e.g., lymph nodes vs. spleen) or specific receptor targeting&#x02014;remain to be elucidated. It will be crucial to investigate the instances when the cDC1s can support antibody responses, whether they undergo receptor-dependent alterations akin to those induced by inflammatory cues, such as IFN-&#x003b1; or poly-IC (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>). As previously observed, cDC1-induced pre-Tfh/Th1 responses via Langerin targeting in steady-state were also independent of type-I interferons and IL-6 (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2015</xref>), further reinforcing that adaptive immune response induced by DCs in steady-state are independent of cytokines. Notably, in our model, no polarizing adjuvants or pattern recognition ligands were used that could directly or indirectly differentially affect LCs and cDC1s. Both subsets were targeted via the same receptor, yet they induced distinct adaptive immune responses. This strongly supports the idea that DC subsets are functionally specialized or pre-programmed, even in steady-state, to drive specific adaptive immune responses. Our findings align with studies on pre-committed DC precursors in the bone marrow (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Satpathy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Schlitzer et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that tissue residency might play a limited role in shaping the functional specialization of DC subsets. These results underscore the intrinsic programming of DC subsets in directing distinct immune pathways.</p><p id="P18">The findings that these prominent immunological factors in defining Tfh cell differentiation and B cell responses in our model do not seem to be critical contributors do not rule out that other cytokines or soluble factors might play a significant role in the process. However, our observations may offer insight into the mechanisms underlying homeostatic immunity toward commensals (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Belkaid and Harrison, 2017</xref>) and the development of certain autoimmune diseases. Engagement of DCs by commensals through pattern recognition receptors, unlike pathogenic interactions, typically leads to no detectable or minimal activation and maturation (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Ansaldo et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting limited involvement of DC-derived cytokines in polarizing commensal-specific T helper (Th) subsets. If cytokines are not critical in steady-state, what drives distinct Th responses? One possibility is that DC subsets differ in their peptide-MHC levels, a hypothesis aligned with the quantitative model proposed by van Panhuys and colleagues (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Van Panhuys, 2016</xref>). However, our findings suggest that additional factors beyond peptide-MHC levels contribute to Tfh and B cell responses. LCs, across a wide range of antigen doses, while with different efficiency, uniquely support antibody responses (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>), unlike cDC1s, which fail to do so under similar conditions. LCs appear to provide stronger cumulative TCR stimulation, evidenced by sustained CD69 expression, pS6 phosphorylation (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>), and Nur77-GFP signals (unpublished observation) in T cells activated by LCs. Given that Tfh differentiation requires stronger TCR stimulation than Th1 differentiation (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Bhattacharyya and Feng, 2020</xref>), this enhanced signal may explain the unique ability of LCs to promote Tfh cells. How LCs provide more potent stimuli than cDC1s and drive distinct adaptive immune responses in steady-state and inflammation (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Igy&#x000e1;rt&#x000f3; et al., 2011</xref>) remains to be determined. While here we show that CD80/CD86 play an essential role in LC-induced adaptive immune responses, the contribution of CD80/CD86 as the second signal is likely not unique to LCs since other DCs in the lymph nodes also express high levels of CD80/CD86. Thus, other factors unique to these DC subsets, such as differentially expressed CD11a and CD11b integrins (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bouteau et al., 2019</xref>), molecules that play an essential role in regulating immunological synapses (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Balkow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Varga et al., 2007</xref>), could likely serve as the decisive &#x0201c;third signal&#x0201d; and polarize the na&#x000ef;ve T cells into distinct Th cells.</p><p id="P19">LCs and cDC1s exhibit distinct cytokine transcript profiles in the steady state, which may underlie their functional specialization (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Igy&#x000e1;rt&#x000f3; et al., 2011</xref>). LCs are enriched in transcripts for <italic toggle="yes">Il1b, Il6</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Il23p19</italic>, aligning with their capacity to promote Th17 responses. Conversely, cDC1s harbor higher levels of <italic toggle="yes">Il12p40</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Il27</italic> transcripts, correlating with their roles in driving Th1 and CTL responses. Interestingly, <italic toggle="yes">Il12p40</italic> transcript expression is detectable even in pre-committed bone marrow cDC1 precursors (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Schlitzer et al., 2015</xref>), indicating intrinsic programming that primes DCs for rapid and specific cytokine production upon activation. These findings suggest that DC subsets are poised to respond swiftly to external stimuli by producing subset-specific cytokines that facilitate targeted Th polarization. However, our steady-state results indicate that cytokines may not be involved in the polarization of Th cells under non-inflammatory conditions. Therefore, we propose a model wherein, in the steady-state differential expression of adhesion molecules&#x02014;such as integrins (CD11a and CD11b)&#x02014;by DC subsets may provide a critical &#x0201c;third signal&#x0201d; to skew adaptive immune responses. These integrin-mediated could selectively promote &#x0201c;basic&#x0201d; Tfh, Th1, and potentially Th2 differentiation without the need for cytokine-mediated signaling. Under inflammatory conditions, cytokines would act as a &#x0201c;fourth signal,&#x0201d; boosting and further polarizing the T helper cells into effector subsets, such us Th17, Th22, and others, tailored to combat the specific infection and restore tissue homeostasis. This dual-layered model highlights how DC subsets integrate their intrinsic programming with environmental cues to orchestrate adaptive immunity dynamically.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="S10"><title>Mice</title><p id="P20">huLangerin (also called huLangerin-DTR) (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bobr et al., 2010</xref>), Batf3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Edelson et al., 2010</xref>), and huLangerinCre (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 2007</xref>) mice have been previously described. huLangerinCre were crossed with IFN&#x003b1;R1<sup>f/f</sup> (Jackson Laboratories strain 028256) or IL-6<sup>f/f</sup> (mice provided by Dr. Roger Davis, University of Massachusetts; developed by Dr. Juan Hidalgo at Universitat Aut&#x000f2;noma de Barcelona) (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Sanchis et al., 2020</xref>).
