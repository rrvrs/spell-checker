</p></sec><sec id="sec4723"><title>Results</title><p>Almost 20%&#x000a0;of 18-25 years olds, due to be seen in Youth Community Service had been prescribed Risperidone. Of these, only 44% had had prolactin levels done, despite the guidance. This equates to the over half not having prolactin checked. 60% of patients reveiwed had symptoms of hyperprolactinemia. Indications for use included emotional dysregulation/EUPD, psychosis, ADHD, OCD/ASD and depression</p></sec><sec id="sec4724"><title>Conclusions</title><p>
Risperidone should be used with extreme caution in this patient group. Medication can be very useful for some young people experiencing distressing symptoms but, as Hippocrates advises, &#x0201c;do no harm&#x0201d;&#x000a0;and seek not to cause iatrogenic harm.</p><p>
Given that many of the young people seen by mental health services are experiencing emotional dysregulation (not necessarily an abnormal state in adolescent, when much is in flux), it is tempting to consider medication as one means of trying to alleviate distress. There is no clear treatment for dysregulated feelings, and most would accept that psychological support is more appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="sec4725"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
