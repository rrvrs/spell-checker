Consenting mothers were followed up to their homes. A self-structured, validated, interviewer-administered questionnaire with a reliability score of 0.87 was used for data collection. Appropriate umbilical cord care, breastfeeding, and thermoregulation practices of mothers were evaluated by rating their responses: 1 for YES and 0 for NO. SPSS version 25 was used for data analysis. Data were summarized in tables and charts. Associations between variables were tested using multivariable logistic regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par13">The majority (83.3%) of mothers practiced appropriate thermoregulation for their newborns, while only 23.8% and 41.3% practiced exclusive breastfeeding and proper cord care, respectively. The most common reasons given for the poor practice of essential newborn care (ENBC) were ignorance and the influence of family and friends. Predictors of good ENBC practices among the variables tested included place of delivery and educational status of mothers. Place of delivery significantly influenced umbilical cord care, with mothers who delivered in primary health centers showing the lowest odds of practicing proper cord care (AOR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.50; 95% CI: 0.28&#x02013;0.89; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.018). Similarly, educational status significantly influenced mothers' thermoregulation practices, with mothers who had only primary education exhibiting the least odd to practicing good thermoregulation (AOR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.30; 95% CI: 0.09&#x02013;0.97; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.044).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par14">The study noted sub-optimal ENBC among postnatal mothers specifically: umbilical cord care, practice of exclusive breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact.

The first 28 days of life are the most vulnerable and critical period for a child&#x02019;s survival, accounting for approximately 50&#x02013;70% of infant mortality globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization, 2.3 million children die within the first 28 days of life in 2022, with sub-Saharan Africa experiencing the highest neonatal mortality rate at 27 deaths per 1,000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nigeria, in particular, faces an even higher rate of 38 per 1,000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Most neonatal deaths linked to inadequate or poorly implemented newborn care practices, especially in the areas of umbilical cord care, thermal regulation, and breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Optimal umbilical cord care is essential for preventing infections and promoting proper healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In Nigeria, umbilical cord infections are responsible for 10&#x02013;19% of neonatal admissions and contribute to an estimated 30&#x02013;49% of neonatal deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Many studies have demonstrated that application of unclean substances to the cord stump creates a favorable environment for bacterial growth, increasing the risk of sepsis and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The World Health Organization recommends dry cord care and, where infection risk is high, the use of topical antiseptics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite these guidelines, the use of unorthodox substances such as hot compresses, cow dung, herbs, ash, and petroleum jelly persists in some communities, elevating the risk of tetanus and sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Similarly, breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition and immunological protection for infants, benefiting both children and mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, global exclusive breastfeeding rates remain suboptimal, reported at 44% in 2021, with even lower rates in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Many mothers do not maintain exclusive breastfeeding for the recommended 4&#x02013;6 months, often due to a lack of support or misinformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Understanding the determinants of breastfeeding practices is crucial for designing effective interventions to improve rates of early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding.</p><p id="Par19">Thermoregulation is another critical aspect of newborn care. Newborns are highly susceptible to hypothermia, which, although rarely a direct cause of death, contributes significantly to neonatal mortality as a comorbidity of severe infections, preterm birth, and asphyxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Inadequate thermal care practices, such as insufficient skin-to-skin contact or improper swaddling, can lead to hypothermia in newborns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Hypothermia contributes to a substantial proportion of neonatal mortality globally, mostly as a comorbidity of severe neonatal infections, preterm birth, and asphyxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">WHO guidelines emphasize immediate drying and wrapping of the newborn, as well as delayed bathing, to prevent hypothermia. All babies should be exclusively breastfed from birth until 6&#x000a0;months of age. Mothers should be counseled and provided support for EBF at each postnatal contact. Daily chlorhexidine (7.1% chlorhexidine digluconate aqueous solution or gel, delivering 4% chlorhexidine) application to the umbilical cord stump during the first week of life is recommended for newborns who are born at home in settings with high neonatal mortality (30 or more neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births). Clean, dry cord care is recommended for newborns born in health facilities and at home in low neonatal mortality settings. Use of chlorhexidine in these situations may be considered only to replace application of a harmful traditional substance, such as cow dung, to the cord stump. Bathing should be delayed until 24 h after birth. If this is not possible due to cultural reasons, bathing should be delayed for at least 6&#x000a0;h. Appropriate clothing for the baby for the ambient temperature is recommended. This means one to two more layers of than adults and the use of hats/caps. The mother and baby should not be separated and should stay in the same room 24 h a day. Communication and play with the newborn should be encouraged. Immunization should be promoted as per existing WHO guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Certain factors such as maternal age, maternal education, parity, access to healthcare services, family influence, and cultural beliefs have been linked to maternal health behaviors, including newborn care practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Nonetheless, gaps remain in understanding the full range of factors that shape mothers'home care of their newborn in Anambra State.</p><p id="Par22">Given the persistently high rates of neonatal morbidity and mortality in Nigeria, especially in the context of suboptimal home care practices, there is a pressing need for research focused on the determinants of maternal behaviors related to cord care, breastfeeding, and thermal regulation. This study aims to evaluate mothers'home practices related to umbilical cord care, breastfeeding, and thermal regulation for newborns in Anambra State, Nigeria, and to determine the association between selected sociodemographic variables of mothers (age, educational status, occupation, place of delivery, parity) and home care practices for newborns. These variables interact in complex ways to influence maternal health behaviors and care-seeking, underscoring the importance of comprehensive, multifaceted strategies that address these determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Gaining insight into the relationship between these factors and maternal adherence to essential newborn care (ENBC) practices is crucial for developing targeted interventions aimed at reducing neonatal mortality in Anambra State.</p><p id="Par23">The Quality Maternal and Newborn Care (QMNC) Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], complemented by a Holistic Framework for Maternal and Newborn Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], provides an evidence-based theoretical foundation for evaluating mothers&#x02019; home practices related to umbilical cord care, breastfeeding, and thermal regulation, as well as for examining the influence of socio-demographic factors in Anambra State, Nigeria. QMNC and holistic frameworks allow researchers to systematically evaluate mothers&#x02019; household practices against established standards, identify gaps between recommended and current practices, analyze how socio-demographic factors influence care behaviors, and make recommendations regarding the development of context-specific, culturally appropriate interventions to improve newborn health outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research design</title><p id="Par24">This study employed a cross-sectional survey design for the assessment of mothers&#x02019; home care of their neonates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study settings</title><p id="Par25">The study was conducted in Ihiala Local Government Area (LGA), Anambra State, South-East Nigeria.

Improper cord hygiene increases the odds of neonatal sepsis by 13 times compared to proper care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, Obaro et al. noted that poor cord care directly contributes to infections like omphalitis, which can progress to systemic sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A study by Dessalegn et al. reported that neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in low-resource settings, accounting for 30% of global neonatal deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Our findings align with the varying rates of proper umbilical cord care reported across Africa and Nigeria in particular. While Ndikom and colleagues documented 61.4% good practice in Ibadan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], Abhulimhen-Iyoha et al. found a much lower rate of 20.5% in Edo State [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Similarly, Kyololo and Kipkoech reported that only 27% of mothers in one Kenyan study used WHO-recommended chlorhexidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. A systematic review of African studies similarly revealed generally poor cord care practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The lower rates in Edo State may stem from methodological differences, as that study recruited mothers attending well-baby/immunization clinics with older infants, potentially introducing recall bias. Conversely, the higher rates in Ibadan could be attributed to their larger sample size and focus on mothers with infants specifically between two and eight weeks old.</p><p id="Par47">The first week postpartum is a critical window for establishing breastfeeding. Failure to support and promote exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) during this period undermines efforts to reduce child morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The finding that the majority of mothers (76.20%) demonstrated poor breastfeeding practices, with 72.60% not practicing exclusive breastfeeding during this critical first week postpartum, carries significant health, social, and economic implications (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, respectively). Delayed initiation or absence of breastfeeding in the first 24 h significantly increases infant mortality risk, as this raises the risk of neonatal diseases such as diarrhea, respiratory infections, otitis media, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), childhood obesity, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Suboptimal breastfeeding is associated with lower cognitive outcomes, with any breastfeeding up to six months linked to an approximate 3-point increase in IQ, which has long-term effects on educational attainment and adult earnings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. It is also noted that suboptimal breastfeeding is associated with reduced risks of myocardial infarction, hypertension, and stroke in mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. According to UNICEF, increased rates of these preventable childhood illnesses and maternal health issues place additional burdens on healthcare systems, leading to higher healthcare expenditures and resource use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">The most common barriers to exclusive breastfeeding identified by mothers were the belief that breast milk alone was insufficient for their infants, husband&#x02019;s refusal, inadequate time due to occupation, and advice from mothers-in-law or other women (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Identifying and addressing these barriers can help improve breastfeeding rates and outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Education, support, and community interventions are essential to promote positive breastfeeding attitudes and practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Effective interventions should include husbands in prenatal education, as many respondents reported their husbands&#x02019; refusal to support exclusive breastfeeding. Mothers should be provided with better support from family members, including husbands, mothers-in-law, and significant others. These results align with a study by Wasti et al., who reported a low prevalence rate of exclusive breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; however, they differ from the report of Malinga et al., who noted that about 93% of mothers in their study practiced exclusive breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">Most mothers (83.30%) demonstrated good thermoregulation practices, consistent with previous research findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, the low rate of skin-to-skin contact (24.90%), primarily due to lack of awareness, is concerning (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This aligns with Berhea et al. and Leta&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] reports of low thermoregulation knowledge (43.9%) and Kwesiga et al.'s findings of limited Kangaroo Mother Care practice in East-Central Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. These results highlight the need for targeted education on the benefits and proper implementation of skin-to-skin contact (SSC). SSC is a proven, evidence-based intervention that supports newborn survival, especially in regions with high neonatal mortality rates. Its absence can contribute to higher rates of preventable newborn deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Studies have shown that newborns who do not receive SSC are at higher risk of hospital admission within the first few hours or days of life, primarily due to issues like jaundice and feeding difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Similarly, SSC helps regulate the baby&#x02019;s heart rate, breathing, and temperature, supporting a smoother transition to life outside the womb. Without SSC, babies are more likely to experience physiological instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. SSC is closely linked to successful breastfeeding initiation, exclusive breastfeeding, and longer breastfeeding duration. Lack of SSC leads to lower breastfeeding rates and increased reliance on formula, which can negatively impact infant nutrition and immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Babies who miss out on SSC are more prone to feeding and sucking problems, which can further increase the risk of early hospital readmission and poor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The first hour after birth is critical for mother-infant bonding. SSC stimulates the release of oxytocin, fostering emotional connection and maternal behaviors. Lack of SSC can compromise this bonding process, potentially affecting maternal mental health and infant emotional development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">UNICEF indicated that SSC enables the transfer of beneficial bacteria from mother to baby, which is important for immune system development. Without it, infants may be more susceptible to infections. SSC has also been shown to lower stress (cortisol) levels in newborns, especially after painful procedures. Babies without SSC may experience higher stress, which can impact development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Since SSC is a low-cost, high-impact intervention, its underutilization represents a missed opportunity for improving newborn outcomes at scale, particularly in resource-limited settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This study, in line with others, consistently identifies lack of awareness as the leading barrier to SSC implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Addressing this gap requires targeted education for both healthcare workers and mothers, as well as clear guidelines and institutional support to make SSC a routine part of newborn care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">The study revealed delivery location as a significant predictor of umbilical cord care practices (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), with mothers who delivered in maternity homes associated with better practices than those who delivered in primary health care centers and private hospitals. Possible explanations for this finding include that maternity homes operated by trained midwives might provide more focused and specialized care, leading to better cord care practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Maternity homes might have more resources, such as guidelines, equipment, and supplies, that support better cord care practices. Maternity homes may prioritize client-centered care, leading to more personalized attention and education on cord care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Primary health care centers and private hospitals may have variable quality of care, resource limitations, or less coordinated care compared to maternity homes designed specifically for maternal waiting and delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Although not statistically significant, mothers who were older, had more children, or completed secondary education demonstrated better cord care practices. These trends likely reflect accumulated childcare experience, knowledge from previous births, and greater exposure to evidence-based information in hospital settings. Multiple studies have shown that higher maternal education is associated with better health-seeking behaviors and improved maternal and child health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In contrast, younger mothers and those with lower education levels are more likely to rely on cultural practices and advice from family and friends. Consistent with this finding, Dessalegn et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] Asiegbu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and Abhulimhen-Iyoha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] found that higher education and greater parity predicted appropriate umbilical cord care. More so, the place of delivery significantly influenced cord care practices, emphasizing the critical role of the immediate postpartum environment and the quality of information provided during this period. Similar findings were reported by Abhulimhen-Iyoha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and Malinga et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] However, Abebe et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] observed a different trend. In their study, most women (65.5%) were housewives; a greater number (53%) attended monthly pregnant women&#x02019;s meetings, and 77.6% had antenatal care follow-ups. Therefore, their study participants had numerous channels through which they accessed beneficial information. Additionally, maternal occupation did not significantly influence cord care practices in this study, similar to what Abebe et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] reported. This observation may be due to the influence of confounders like educational levels, ANC attendance and access to multiple health promotion information. However, Abhulimhen-Iyoha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and Malinga et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] found that place of delivery and occupation type were strong determinants of good umbilical cord care.</p><p id="Par53">Furthermore, results show that mothers who are traders and civil servants have higher odds to exclusive breastfeeding practices although not statistically significant (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Possible explanations for higher odds of exclusive breastfeeding among traders and civil servants compared to farmers could be linked to the fact that traders and civil servants often have more flexible work schedules or structured work environments than farmers, allowing them to take breaks or adjust their routines for breastfeeding or expressing milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Civil service jobs may provide maternity leave, designated breaks, or even breastfeeding rooms, which facilitate exclusive breastfeeding. In contrast, farming typically involves long hours in the field, far from home and without private or hygienic spaces for breastfeeding or expressing milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Traders, who may be self-employed or work in markets close to home, can sometimes bring their infants with them, making breastfeeding more feasible compared to farmers working in remote or dispersed locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. They may also have greater access to health information and services, further supporting exclusive breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Farming is physically demanding and often requires mothers to be away from their infants for extended periods, making exclusive breastfeeding logistically challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In contrast, the less physically demanding and more predictable environments of civil service and trading can make it easier to maintain exclusive breastfeeding routines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">It was also observed that higher maternal age and increased parity were associated with improved breastfeeding practices, though not reaching statistical significance. This finding could be attributed to experience garnered with age, having had multiple childbirths, in addition to economic empowerment with an attendant capacity to make better choices. Other studies similarly found that higher parity, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] better access to essential newborn care information, and consistent antenatal care follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], all significantly improved the likelihood of proper breastfeeding practices. However, place of delivery and maternal educational status were not significant predictors of good breastfeeding practices in this study; similar to what has been reported by some researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Several factors may explain why mothers with primary, secondary, or tertiary education have lower odds of practicing good thermoregulation for their newborns compared to mothers with no formal education (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). More educated mothers may be influenced by modern health beliefs or practices that do not emphasize traditional thermoregulation methods, such as immediate skin-to-skin contact or wrapping the baby warmly. They may perceive these practices as outdated or less necessary, especially if exposed to conflicting information from various sources. A study has found that higher education can sometimes correlate with earlier adoption of formula feeding or early bathing routines, which may disrupt optimal thermoregulation practices. Educated mothers may be more likely to follow hospital routines or advice that do not prioritize traditional thermal care, especially in settings where health worker training is inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Educated mothers, particularly those who are employed, may return to work sooner or have busier lifestyles, leading to less opportunity for practices like prolonged skin-to-skin contact or exclusive rooming-in, both of which support good thermoregulation.</p><p id="Par56">Mothers with higher education may have greater trust in incubators, heaters, or hospital technology for thermal care, assuming that these replace the need for hands-on thermoregulation practices. Exposure to a wider range of health information, including from the internet and social media, can lead to confusion or selective adoption of practices, sometimes at the expense of basic but effective newborn care routines. In summary, while education is generally associated with better health practices, in some contexts it may lead to lower adherence to traditional or recommended thermoregulation methods due to shifts in beliefs, lifestyle constraints, or trust in alternative approaches. This paradox highlights the importance of context-specific health education and reinforces the value of essential newborn care practices across all education levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">Additionally, occupation type, access to thermoregulation information and delivery in primary health centers all predicted improved practices. These findings align with previous research identifying educational status, maternal occupation and access to essential newborn care information as factors increasing the odds of good thermoregulation practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. However, one contrasting study found no association between maternal education and thermoregulation practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], likely due to confounding factors such as high rates of antenatal care attendance (77.6%), institutional deliveries (59.9%) and participation in monthly pregnant mothers'meetings (53%)- all providing alternative channels for disseminating beneficial information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par58">This study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing newborn care practices in Anambra State, Nigeria and underscores the need for tailored interventions that promote existing beneficial practices and correct misconceptions surrounding newborn care across diverse populations.
