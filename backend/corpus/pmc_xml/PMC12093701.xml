Timely identification by screening can decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with CRC. This study aimed to evaluate the level of knowledge and perceived barriers related to CRC screening among university students.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A cross-sectional study was carried out among university students between October 2022 and July 2023. Data were gathered using an online survey that evaluated knowledge of CRC, with a specific emphasis on sociodemographic information, risk factors for CRC, warning signs and symptoms, and the available screening methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Out of the 2090 students, 74.8% were female, 54.3% were enrolled in the Faculty of Human Medicine, and 20.4% had a family history of CRC. The general knowledge of CRC and its risk factors was inadequate, as indicated by mean scores of 15.95&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.5 and 3.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.95, respectively. A total of 5.3% of the participants had received CRC screening, with colonoscopy being the most frequently employed screening method. In their perspective, the primary obstacles to CRC screening were the absence of endorsement from healthcare professionals, feelings of embarrassment, and apprehension over the outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">The study highlights the need for targeted educational campaigns and interventions to improve CRC awareness among university students and address identified obstacles toward screening. However, findings are limited by self-reported data, which may introduce recall bias and affect generalizability.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12889-025-22510-z.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>Screening</kwd><kwd>Knowledge</kwd><kwd>University students</kwd><kwd>Medical faculty</kwd><kwd>Barriers</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Colorectal cancer (CRC) refers to cancers that develop in the colon, recto-sigmoid junction, and rectum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. CRC is a major public health issue worldwide, characterized by high rates of incidence, prevalence, and fatality. By 2030, the incidence of new cases is expected to rise by 60%, resulting in more than 2.2&#x000a0;million additional cases and 1.1&#x000a0;million premature deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The American Cancer Society (2021) reports that the lifetime risk of acquiring CRC in the United States is around 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In Egypt, CRC is a frequent malignancy, accounting for 3.4% of male malignancies and 3% of female malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For the year 2020, CRC ranked as the ninth most prevalent cancer in Egypt, with around 4942 newly diagnosed cases and 2717 fatalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These elevated rates may be attributed to the increasing age of the population, evolving lifestyle and nutritional patterns, insufficient public knowledge, and restricted availability of screening and treatment services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. CRC is a complex systemic illness affected by several risk factors, such as age, genetics, lifestyle, and environmental conditions. Nevertheless, age is a highly influential determinant for CRC, with a rising occurrence of CRC in younger persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Notably, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, and Iran had CRC incidence rates in young adults under the age of 40 of 38%, 21%, 17%, and 15&#x02013;35%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Minimizing the morbidity and mortality linked to CRC requires the implementation of preventive measures and early identification. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified 40% of malignancies as preventable and 40% as curable if identified at an early stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The most effective screening methods for CRC are yearly fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), adaptive sigmoidoscopy every decade with an annual FIT test, or a colonoscopy every decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, Egypt has limited resources for CRC diagnosis and does not have any ongoing screening initiatives at the national level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Consequently, CRC is detected at later stages among younger Egyptians, resulting in a median overall survival of about two years for CRC patients in Egypt. Therefore, it is essential to promote knowledge of risk factors, screening methods, and the significance of prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Noteworthy, significant transformations have affected education and societal perceptions of universities. Modern universities are now viewed as active contributors to community development, prompting them to embrace their role in addressing current challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Colleges foster social responsibility that involves advancing society through education, research, and technology adaptation by integrating community service into their mandates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. From a student&#x02019;s perspective, community service is either a mandatory obligation or a response to others&#x02019; needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Despite that university students participate in volunteer work that allows them to gain knowledge, they often have lower awareness of CRC screening and prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It was demonstrated that there was a lack of awareness of CRC screening among university students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance understanding and consciousness of CRC screening through educational programming, especially if initiated at the academic degree level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, only a limited number of research have investigated the knowledge, practice, and perceived barriers to CRC, with no previous studies focused on university students in Egypt. Addressing these gaps is essential to inform future educational interventions and public health strategies at the national level. University students, in particular, represent a key demographic for targeted health education programs due to their potential to act as future advocates for health promotion. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the level of knowledge, practice, and perceived barriers related to CRC screening among university students in Egypt.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Study design &#x00026; population</title><p id="Par8">an analytical Cross-sectional study was conducted on all Egyptian university students who accepted to participate and enrolled in the academic year (2022&#x02013;2023).

Students were given a concise explication of the research and its primary objectives. The questionnaire was initially created in English to enhance the response rate and subsequently translated into Arabic. To ensure translation accuracy, we conducted a Forward-backward Arabic translation of the questionnaire by a bilingual expert. The back-translated version was then compared with the original English one for accuracy. The tools were presented to three professor experts from distinct fields (Public Health &#x00026; Community Medicine and General Surgery) to evaluate the questionnaire&#x02019;s validity. Their purpose was to determine the extent to which the questionnaire aligns with the study&#x02019;s objectives and the intended cohort. To ensure reliability, the questionnaire&#x02019;s internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach&#x02019;s Alpha (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.868).</p><p>Through the assistance of academic connections and research assistants at all the faculties under study, the final questionnaire was posted and disseminated online between October 7th, 2022, and February 23rd, 2023. As a precaution against redundant responses, the survey was restricted to a single response on Google Forms. To encourage participation and maximize the response rate, reminders were sent periodically, and students were motivated to share the questionnaire with their peers. The response rate was more than 95%.</p><p>The questionnaire comprised four domains. The first domain focused on sociodemographic data, including age, sex, faculty, and academic year. The second domain assessed participants&#x02019; knowledge about CRC, including its preventive measures and risk factors. The third domain evaluated knowledge about warning signs and symptoms of CRC. Finally, the fourth domain explored awareness of the available screening methods for CRC.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Scoring system</title><p id="Par12">The knowledge section results were evaluated using Bloom&#x02019;s cut-off point, with a score of 80 to 100% designated as good, 60 to 79% as moderate, and less than 60% as poor.

Only 5.3% of the participants had undergone previous screening for CRC without a statistically significant difference between medical (4.7%) and non-medical college students (6.1%). Colonoscopy (76.5%) was the most used modality of CRC screening followed by CT colonography (23.5%). The most reported barrier for CRC screening was no available recommendation from the health care providers (45.1%) without a statistically significant difference between medical and non-medical college students. Feeling embarrassed (38.3%) was the second most reported barrier, with significantly higher proportions among medical college students (43.7%) as compared with non-medical college students (31.8%), (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). Also, fear of results was a significant barrier, with 35.9% of students reporting this as a reason for not having CRC screening. On the other hand, fear of results was recorded more frequently among nonmedical students than medical students, with a statistically significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001). Financial burden and cost were reported as a barrier by 20.4% of participants, while fear of painful procedures was reported by 21.1%. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of perceived barriers toward them.</p><p id="Par25">

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par31">CRC is a significant public health concern with high impact, particularly when detected at later stages, making it crucial to understand the knowledge, practices, and barriers related to CRC screening among university students for effective early detection and prevention efforts. The results showed a great lack of knowledge about CRC, particularly its risk factors, especially among non-medical college students. Moreover, only a small proportion of students had undergone CRC screening (5.3%). The most reported barriers to CRC screening were the lack of recommendations from healthcare providers, feeling embarrassed, and fear of results. The current results suggest that medical education plays an important role in increasing the knowledge of CRC among students. Still, it is not sufficient to achieve a high level of knowledge.</p><p id="Par32">Approximately half of the medical college students (51%) and three-quarters of the non-medical college students (71%) had poor overall knowledge about CRC. Specifically, the students had the poorest knowledge regarding the risk factors associated with CRC, followed by the disease&#x02019;s warning signs, screening methods, and preventive factors. Only 6% of medical students had good knowledge of CRC risk factors, 60% knew preventive factors, 26% were aware of CRC, and 2% understood screening methods. Among non-medical students, 2% had good knowledge of risk factors, while 12% knew preventive factors and warning signs. When examining overall and specific knowledge domains, medical students significantly outperformed non-medical students in terms of their knowledge about different aspects of CRC. This indicates that medical college students generally possess a better understanding of CRC, which could be attributed to their specialized curriculum, clinical exposure, access to resources, peer learning, and mentoring from experienced healthcare professionals. These findings are consistent with other studies among adults in different countries, where more than half of their studied students had poor knowledge regarding CRC risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This indicates that the gaps in CRC knowledge observed among the participant students are not unique to this cohort but reflect a broader phenomenon. In the context of university students, similar to our finding, Aga et al. reported better awareness of medical students in Saudi Arabia regarding different aspects of CRC than non-medical students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, another study among Saudi Arabian medical students has shown that more than half of them had inadequate knowledge about CRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. On the other hands, another study in Jordon showed that university students exhibited good knowledge and awareness regarding CRC and its risk factors. In a study conducted in Pakistan by Hussain et al., it was revealed that the overall knowledge regarding CRC, encompassing its risk factors and symptoms, among participants stood at 44.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. While a majority of respondents demonstrated familiarity with CRC itself (66.6%) and its associated risk factors (50.9%), knowledge concerning warning signs was notably lacking, with only 40% awareness. This discrepancy could reflect cultural and regional differences and variations in the assessment tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Understanding and analyzing the predictors of CRC knowledge and screening practice are critical steps for communities that are trying to increase screening among priority populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Regarding knowledge predictors, the results show that students who had medical education and those who had previously heard about CRC had significantly higher odds of having high knowledge scores. Along the same line, different studies have explored the factors associated with CRC knowledge and found that factors such as education, prior awareness of CRC, and exposure to medical education or healthcare information are associated with higher knowledge scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In Saudi Arabia, Imran et al. highlighted that medical students displayed higher knowledge regarding CRC compared to non-medical students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Several CRC screening modalities aimed at early detection have been developed, and there is a substantial body of evidence supporting the benefits of CRC screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Paradoxically, participation rates in screening programs were low worldwide, at an estimated 65% in the United States (US), and ranging from 1.9 to 54% across Europe had undergone previous CRC screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Among university students, Hussain et al., reported that 24.4% of participants had been involved in CRC screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the present study, 5.3% reported that they had undergone screening for CRC. When considering university students, it is expected that the number of students who have undergone screening would be minimal. Generally, CRC screening isn&#x02019;t recommended for this specific population to undergo routine CRC screening. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the vast majority of these students would not meet the criteria for screening based on their age alone.</p><p id="Par34">Family history can have a strong impact on screening behavior. Students who had relatives with gastrointestinal (GIT) tumors were more likely to have done CRC screening than those who did not. This may reflect their higher awareness of their risk and their proactive attitude towards their health. Previous literature supports this finding, as it has reported that individuals with affected relatives are often advised to start screening at a younger age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">This study reported that female participants were less likely to undergo CRC screening than males. This is consistent with the previous research by Lisa et al. (2011), who found women in the US and Canada had lower rates of CRC screening than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This disparity in screening rates for CRC compared to breast and cervical cancers may be attributed, in part, to the misperception among women and their physicians that CRC is primarily a &#x0201c;man&#x02019;s disease.&#x0201d; However, it is worth noting that other studies have shown that women tend to have higher rates of preventive health behaviors, including CRC screenings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This suggests that the observed pattern may be influenced by cultural or contextual factors that require further exploration in future research. Understanding these factors can provide valuable insights into the barriers and facilitators specific to female populations and help develop targeted interventions to address the disparities in CRC screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Understanding the barriers to CRC screening is crucial for developing effective screening programs aiming at increasing participation. Among the participants who had not undergone CRC screening, the most reported barrier was a lack of recommendations from health care providers. These findings are in accordance with the results of other studies where a lack of recommendations and a lack of a reminder system were reported as significant barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Moreover, the results of other studies supported the positive and direct relationship between healthcare provider recommendation and intention to undergo screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Therefore, healthcare workers must communicate the benefits of CRC screening to their patients and encourage them to do it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Interestingly, in this study, feeling embarrassed was reported as a barrier to CRC screening significantly more often among medical college students compared to non-medical college students. This finding may be attributed to the higher level of knowledge about CRC screening practices and techniques among medical college students. The former students are more aware of potential discomfort or embarrassment associated with CRC screening procedures. In Egypt, the lack of easily accessible knowledge resources and awareness campaigns for the general population contributes to the existing barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similarly, Althobati et al. underscore that embarrassment and fear of diagnosis are prevalent barriers among medical students in Saudi Arabia, highlighting a broader issue that affects screening rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The lack of awareness about CRC and its screening methods, coupled with a shortage of trained healthcare providers, points to systemic issues that resonate with the barriers reported by medical students. On the other hand, fear of results was more frequently reported as a barrier among non-medical students than medical students. This discrepancy could be attributed to a lower proportion of non-medical college students who believe in the usefulness of screening tests compared to medical college students. In alignment with this observation, Hussain et al. pinpointed fear of a possible CRC diagnosis through screening, anxiety associated with screening procedures, and inadequate comprehension of CRC screening as predominant barriers to engaging in CRC screening practices among non-medical students in Pakistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It is noteworthy to mention that cultural perceptions in Egypt significantly shape the barriers to CRC screening, manifesting in feelings of embarrassment and fear regarding potential results. Bateman et al., in their study on Egyptian primary care physicians and specialists, highlighted how socioeconomic status and a lack of interest in preventive measures, influenced by the Egyptian cultural context, deter individuals from seeking screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The fear of receiving a cancer diagnosis, often perceived as a death sentence, further exacerbates this reluctance. Similar barriers have been identified in studies across the Middle East and North Africa region, indicating a broader cultural pattern that prioritizes treatment over prevention. Research on breast cancer screening in these areas reveals comparable issues, such as cultural stigma and fear, which hinder proactive health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Strength &#x00026; limitations</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Strengths</title><p id="Par38">The strength of this study is its large sample size. Using a web-based questionnaire allowed for efficient data collection, reaching a wide range of participants. The study&#x02019;s focus on university students is particularly relevant as they are a key target group for health education interventions. Additionally, the study assessed not only knowledge but also screening practices and perceived barriers, providing an overview of the factors influencing CRC screening behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par39">However, there are certain limitations to consider. Firstly, the study utilized a cross-sectional design, which limits the ability to establish causality or temporal relationships between variables. Secondly, data were collected using self-reported measures, which are subject to recall bias and social desirability bias. To mitigate recall bias in future research, mixed-methods approaches such as qualitative interviews or focus group discussions could be employed to validate self-reported data and provide deeper insights into students&#x02019; knowledge and perceptions of CRC. Additionally, longitudinal studies could help track changes in awareness and screening behaviors over time. Additionally, the study relied on voluntary participation. Hence, students who have a higher interest in health-related topics or those who had personal experiences with CRC may have been more likely to participate, leading to an overrepresentation of individuals with higher knowledge levels. To address self-selection bias, future research could implement random sampling techniques or actively recruit students from diverse academic disciplines and backgrounds to enhance representation. Moreover, unmeasured confounders such as socio-economic status, access to healthcare, or prior exposure to health campaigns were not assessed and could have influenced the study outcomes. Finally, the findings may not be generalizable to other populations outside of Egyptian university students or to those not engaged in academic settings, as the sample may not reflect the diversity of the broader population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par40">In conclusion, this study underscores the concerning lack of knowledge and practice of CRC screening among university students, with notable disparities between medical and non-medical faculty students. The findings emphasize the need for focused educational interventions and awareness programs to bridge the knowledge gap, especially among non-medical university students, and promote early detection and prevention of CRC. Specific initiatives could include integrating CRC education into the university curriculum, utilizing interactive teaching methods, organizing student-centered screening campaigns, using peer-led educational initiatives, and leveraging social media campaigns to improve knowledge with a special focus on non-medical students. Collaborations with healthcare providers to deliver workshops and seminars can further enhance students&#x02019; understanding and engagement with CRC screening. Additionally, addressing barriers such as the absence of healthcare provider recommendations, feelings of embarrassment, and fear of results is crucial for improving screening rates. Ultimately, by addressing these issues, we can work towards reducing the burden of CRC and promoting a healthier future for all.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
