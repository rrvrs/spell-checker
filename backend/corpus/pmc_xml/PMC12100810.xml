Recent studies have identified life participation as a top priority for adults with CKD. This scoping review aims to comprehensively identify studies of interventions that targeted life participation outcomes in adults with predialysis CKD, and identify gaps in the literature.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This scoping review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology. Five electronic databases were searched with additional sources identified through backwards chaining. Title and abstract screening were conducted independently by four screeners after initial inter-rater calibration, and full text screening and data extraction were undertaken by two researchers in duplicate. Data analysis was completed using descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">This scoping review identified twenty-three studies that examined interventions to support life participation in the CKD population. No studies targeted life participation as a primary outcome. When categorizing studies via the Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement (CMOP-E) the majority (87%) of interventions targeted personal-physical mechanisms of disability, with a predominant focus on pharmacological (48%) or exercise (35%) interventions. Dedicated outcome measures for life participation were rarely used, with the role-physical, role-emotional and social functioning subscales of the SF-36 quality of life assessment being the most common life participation outcome measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This scoping review highlights a lack of research and prioritization of life participation in CKD. It demonstrates the narrow scope of intervention approaches used to support life participation, and limitations in how studies assess life participation. These gaps indicate a need for further research to support this top priority health outcome for the CKD community.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical trial number</title><p id="Par5">As this is a scoping review, no clinical trial number is provided.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12882-025-04162-8.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Life participation</kwd><kwd>Chronic kidney disease</kwd><kwd>Occupational engagement</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Disability</kwd><kwd>Occupational therapy</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par6">Approximately 10% of the global population experience chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. People with CKD can experience many life changing health complications, which can affect their ability to engage in meaningful life activities such as self care, leisure, and productive activities. CKD has a high burden of disability and is listed among the top 20 leading causes of disability-adjusted life years globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Research has shown that the presence of CKD is associated with a significant decline in independence while performing instrumental activities of daily living, such as shopping and managing money, and basic activities of daily living, such as toileting, and eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Studies also show that individuals with CKD experience decreases in social contact, social participation, and community mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Life participation, defined as participating in one or more meaningful activity of life, has been shown to be a top priority for adults with chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Engagement in valued activities brings meaning to life, and it has been said that &#x0201c;sick minds, sick bodies and sick souls may be healed through occupation&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>](p.14). It has also been found that engaging in meaningful activities can be an essential aspect of improving the health of individuals with ongoing health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. With such an impact on health and quality of life, it is imperative to identify interventions that can improve the ability to engage in life activities in the CKD population.</p><p id="Par7">There are a number of health challenges associated with CKD that might contribute to its impact on engagement in meaningful activity. CKD has been found to be &#x0201c; an independent contributor to decline in physical and cognitive functions in older adults&#x02019;&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Some of the physical limitations individuals with CKD can experience include muscle wasting, weakness, low levels of physical activity, and frailty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The cognitive domains most affected by CKD are orientation, attention and language [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, there are also effects on the mental health of individuals with CKD with many experiencing depression (20&#x02013;25%), anxiety (19%), anxiety symptoms (49%) and psychological distress (26%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. All of these sequalae of CKD have the potential to profoundly impact engagement in meaningful activities.</p><p id="Par8">The need for quality research on interventions to enable life participation in the CKD population has previously been raised in the literature. For example, a 2022 article investigating lifestyle interventions for &#x0201c;enabling people to live well&#x0201d; with CKD highlighted a lack of quality research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The author discusses the most recent international guideline for &#x0201c;the evaluation of chronic kidney disease&#x0201d; and highlighted that although supportive interventions such as receiving expert dietary advice and psychological care are recommended for people with CKD, there is limited evidence to support the claims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The author also highlights how robust intervention recommendations exist for other chronic conditions such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis, but are lacking in chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Exercise is among the more common rehabilitative interventions studied in the CKD population, however few exercise programs have focused on enabling life participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Similarly, self-management interventions are relatively common interventions studied among the CKD population, but few have been found to target life participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">We therefore conducted a scoping review to systematically examine and characterize interventions that have been researched to address occupational engagement in adults with chronic kidney disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par10">This scoping review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As per the JBI decision tree for selecting scoping review methodology, the purpose of the review was to identify the types of available evidence, and to identify and analyze knowledge gaps. Our scoping review manuscript was written according to the PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines for scoping reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Search strategy</title><p id="Par11">As per JBI scoping review guidelines, this scoping review aimed to identify published literature and grey literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Electronic database searches were conducted using a comprehensive set of search terms representative of the target population (CKD) and concept (life participation). The databases searched include MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials and CINAHL Plus. A search for grey literature in the form of published abstracts was also conducted via Google Canada and Scopus. The most recent search was completed on December 20, 2023. Additional information sources were identified through backwards chaining using reference list scanning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study/source of evidence selection</title><p id="Par12">This scoping review followed a two-level screening process involving at least two reviewers, as outlined by the JBI method for scoping reviews. Duplicates were removed using the Covidence review management software. Screening questions were developed and used to determine source inclusion eligibility. Identified sources first went through level 1 screening, where titles and abstracts were screened based on the screening questions. Four screeners completed level 2 screening independently after undergoing a piloting and calibration exercise to ensure adequate inter-rater reliability (Kappa&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.8). Level 2 screening involved full text review of identified sources by two independent screeners in duplicate. Reasons for exclusion of sources during level 2 screening were recorded for transparency. Any disagreements between reviewers were resolved through discussion and if consensus was not attainable, a third member of the research team assisted with reaching consensus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p id="Par13">Any qualitative, quantitative study or mixed-methods study of an intervention used with the pre-dialysis CKD population that reported its impact on life participation was eligible for inclusion, as per the following criteria:</p><p id="Par14">

The most common life participation outcome measure used was the SF-36 (<italic>n&#x02009;=&#x02009;17</italic>; 73.9%), which assessed life participation via its role physical, role emotional, and social function subscales. Other outcome measures of life participation included the KDQOL&#x02013;work status, social interaction, social support, daily activities, and ADL/IADL subscales &#x02013; (<italic>n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6;</italic> 26%), EQ-5D &#x02013; self-care and usual activity subscales &#x02013; (<italic>n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2;</italic> 8.7%), qualitative interviews (<italic>n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2;</italic> 8.7%), Sickness Impact Profile (<italic>n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1;</italic> 4.4%), Human Activity Profile (<italic>n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1;</italic> 4.4%), Activities of Daily Living Scale (<italic>n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1;</italic> 4.4%), Duke Activity Status Index (<italic>n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1;</italic> 4.4%), Katz Index of ADLs (<italic>n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1;</italic> 4.4%), and The Self-management Questionnaire (<italic>n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1;</italic> 4.4%).

We found three key findings. First, our review underscores the lack of prioritization to investigate interventions that can promote life participation in people with CKDs. Second, we found that there has been an extremely limited breadth of intervention designs and mechanistic targets used to address life participation in CKD compared to the range of functional challenges people with CKD can face. Finally, measurement tools used in the current literature poorly capture life participation in people with CKD. Our review highlights the need for further research in this top-priority area of people with CKD to ensure they are receiving holistic and patient-focused care.</p><p id="Par28">Previous research has shown that CKD is associated with declining participation in meaningful activity, and that maintaining life participation is a top priority for adults with CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this review, we found only 23 intervention studies that assessed life participation as an outcome in this population, and no studies that examined life participation as a primary outcome. The absence of studies investigating life participation as a primary outcome demonstrate a clear lack of prioritization of this topic among nephrology researchers. This finding is consistent with what has been reported in previous explorations of similar topics; for example, a 2021 review found that lifestyle-related content was the least represented domain in self-management interventions for people with CKD, only being addressed in 11% of self-management programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The same study found that patients had only been involved in the design of one self-management program, which might help to explain the discrepancy between patient-priority research outcomes and what are actually being studied by nephrology researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Predialysis CKD patients should have a greater say in the direction and design of future studies moving forward, so that they better align with the priorities of the population whom they are aiming to help.</p><p id="Par29">Our review found that most studies (87%) used interventions that exclusively addressed the Personal&#x02013;Physical domain of the CMOP-E, which includes interventions targeting movement, strength, coordination, balance, endurance, pain, appearance, and physical illness and/or injury of body systems and/or structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In particular, the most common intervention approaches studied in this review were pharmacological (47.8%) and exercise (34.8%), both physically-focused approaches. While this finding is partially explained by the fact that life participation was not the primary outcome targeted in any study, it still strongly suggests that current research relating to life participation is deeply entrenched in the medical model of care, and is overly focused on one aspect of the disability experienced by the population. This narrow focus is contrasted against evidence showing that CKD leads to cognitive changes, particularly orientation &#x00026; attention and language [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]., which can interfere with life participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], Similarly, research has shown an impact on the psychosocial well-being of individuals with CKD, with studies finding increased rates of depression, psychological distress, and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. There is therefore a need to further investigate approaches in the CKD population, such as cognitive rehabilitation and psychotherapeutic programs, that are often used in other chronic disease groups to target nonphysical mechanisms of disability. Our review also found no studies attempting to promote life participation by targeting environmental factors, such as caregiver support, home modifications, or the use of assistive devices. Collectively, our findings show that existing research does not address the multiple, complex challenges of this patient population and their caregivers, and their need for holistic interventions that address multifaceted barriers to engaging in valued life activities.</p><p id="Par30">Most of the outcome measures (90.6%) used in the studies only assessed life participation incidentally as part of a broader measure of a related or umbrella concept. For example, the most common outcome measure (73.9%), the SF-36, is a health-related quality of life measure that includes three subscales which capture life participation. As such, while most outcome measures (60.86%) in this review appeared to examine life participation comprehensively with questions addressing all three domains of self-care, work, and leisure, most did so only superficially, with one or two questions addressing each domain. We underscore limitations of using quality of life measures to assess life participation that have been acknowledged in previous reviews, such as their lack of validation in CKD populations or lack of validation as primary life participation measures. In addition, the SF-36 subscales that assess life participation have not each been investigated to establish their responsiveness to change, making their use as intervention outcome measures particularly problematic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Collectively, our results indicate that studies have either not accurately captured the concept of life participation, or encapsulated enough content about life participation, to reflect the concept fully. This limitation highlights another important gap in the research literature on this topic.</p><p id="Par31">The strengths of our study include the use of multiple electronic databases in our search strategy to ensure comprehensiveness. Full text review and data extraction were completed in duplicate by two independent reviewers, which is considered the gold standard for scoping reviews and presents another strength for this review. Due to the language constraints of the reviewers, this review only examined papers written in English which we acknowledge as a limitation of the study. Future research should set out to explore articles written about life participation in different languages to increase our understanding of this important topic. Moreover, life participation and occupational engagement are not well-defined terms in the literature. While our review included a broad set of terms to attempt to capture the range of published works on this topic, it is possible that other terms were used which may not have been captured in our search. It is also possible that a broader set of interventions would have been captured by including impairment/body system outcomes (e.g. gait speed, strength cognitive functioning) as eligible for the review, since these outcomes might be favoured by researchers for being more likely to demonstrate an intervention effect. However, these outcomes should not be considered proxies for life participation, since life participation is determined not only by a person&#x02019;s capabilities but also by the resources, supports and skills they have to compensate for their limitations. As such, they were excluded from this review.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par32">In conclusion, this scoping review looked at papers that examined life participation in adults with CKD. The paper highlighted a lack of research and prioritization in this area, with current research using a narrow set of intervention approaches to support life participation, and few validated measures of life participation. These gaps indicate a need for further research to support this top priority health outcome for the CKD community.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
