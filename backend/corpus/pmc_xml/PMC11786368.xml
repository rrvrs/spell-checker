Inconsistent application of this approach may lead to variations in patient care quality and outcomes. Identifying the factors influencing adherence can help improve training to ensure more effective application across emergency settings. This study explores the theoretical knowledge of the ABCDE approach among Egyptian resident doctors and medical interns.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">An online survey was conducted in Egypt targeting resident doctors and medical interns. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 26 and Excel, descriptive statistics and association tests were used to measure the relationship between knowledge and demographic factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The study included 422 medical residents and interns, with most in university hospitals. The average knowledge score of 59.1% exposed specific gaps in understanding, emphasizing deficiencies in 12 questions answered by less than 50%. Notably, 49.5% acquired ABCDE knowledge from medical school, while 28.2% had ALS/BLS courses. Encouragingly, 91.2% expressed willingness for life support training. Statistical analyses unveiled significant associations between knowledge scores and both medical practice settings and sources of ABCDE knowledge. Surgeons exhibited the lowest knowledge scores among participants, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions across specialties.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">This study addresses a critical gap in ABCDE approach knowledge among Egyptian resident doctors and medical interns. The study points to the need for focused education, especially for surgeons, to improve emergency care skills and patient outcomes through continued training.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Emergency medicine</kwd><kwd>First aids</kwd><kwd>Medical residents</kwd><kwd>Medical interns</kwd><kwd>Egypt</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Mansoura University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology &#x00026; Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">The ABCDE (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, and Exposure) approach stands as a widely employed and universal method for evaluating and addressing critically unwell emergency patients. Professionals assert that employing the ABCDE approach enhances the timely assessment and treatment of individuals requiring emergency care (1,2). This systematic, step-by-step process facilitates efficient time management and early identification of deterioration, particularly crucial during the &#x0201c;golden hour&#x0201d; &#x02013; the initial hour post-injury or illness onset when resuscitation efforts are most beneficial (3). Suitable for patients of any age, international guidelines recommend the use of this approach whenever there is suspicion of a serious illness or injury, irrespective of the underlying cause. This recommendation is based on the recognition that critical conditions share similarities in medical signs (4).</p><p id="Par7">All health care professionals regardless the specialty have to know how to follow the ABCDE approach in all critically ill, deteriorating or severely injured patients in order to manage any unexpected life-threating problems before moving to the next step of medical assessment.</p><p id="Par8">The critical points of ABCDE algorithm can be summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]:</p><p id="Par9">

</p><p id="Par10">Healthcare professionals must apply their clinical judgement while focusing on the patient as a whole while using the ABCDE strategy. If done correctly, this brief yet thorough assessment can be completed successfully in less than five minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Although the ABCDE approach is highly recommended, there are signs that practice has variable adherence among healthcare professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A randomized clinical trial assessing the adherence to the ABCDE algorithm showed that the overall adherence to the approach was relatively low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In Egypt, there is no study discussing the ABCDE approach knowledge level of health care professionals especially those with direct responsibility in emergency situations, residents and interns. As knowledge is fundamental for hospitality regarding life-saving approaches, assessment of ABCDE knowledge is needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par12">We conducted a cross-sectional study between June 7, 2023 and June 21, 2023 in various hospitals in Mansoura, Menofia, Alexandria, Benisuef, and Assuit governates in Egypt. This survey was based on a validated scale in a previously published study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Data collection depended on convenience and snowball technique. A google form questionnaire was designed and distributed either by delivering the survey to potential respondents face to face or through multiple social media platforms. We clearly elaborated purposes of the study to the participants and stated that it was not obligatory to involve in the study. They were given clear instructions and worked under daily supervision by members of research team and the team leader.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study sample</title><p id="Par13">The study&#x02019;s inclusion criteria were Egyptian medical interns and resident doctors as these two groups more frequently face first aid-demanding situations in medical practice in Egypt. We excluded any uncompleted survey from the study. All participants agreed to enrol into the study with their own will without pressure and were provided with the identity of the research group, their right to discontinue the survey whenever they wanted, the right to data confidentiality, and that only completed valid submissions would be analysed. All these information was provided in the first page of the survey before answering the questions, and data was kept in a secure online database with access to research team only.</p><p id="Par14">A single proportion of the population formula [n = [(Za/2)2P(1-P)]/d2] was applied to detect the minimal sample size needed for the study. With a 95% confidence level (Z a/2&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.96), a 5% margin of error, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;the estimated overall test score among resident doctors and medical interns based on previous literature (80%) (9) and adding 5% for a possible non-response rate, 246 interns and resident doctors were needed to proceed with this study. The final sample size was 422 interns and residents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measures</title><p id="Par15">The survey used in this study comprises two sections, with the first section focusing on sociodemographic data including medical role, specialty, place of medical practice, previous source of knowledge of ABCDE approach and the readiness to participate in life support training in free time, and the second section contained 29 multiple-choices questions assessing the ABCDE approach knowledge, developed and validated by Nino H. C. Schoeber et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] Each question of the test has multiple possible choices, of which only one answer is correct. Each correct answer is considered one point, with a maximum score of 29 points for each participant. To make it simpler to understand the findings, the original 29-point scale was condensed to a 10-point scale. Any respondent scoring below 7.5 points was presumed to have not attained the required degree of theoretical understanding of the ABCDE approach, as those scoring 7.5/10.0 or more were deemed knowledgeable about the ABCDE technique.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ethical consideration</title><p id="Par16">This study was undertaken after the approval of the Mansoura Faculty of Medicine IRB (R.23.03.2101). Respondents received a URL for a Google&#x02019;s online survey via social media, mainly depending on Whatsapp or email and were asked if they consent to complete the survey before the questions starts to show up. When collecting the data face-to-face, the data collector had clear verbal consent from the respondent to participate. All participants were assured that the gathered information would not be used elsewhere but this study. Informed consent for publication was obtained from each participant. Confidentiality and anonymity were maintained in all steps of the study, and all the received data was saved in an online protected database.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par17">Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 26 and Microsoft Excel to derive meaningful insights from the collected data. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were employed to categorize and present sociodemographic characteristics, including medical role, specialty, place of medical practice, previous source of ABCDE approach knowledge, and willingness to participate in life support training during free time. Knowledge levels were classified into &#x0201c;satisfactory&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;unsatisfactory&#x0201d; categories, determined by adjusted cutoff thresholds (above 75% and below 75% of the total score, respectively). To identify any statistical differences in knowledge toward the ABCDE approach, a Test de Kruskal-Wallis was performed, considering a p-value less than 0.05 as statistically significant. This test was specifically applied to assess the association between different subgroups and test scores.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Demographic characteristics</title><p id="Par18">We approached 450 medical interns and residents, of which, 422 completed and returned the questionnaire with a response rate of 93.8% with no missing data. The respondents were nearly distributed equally among 220 (52.1%) residents and 202 (47.9%) interns. In terms of settings of medical practice, University hospitals formed the majority 289 (68.5%) followed by public hospitals 107 (25.4%) and lastly, private practice 26 (6.2%).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par25">To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the theoretical understanding of the ABCDE technique among residents and interns in Egypt, considering these groups are frequently involved in urgent medical emergencies. Despite the strong recommendation of the ABCDE approach, indications suggest varying adherence among healthcare professionals. A previous research in the Netherlands has directly examined theoretical knowledge about the ABCDE technique across different fields, breaking new ground in this aspect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While prior studies have assessed knowledge of the primary survey, they often focused on life support courses rather than the ABCDE approach specifically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Notably, there is a gap in research regarding healthcare workers&#x02019; awareness of the ABCDE strategy in Egypt, especially among interns and residents who bear direct responsibilities in emergency situations. Evaluating ABCDE knowledge becomes imperative as proficiency in life-saving techniques is crucial, particularly within the hospitality industry.</p><p id="Par26">Our study revealed a mean knowledge score of 5.91 and a standard deviation of 1.529, stood at 59.1%. This aligns with findings by Binkhorst and his team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], who noted low retention of Pediatric Basic Life Support (PBLS) abilities among pediatricians and residents during advanced life support scenarios. The inadequate acquisition or retention of knowledge, crucial for adhering to the ABCDE algorithm, may partially explain incomplete or improper implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our knowledge score appears to be 21% lower than Schoeber and his colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] theoretical test-based findings, and 24% lower than Olgers and his team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] hands-on assessment, suggesting wide room for improvement.</p><p id="Par27">Analysis of our survey data, comprising 29 questions, revealed that fewer than half of the participants answered at least questions correctly. This outcome underscores a significant gap in the participants&#x02019; understanding of the subject matter, suggesting areas of potential improvement in their knowledge of the ABCDE approach. The identification of specific questions that posed challenges for participants could provide valuable insights for targeted educational interventions and curriculum enhancements.</p><p id="Par28">Moreover, our study disclosed that only 28.2% of participants had undergone prior ALS/BLS courses, despite 91.2% expressing openness to participating in a life support training program if accessible. While existing research supports the notion that life support courses enhance theoretical knowledge and practical abilities, our findings underscore the necessity of regular practice. Knowledge and skills tend to deteriorate within 3&#x02013;6 months without consistent rehearsal according to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Surprisingly, participants with prior ALS/BLS courses had lower mean scores compared to those who learned about the ABCDE approach through medical school curricula or departmental training. Therefore, our study suggests that the mode of knowledge acquisition may influence the depth of understanding, warranting further exploration into the effectiveness of different educational approaches. In a previous randomized control trial, two different educational methods were assessed. Results of this study suggested that compared to the lecture group, the video-based education group adhered to the ABCDE strategy more closely (4). Such observation may be complementary to our findings in future studies.</p><p id="Par30">A statistically significant correlation emerged between participants&#x02019; test scores and the environment of their medical practice, with public hospitals scoring the highest and private practices the lowest. Interestingly, this contrasts with Schoeber and his team&#x02019;s findings, emphasizes the complexity of linking theoretical knowledge test scores to clinical practice adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Setting a cut score for passing or failing our assessment scale proved challenging, given the difficulty in determining the ideal level of ABCDE approach understanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. While our test served as a threshold-free formative assessment, it illuminated a concerning lack of comprehensive understanding among healthcare workers caring for critically ill patients, as indicated by a wide range of test scores and substantial standard deviations.</p><p id="Par31">Despite the absence of an association between test scores and medical role or specialization in our results, but it was worth noting that surgeons scored the lowest among all participants, warranting further exploration into specialty-specific training needs.</p><sec id="Sec901"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par33">One of the key strengths of this study is its focus on a critical yet understudied area in emergency care, the knowledge of the ABCDE approach among Egyptian residents and interns, who are often the first responders in urgent medical situations. The large, geographically diverse sample size from various hospitals across Egypt enhances the generalizability of the findings. The use of a validated survey tool adds reliability to the data, while the combination of both face-to-face and online data collection ensured a high response rate (93.8%). Moreover, the study&#x02019;s identification of specific gaps in ABCDE knowledge and the significant associations between knowledge levels and practice settings provide valuable insights for improving emergency training programs and developing more targeted educational interventions.</p><p id="Par34">The exclusive focus on knowledge, without incorporating an exploration of the practical application of the ABCDE approach in real-life scenarios, is a notable limitation. Future research should strive for a more comprehensive evaluation that includes both theoretical and practical assessments. Another limitation stems from the reliance on online-reported data, particularly concerning participants&#x02019; sources of ABCDE knowledge and their willingness to engage in life support training. This introduces the potential for recall bias, as participants may not accurately remember or report their educational sources or intentions, affecting the reliability of these findings. Also, generalizability of the findings may be affected by convenience and snowball sampling methods and variations in medical education systems and healthcare practices in different healthcare entities in Egypt. The cross-sectional nature of the study limits the ability to assess knowledge retention or changes over time. A longitudinal study with follow-up assessments could provide insights into the persistence of ABCDE knowledge and the impact of ongoing medical education initiatives.</p><p id="Par35">The study reported lower mean scores for participants who had undergone ALS/BLS courses without delving into the specific content, quality, or duration of these courses. Such limitation raised from unexpectedness of such finding along with concerns regarding recall bias, pre and post interventional assessment would provide a better solution in determining the educational deficit. Lastly, participants may have provided responses perceived as socially desirable, particularly when expressing their willingness to participate in life support training. This potential social desirability bias could impact the accuracy of reported attitudes and intentions.</p><p id="Par36">Acknowledging these limitations is essential for a nuanced interpretation of the study&#x02019;s findings and for guiding future research efforts to address these constraints for a more robust understanding of ABCDE approach knowledge and application.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec902"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par38">The average ABCDE approach knowledge score among medical interns and residents was low revealing specific gaps in understanding. These findings collectively suggest opportunities for targeted educational interventions, particularly in addressing specific knowledge gaps identified in the ABCDE approach. Future initiatives should consider tailoring training programs to different medical settings and exploring innovative methods to enhance the overall proficiency of medical interns and residents in life support skills.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks to Zahraa Mohamed Mustafa Abousobh, Orthogeriatrics junior clinical fellow, James Paget University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Great Yarmouth, UK, in helping disseminate the survey in Egypt.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Mohamed Saad Rakab, Malak Abbas Hamadein, Alaa Samir El-Shamia: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal Analysis, Writing-Original draft, review and editing.Salma Abbas Hamadein, Mahmoud Abd Elgawad Ashour, Dina Ayman Mostafa, Rahma Mogahed Rateb, Marwa Abdelrahman Elashry, Mennat-Allah Mostafa El-Badawy: Conceptualization and Writing the original draft.Dr. Ahmed B.
