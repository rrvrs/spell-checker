These drugs are typically prescribed for individuals with cancer who are under specialized palliative care (PC+). However, it is not known whether their usage is equally common for patients with other chronic and progressive conditions, such as heart failure (HF), or for those who are not under specialized palliative care (PC-).</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p id="Par2">To assess the prescription frequency of each of the four medication types during the final hospitalization of patients with HF and compare it with the prescription frequency in patients with cancer (CA), considering both PC&#x02009;+&#x02009;and PC- patients in each disease group.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par3">A retrospective cohort study included all patients dying in a tertiary hospital between 2016 and 2022. We created three disease groups &#x02013; &#x0201c;HF,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;CA,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;HF&#x00026;CA&#x0201d; &#x02013; splitting each of them into two groups, depending on whether they received PC. So there were a total of six groups &#x02013; &#x0201c;HF PC+&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;HF PC-&#x0201c;, &#x0201c;CA PC+&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;CA PC-&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;HF&#x00026;CA PC+&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;HF&#x00026;CA PC-&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">Of the 3,874 patients, 1,921 (59%) had cancer exclusively, 371 (10%) had heart failure exclusively, and 691 (18%) had both. The median length of stay was 9 days (IQR 2&#x02013;16). Within each diagnosis group, PC&#x02009;+&#x02009;patients had a higher prescription frequency for each medication type than PC- patients. For example, patients who received PC had 12 times the odds of being prescribed opioids than those who did not receive it (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Among the six groups, the highest prescription frequency of opioids, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergics was seen in the &#x0201c;HF PC+&#x0201d; group and the lowest in the &#x0201c;HF PC-&#x0201d; group. Antipsychotics were prescribed less frequently in the &#x0201c;HF PC-&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;CA PC-&#x0201d; groups and were mainly prescribed in the &#x0201c;CA PC+&#x0201d; group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par5">Across the diagnostic groups, a notable difference in the prescription of the four medication types was observed between PC&#x02009;+&#x02009;and PC- patients.

However, there are general recommendations for medications at the end of life that should be prescribed in this phase, either because the patient would benefit from their use at the time or later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These recommendations are intended to cover the most common and most relevant symptoms during the last days of life &#x02013; pain, breathlessness, anxiety, delirium, agitation, nausea, vomiting, and noisy chest secretions. Some medications can help with more than one symptom. For example, levomepromazine can treat delirium, agitation, nausea, and vomiting, and opioids can help with pain, breathlessness, and anxiety.</p><p id="Par7">The proposed types of medication that should be prescribed in the last days of life are opioids, benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, and antipsychotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These types of medications are not an exclusive domain of palliative care specialists. However, due to the greater expertise of these specialists in symptomatic management during advanced stages of disease and the end of life, it is not known whether these medications are mainly prescribed by palliative care specialists or whether physicians with different trainings also prescribe them similarly during the last days of a persons&#x02019; life. Although the use of these four types of medications was initially proposed for people with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], their use has been extended to people with non-oncologic diseases, such as heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, to date, it is not known whether there are differences in the prescription of these four types of medication during the last days of life between people with heart failure and people with cancer. This study focuses specifically on heart failure because it is a chronic, progressive condition with a high symptom burden, frequent hospitalizations, and a unique trajectory that necessitates ongoing palliative care. Unlike other cardiac conditions such as atrial fibrillation, which may be managed with rhythm control strategies, or stroke, which often follows an acute or subacute course with rehabilitation-focused care, heart failure patients experience more non-cardiovascular comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], persistent symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], recurrent exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and a variable decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], making early integration of palliative care essential for improving quality of life. Therefore, our objectives were (1) to compare the frequency of prescription of the four medication types among patients who died from heart failure and those who died from cancer and (2) to compare the frequency of prescription of these drugs among those who received specialized palliative care during their fatal hospitalization with prescriptions among those who did not receive care by that specialty.</p></sec><sec id="Sec112"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par8">We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary university hospital in Switzerland.</p><sec id="Sec214"><title>Data collection and ethics</title><p id="Par9">We collected data from all inpatients who died between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2022, and who consented to the use of their clinical data. With the support of the hospital&#x02019;s data science center, we extracted information from administrative records and medical charts. The data extracted included sociodemographic information, such as sex, age, and marital status, and clinical information, such as main hospitalization diagnosis, comorbidities (secondary diagnosis), length of stay (LOS), medication prescribed (whether or not it was administered), date of death, and whether or not the patient received PC, and, if so, at which time during the hospitalization. The main diagnoses and comorbidities were extracted using ICD-10 codes and medications using their generic names. Patients received PC within the PC ward or in another ward through consultation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec216"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p id="Par10">The inclusion criteria were adult patients (at least 18 years old) who died in the hospital while hospitalized during the previously defined period. We included only patients who had HF or cancer (CA) as the main or secondary diagnosis. We excluded patients who dissented from further use of their medical data, perinatal deaths and deaths caused by accidents or injuries from external causes, and patients who died in ambulatory care or in the intensive care unit. Patients in the ICU were excluded to focus on medication use patterns in routine inpatient care, as ICU settings involve different goals of care, critically ill populations, and unique medication needs that could confound comparisons between heart failure and cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par11">We created categorical variables (yes/no) for HF or cancer based on ICD-10 codes (supplementary material <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

As some patients had both HF and cancer, we created a third group called &#x0201c;HF&#x00026;CA&#x0201d;.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec242"><title>Key findings</title><p id="Par32">Patients who received PC were always more frequently prescribed each of the four types of medication than PC- patients, and having received PC was the main predictor for being prescribed each type of medication. Among the six groups, the highest prescription frequency of opioids, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergics was seen in the &#x0201c;HF PC+&#x0201d; group and the lowest in the &#x0201c;HF PC-&#x0201c;group. Antipsychotics were less frequently prescribed between both HF groups and were mainly and equally prescribed in the &#x0201c;HF&#x00026;CA PC+&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;CA PC+&#x0201d; groups. Overall, having HF was a negative predictor of being prescribed opioids, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergics, whereas having cancer was a positive predictor of being prescribed opioids.</p></sec><sec id="Sec244"><title>Medication prescriptions</title><p id="Par33">Evaluating the frequency of use of certain medications does not necessarily allow us to evaluate the quality of clinical practice. Moreover, not using these medications does not mean that there was a deficiency in clinical practice or that there was a failure in symptom control in patients in whom they were not used, since the medications may not have been indicated or the patients may have refused the use of some of them, such as sedatives. However, it is important to emphasize that in this study, we evaluated the frequency with which the medications were prescribed, not with which they were administered. In this particular case, our results suggest that there was a low anticipatory prescription, which is recommended, of these four types of medications among patients who did not receive PC, especially among those with HF. It is interesting how the prescription frequency of medications was highest among patients with HF who received PC and lowest among patients with HF but without PC. One possible explanation is that HF PC&#x02009;+&#x02009;patients had the most complex symptoms, as they had multiple comorbidities. However, even though this group of patients had the highest overall prevalence of CKD, dementia, and COPD, patients with HF were older than patients with cancer and had more comorbidities, regardless of whether they received PC. This high chance of physical suffering due to age-related frailty and comorbidities is one of the possible reasons patients with HF have comparable or even higher PC needs compared to patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The reasons for this large discrepancy in medication use between HF and cancer remain to be explained in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec246"><title>Low and late referral to specialized palliative care</title><p id="Par34">In our study, very few patients with HF received PC during fatal hospitalization (4% vs. 32% in cancer). Additionally, HF patients received PC later during their hospitalization (at the sixth day vs. third day in cancer) and closer to death: the median time during which HF patients received PC was four days compared to seven days in cancer. Numerous studies have shown that specialized palliative care is underutilized in the HF population, even in the dying phase. A study that used data from the National Health Service in Great Britain found that only 7% of patients with HF received PC before dying, compared to 48% of patients with cancer, and that those with HF received it much closer to death than patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Similarly, a study conducted in the United States found that patients with HF enroll in hospices at lower rates compared with patients with cancer and closer to death, typically around 3 days before death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Underutilization can be attributed to several factors, including difficulties identifying the end-of-life phase in patients with HF, which has been commonly described as a barrier to delivering PC or end-of-life care to these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, our data showed a longer LOS for patients who received PC across all diagnosis groups. This suggests that a less steep decline with a longer LOS facilitates the identification of a terminal phase, initiation of comfort measures and treatment, and referral to PC. In fact, we found that the odds of being prescribed opioids increased nine times for each hospitalization day. Although the most marked association between LOS and medication was for opioids, a longer LOS was also positively and statistically significantly associated with being prescribed the remaining three types of medication. Not only does it take time to identify the active dying phase, but a PC intervention also takes time to be effective and bring significant benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. If patients with HF tend to experience steep clinical decline, it is of great importance to provide early PC in this specific population.</p><p id="Par35">Another factor that could have contributed to the low PC referral among &#x0201c;HF&#x0201d; patients is the lack of awareness and training among cardiologists regarding the potential benefits of PC in patients with HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Addressing these barriers by educating and training all HF professionals in basic PC skills may be crucial to improving the integration of PC in the management of this disease, especially during the last days of life.</p><p id="Par36">Finally, this study shows only moderate medical integration between cardiology and specialized palliative care services in our institution. This is often the case in other institutions and countries. The latest European atlas of PC services showed that only eight countries on the continent have cardiology services offering PC and that collaboration between both services rarely occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, a study carried out in Italy showed not only a few services offering specialized palliative care, but end-of-life care of any kind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Our data show the need to strengthen cooperation between cardiology and specialized palliative care services and to promote a PC approach (generalist PC) in the practice of cardiologists, internists, general practitioners, nurses, and other health care professionals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec250"><title>Sex and gender differences in specialized palliative care referrals</title><p id="Par37">Although approximately half of the patients with HF included in our study were women, only 25% of those who received PC were women. That is, men with HF received three times as much PC as women with HF. This finding is interesting, as several studies have shown that women with HF have more symptoms, more unmet needs, and a lower quality of life than men with HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, women often outlive their male partners, which has been described as one of the causes why men die mainly at home in the care of their wife and family or in the hospital if there is a situation that the caregiver does not know how to handle at home. Women, in contrast, are often more institutionalized than men and therefore die mostly in such institutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In fact, a study conducted in Switzerland showed that in the German region of the country in which our hospital is located, most women die in nursing homes irrespective of age and have half the odds of dying in a hospital as compared to men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Nursing homes or similar institutions usually do not have PC specialists. Therefore, to ensure equitable access to specialized palliative care, it is important to implement mobile palliative care services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec252"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par38">We used administrative records to identify all patients who had died in a tertiary hospital from cancer or HF for seven years. Therefore, even after applying the exclusion and inclusion criteria, we managed to include data from almost 3,000 patients in our analysis. This significant sample size allowed us to compare the medications not only by disease or palliative care status, as is traditionally done, but we could also test the differences across the interactions between both characteristics (disease category and specialized palliative care status). This type of analysis allowed us to identify the biggest determinants of medication prescriptions.</p><p id="Par39">Unfortunately, we did not have information about the treating specialty. For example, many of the patients with HF at our institution are hospitalized in the internal medicine ward. This could also be the case for patients with cancer. Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions about the prescription practice in oncology or cardiology but only draw conclusions according to the diagnosis and whether or not they received specialized palliative care.</p><p id="Par40">Finally, we did not include HF-related variables, such as cardiac function measures, functional class, or symptoms, in our regression analysis for further adjustment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par41">Across the diagnostic groups, a notable difference in the usage of the four medication types was observed between the PC&#x02009;+&#x02009;and PC- patients. This difference was more pronounced among patients with HF (without cancer). These results suggest that the prescription of these medications is mainly in the hands of palliative care specialists, and on a non-palliative care specialist level, these medications are incorporated more into the routine care of patients with cancer than in patients with heart failure. This study underscores the need to provide early specialized palliative care to patients with heart failure due to their shorter hospitalization, which allows little room to adequately identify and treat the end of life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
