OVC, often referred to as Ackerman's tumor, has been known to involve lymph nodes but rarely spreads to regional and distant locations; when the primary tumor grows, it frequently involves surrounding tissues. Histopathologically, it has a thicker&#x000a0;basement membrane, many reduplications, and a large area of inflammatory infiltration that resembles OSCC. Therefore, precise histological diagnosis of verrucous carcinoma is crucial as helps in identifying tumors with a higher propensity to develop into OSCC. In cancer progression, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the most important stage. One factor influencing EMT is epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin). Thus, it is imperative to identify indicators that can facilitate the detection of lesions with the potential to progress into OSCC.</p><p>Aim</p><p>This study aimed to identify the expression of E-cadherin&#x000a0;in normal mucosa and verrucous carcinoma and determine its&#x000a0;role in the progression of the lesion.</p><p>Methodology</p><p>A total of 15 subjects with normal mucosa and 15 subjects with verrucous carcinoma were histopathologically examined and confirmed.

Histopathologically, OVC displays a thicker basement membrane with reduplication in many locations and significant inflammatory infiltrate, similar to OSCC [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Consequently, an accurate histological diagnosis of verrucous carcinoma is essential, as it facilitates the recognition of tumors with an increased likelihood of advancing to OSCC [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) represents a multi-step process that enables epithelial cells to undergo a series of biochemical changes, resulting in their transformation into a mesenchymal phenotype. These epithelial cell-to-cell interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular polarity and tissue integrity. The junctional complex, consisting of tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes, plays a key role in this process. Cadherins, the primary adhesion molecules in adherens junctions, are essential for regulating the overall activity of the junctional complex. Modifications in the interaction between the basal cell layers and the basement membrane, such as enhanced migratory capacity, increased invasiveness, heightened resistance to apoptosis, and significantly elevated production of extracellular matrix components, are hallmarks of cancer progression. Most cancers, including OSCC, undergo invasion and metastasis, which requires the loss of cell-to-cell adhesion [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, identifying a reliable marker that can help detect lesions with the potential to progress into OSCC is critical for early diagnosis and effective treatment.</p><p>E-cadherin, a 120-kDa calcium-dependent cell-surface glycoprotein, plays a crucial role in mediating adhesion between epithelial cells, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. It functions as a key biomarker for suppressing growth and proliferation, contributing significantly to the maintenance of tissue architecture and cellular homeostasis. The suppression of E-cadherin expression is regarded as one of the main molecular events responsible for dysfunction in cell-cell adhesion. The expression of E-cadherin has been quite variable in various studies on oral and extraoral lesions [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Thus, the objective of this work was to examine the expression of E-cadherin and assess its functional role in OVC and normal oral mucosa, to enhance the understanding of its importance in tumor growth and cellular differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This was a study conducted at Sri Dharmasthala Manjunatheswara College of Dental Sciences &#x00026; Hospital, Dharwad, Karnataka, India, from February 2018 to January 2019. The study was approved by Sri Dharmasthala Manjunatheswara College of Dental Sciences &#x00026; Hospital, Dharwad, Karnataka, India (approval number: 2016/P/OP/50).</p><p>The study included 30 histopathologically verified cases, comprising 15 cases of normal oral mucosa (Group 1) and 15 cases of oral verrucous carcinoma (Group 2). Participants were of all age groups and of both genders. Individuals without a history of habit or who were not histologically verified were excluded.</p><p>The minimum sample size of 15 OVC and 15 normal mucosa was found to be sufficient to obtain alpha of 0.05, a power of 80%, and effect size of 0.2 (Cohen&#x02019;s d).</p><p>Two sections were extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of primary lesions in Group 2. One part was stained with hematoxylin and eosin for general histopathological evaluation while the other section underwent immunohistochemistry to confirm the histopathological diagnosis of the cases. The paraffin-embedded tissue blocks for the investigation were obtained from the archives of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology and Microbiology at Sri Dharmasthala Manjunatheswara College of Dental Sciences &#x00026; Hospital. Normal oral mucosal tissues for Group 1 were procured after the surgical extraction of impacted teeth, with the full consent of the patients. Clinical information of patients was retrieved from the department's database. The exclusion criteria encompassed tissue samples with inadequate epithelial or connective tissue depth, folded or necrotic regions, recurrent instances of oral verrucous carcinoma, and cases devoid of acceptable clinical data.</p><p>Procedure</p><p>Immunohistochemical Staining</p><p>For immunohistochemical staining, the primary antibody used was E-cadherin rabbit monoclonal antibody (Clone EPR4120, IgG immunoglobulin). Staining was conducted in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (BioGenex Life Sciences Pvt Ltd, Adibatla, Telangana, India).</p><p>Staining interpretation:As observed in our positive control sections, the presence of a brown-colored end product at the target antigen location was regarded as positive immunoreactivity. Membranous staining, membranous, and cytoplasmic staining for E-cadherin were considered positive. Cytoplasmic staining alone and unstained cells for E-cadherin were considered negative.</p><p>Defining the field for cell counting:In each group, areas of the primary lesions were scanned using low-power magnification. At a greater magnification (x40), folded sections and areas that were not recognizable for counting were noted and excluded from counting.</p><p>Cell counting: Counting was done using a binocular light microscope with high-power magnification (x40). Immunoreactivity was evaluated quantitatively on the basis of distribution and staining intensity. In normal oral mucosa and oral verrucous carcinoma, the total number of cells counted was 1000 cells.

Cell adhesion molecules, including cadherins, integrins, selectins, and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, govern the epithelial phenotype by promoting homophilic cell attachment and preserving cellular polarity [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Cadherins constitute a substantial family of molecules that facilitate cell-to-cell adhesion via calcium-dependent homophilic interactions. E-cadherin, a traditional cadherin, is a crucial element of adherens junctions, functioning as a 120 kD glycoprotein that promotes epithelial cell adhesion through homotypic, calcium-dependent interactions [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This molecule is crucial for preserving epithelial integrity, and facilitating tissue morphogenesis, differentiation, and cell segregation, all of which are vital for the form and function of epithelial tissues [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Consistent strong pericellular staining of E-cadherin has been detected in the basal, suprabasal, and prickle cell layers of normal and hyperplastic epithelium, as shown in numerous studies [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Conversely, the keratinizing superficial layers have a deficiency in E-cadherin expression [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The decrease in E-cadherin expression is believed to contribute to the proper desquamation of epithelial cells, although the precise mechanisms governing its expression in the top layers are not well understood. Tyrosine phosphorylation during normal cell migration might trigger the disassembly of the E-cadherin-catenin complex, resulting in the delocalization of membrane-associated E-cadherin from adherens junctions. The phosphorylation of the E-cadherin-catenin complex, especially &#x003b2;-catenin, primarily mediates this process [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>OVC, a subtype of squamous cell carcinoma, is typically less malignant than other variants of this disease and represents 2-16% of all oral carcinoma. Clinically, the lesion typically exhibits a pebbly, mamillated, or rugal-folded morphology, characterized by deep cleft-like regions that delineate these folds [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Microscopically, it is marked by a significant inflammatory response in the adjacent tissues, notable surface keratinization, and the downward extension of club-shaped projections of hyperplastic epithelium. These epithelial projections extend into the adjacent tissues without deeply penetrating them, frequently preserving an unbroken basement membrane. In mature stages, OVC typically invades neighboring structures with low mitotic activity, exhibits slow growth, and infrequently metastasizes [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The rapid growth of tumors and the initiation of metastasis in several carcinoma types, including those of the head and neck, have been associated with aberrant E-cadherin expression [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. E-cadherin is crucial for cell adhesion, and its impairment is frequently linked to heightened tumor invasiveness and metastatic capability.</p><p>The present study found membrane, cytoplasmic, and solely cytoplasmic immunostaining of E-cadherin, consistent with the results of Sridevi and associates [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Multiple variables may influence the modified localization of E-cadherin, including enhanced production rate, failure to translocate, or inability to bind to the cell membrane. This positional change may correlate with staining patterns observed in non-cancerous situations, wherein the desmosomal glycoprotein in membrane vesicles experiences endocytosis and remains aggregated with plaque components due to the disintegration of intercellular connections. As these membrane vesicles deteriorate, the cytoplasmic staining gets dispersed.</p><p>The current study revealed that the majority of participants in both categories were men, aged over 50. This was perhaps due to the greater prevalence of habitual risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol consumption among men in India compared to women [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Kruse et al. observed that few studies have indicated a majority of female participants [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This may result from a change in behavioral patterns, as an increasing proportion of young women are being exposed to alcohol and tobacco use.</p><p>The buccal mucosa was determined to be the predominant site for the majority of lesions, with supplementary involvement observed in the lip, gingiva, and floor of the mouth. The research indicates that the preference for buccal mucosa may stem from extended exposure to tobacco and its components, which serve as a continual source of mucosal irritation and lesion development. Comparable results were documented by Kristofelc et al. [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This investigation found no significant association between the lesion site and E-cadherin expression, aligning with the results published by Andrews et al. [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Conversely, studies conducted by Tanaka et al. identified the tongue as the principal site of lesions, which differs from the current study, and similarly found no link between lesion location and E-cadherin expression [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This underscores the heterogeneity in lesion locations among various studies; however, the absence of association with E-cadherin expression remains constant.</p><p>According to Tang et al., E-cadherin expression in OVC (83.3%) was markedly lower than in poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (37.5%) [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Klieb et al. reported widespread membranous staining across the epithelium in all instances of OVC and oral verrucous hyperplasia, indicating that modifications in adhesion molecules may be indicative of advanced stages of carcinogenesis [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These findings underscore the significance of E-cadherin alteration in tumor advancement.</p><p>Our study revealed no significant difference in E-cadherin expression between normal mucosa and verrucous carcinoma. This study indicates that, despite the unique histological characteristics of verrucous carcinoma, the expression of E-cadherin may not significantly differ from that of normal oral mucosa. This outcome may suggest that E-cadherin's efficacy as a biomarker in differentiating between these two situations is restricted, necessitating additional exploration of alternative markers or factors affecting tumor behavior.</p><p>The E-cadherin protein, produced by the <italic>CDH1</italic> gene, may be inactivated in human malignant tumors via various processes, including somatic mutations, genetic abnormalities, activation of transcriptional repressors, abnormal protein processing, and promoter hypermethylation. The reduction or lack of E-cadherin expression promotes EMT, a process in which epithelial cells gain motility and invasiveness, hence increasing their capacity to invade neighboring tissues and contribute to tumor invasion and metastasis [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. E-cadherin expression is widely acknowledged as a vital marker for EMT in tumor growth, highlighting its importance in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.</p><p>Zhang et al. showed that the downregulation of E-cadherin expression adversely affects cell adhesion, resulting in heightened infiltration, dispersion, and metastasis of tumor cells [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This discovery indicates that E-cadherin is essential for preserving epithelial integrity and inhibiting malignant development. Thus, E-cadherin expression may function as a significant prognostic marker for individuals with verrucous carcinoma. Further research is necessary to confirm these findings and determine the clinical significance of E-cadherin as a prognostic factor in this situation.</p><p>Limitations of the study</p><p>Several limitations must be considered in our study. Firstly, due to the small sample size, the generalizability of the findings could be affected. Using a panel of markers instead of only one IHC marker could improve the study's outcomes. Additionally, variations in tissue processing and IHC staining techniques could introduce potential sources of error.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>OVC is a low-grade variant of squamous cell carcinoma, but it may transform&#x000a0;into frank OSCC.
