This physical impact can alter patients &#x02018;mental health and lead to anxiety or depression.</p></sec><sec id="sec6541"><title>Objectives</title><p>This study aimed to assess the mental health in patients diagnosed with paget&#x02019;s bone disease</p></sec><sec id="sec6542"><title>Methods</title><p>Paget&#x02019;s disease patients were assessed by The Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF) score. It consists of 14 items that were selected to represent each fact of well-being: 3 emotional well-being items (reflects hedonic well-being), 6 psychological well-being items, and 5 social well-being items (when combined, reflects eudemonic well-being). Items scores are summed, yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 70. Higher scores indicate greater levels of positive well-being.</p></sec><sec id="sec6543"><title>Results</title><p>
Thirty patients were included. 60% were men and 40% were women. The average age was 65 years. Socio-economic level was low in 3.3%, average in 86.7%, good in 10% of cases. 93.3% were married and 6.7% were single. For the medical history, 80% had a previous history and 20% did not. Clinically, 83.3% had pain and 16.7% had no pain. Concerning the disease location, 4 had involvement of the skull, 15 of the spine, 13 of the sacrum, 13 of the femur, 1 of the tibia, 1 of the calcaneus and 3 of the humerus. As for complications, 36.7% had no complications, 56.7% had osteoarticular complications, 3.3% had neurological complications and 3.3% had cardio-vascular complications. Concerning treatment, 90% received bisphosphonate and 10% did not.</p><p>For the mental health questionnaire, the mean score was 36.4.</p><p>53.3% of patients had poor mental health, 43.3% were moderately healthy and 3.3% were thriving.</p><p>No significant associations were noted between level of mental health and age, pain level, complications,&#x000a0;location of the disease, alkaline phosphatase and&#x000a0;treatment p&#x0003e;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="sec6544"><title>Conclusions</title><p>
The impact of paget&#x02019;s disease is not only physical but also psychological. The MHC-SF is useful to detect the mental illness.</p></sec><sec id="sec6545"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
