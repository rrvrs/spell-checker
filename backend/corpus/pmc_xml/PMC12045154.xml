Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomic technologies have unlocked the potential to map genome-wide gene-expression patterns across tissues at single-cell and even subcellular resolutions [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref>]. Despite their transformative potential, existing technologies each addresses only certain aspects of the underlying challenges, with inherent limitations in scope and resolution. <italic toggle="yes">In situ</italic> hybridization technologies, such as MERFISH [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], smFISH (osmFISH) [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and sequential FISH (seqFISH+) [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], offer high resolution but are confined to detecting a predefined set of genes. Similarly, <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> sequencing approaches, such as FISSEQ [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], BaristaSeq [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and STARmap [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], require predefined gene panels that are specific to tissue types, limiting their adaptability. In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> capturing technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics ST/Visium [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], Slide-seq [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Stereo-seq [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], offer near-comprehensive transcriptome coverage but generally exhibit low capture efficiency and spatial resolutions at or above the single-cell scale. To address these limitations, recent strategies have centered on computationally integrating spatial measurements with single-cell transcriptomic data [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These techniques leverage cell-type signatures or variable genes that are identified through single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq), facilitating the annotation of spatial transcriptomic data sets with cell-type labels. For instance, robust cell type decomposition (RCTD) [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] employs statistical models and maximum-likelihood estimation to infer cell-type proportions, whereas SpatialDWLS [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] applies damped weighted least squares for similar purposes. Seurat [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] utilizes a weighted nearest-neighbor approach to integrate data, while DestVI [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Cell2location [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] adopt a Bayesian hierarchical framework in conjunction with variational inference. In addition, deep-learning-based approaches such as Tangram [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Spatial-ID [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] have shown promise in processing spatial transcriptomic data with improved precision.</p><p>The brain is an exceptionally complex organ, characterized by heterogeneous cell types that vary significantly across different regions. One of the main challenges in understanding the neural circuits and mechanisms responsible for complex behaviors and neurological diseases is the lack of detailed spatial resolution in cell-type composition and gene-expression data. To address this, we have focused our efforts on applying a novel algorithm to brain tissue, aiming to uncover cellular heterogeneity with higher precision, and conducted preliminary tests on tumor samples to evaluate the broader applicability of the algorithm to other complex tissue types. As spatial omics data continue to expand rapidly, the computational demands and time-intensive nature of current methods pose significant barriers to their practical application. Although multiple approaches for mapping spatial transcriptomic data have been proposed, no method has yet achieved fine-grained cell-type mapping across multiple species and platforms. Herein, we introduce Deep Neural Network-based Spatial Cell Typing (DSCT)&#x02014;a novel methodology that integrates a lightweight deep neural network model and an attention mechanism [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] to accurately infer detailed cell types from spatial transcriptomic data of the brain. Compared with other deep-learning methods, such as Tangram [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which utilizes an optimized mapping strategy, or Spatial-ID [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which employs a Graph Convolutional Network model, DSCT is built upon an efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based neural network architecture. This design, enhanced by streamlined layers and residual connections, significantly improves the transmission of model parameters, expedites escape from local minima and improves accuracy by capturing complex, non-linear relationships in the data. The architectural advantages of DSCT result in significantly faster computational speed and reduced resource consumption compared with existing methods. Furthermore, its attention-based gene-selection mechanism effectively captures key gene-expression features, thereby reducing noise and enhancing model performance. As a result, DSCT provides highly accurate and resource-efficient computational solutions for spatial transcriptomics. Moreover, DSCT has demonstrated consistent accuracy and stability across multiple platforms, ensuring reliable results for various spatial transcriptomic data sets.</p><p>In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of DSCT across brain sections that were derived from different regions, species and spatial transcriptomic platforms. Results demonstrated that DSCT outperformed other computational integration methods in terms of accuracy, producing fine-grained cellular maps of diverse brain tissues. Furthermore, DSCT demonstrated remarkable processing speed and required minimal memory resources, enabling tasks that traditionally require high-performance computing resources to be completed on standard desktop computers. This advancement represents a robust, efficient and versatile approach to integrating single-cell multi-omics data, offering simplicity, speed and accuracy across diverse applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Workflow of DSCT</title><p>Due to the complex and highly heterogeneous nature of the nervous system, annotating spatial cell types in brain spatial transcriptomic data presents a great challenge. Here, we introduce a comprehensive workflow for spatial cell typing, designated as DSCT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Initially, DSCT requires inputting scRNA/single-nucleus (snRNA)-seq data annotated with cell-type information alongside raw spatial transcriptomic data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1a&#x02013;c</xref>). Subsequently, DSCT filters and retains genes that are co-expressed in both sc/snRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic data sets. During this filtering process, an attention mechanism is applied to the selection of feature genes. By applying weights that are derived from training on labeled sc/snRNA-seq data with the attention mechanism, the importance of the feature genes is ranked, allowing their selective retention in sequence. Following this, the filtered sc/snRNA-seq data set is used to construct a sophisticated lightweight deep neural network model comprising five hidden layers. This model boasts a fully connected architecture with initial and terminal stage connections inspired by the ResNet [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] philosophy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). This architectural choice facilitates not only uninterrupted information flow across the network, but also the ability to capture and leverage residual learning, thereby enhancing model performance and its ability to discover complex biological patterns precisely and efficiently. The cross-entropy loss function [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] is employed to compute loss during forward propagation and the Adagrad optimizer [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] is applied in backward propagation for calculating loss gradients and updating parameters. The application of this trained synergistic model to spatial transcriptomic data yields a probability distribution matrix for cell types within the data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Deep Neural Network-based Spatial Cell Typing (DSCT) workflow.

The filtered genes are then input into a deep neural network for training, with the trained model finally used to predict cell types in the spatial transcriptomic data. (e) Spatial cell-typing results acquired by DSCT at spot and single-cell resolutions. (f) Establishment of evaluation system integrating five distinct metrics: PPMC, COS, SSIM, KL and JS, designed to quantitatively assess the precision of spatial transcriptomic data predictions.

(g) Acc Score of different algorithms across the brain spatial transcriptomic data sets that we used (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9) through various mapping methods.

(h) Rank of the metrics by using different gene-selection methods across the brain spatial transcriptomic data sets that we used (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9). The bars represent the average rank, with error bars indicating variability across different data sets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nwaf030fig1" position="float"/></fig><p>To evaluate the accuracy of the predicted distribution, a specialized multi-metric evaluation system is established by combining multiple similarity indices, including cosine similarity (COS) [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] to measure their directional similarity, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMC) [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to assess linear relationships, structural similarity (SSIM) [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] to evaluate the consistency of structural information and Kullback&#x02013;Leibler Divergence (KL) [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to quantify information loss (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Then, the rankings of the results are averaged to serve as our accuracy score (Acc Score) [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This integrative approach enables a comprehensive and objective assessment of the spatial typing results that are obtained by using different computational methods.</p><p>As we all know, marker genes selection is critical for accurate spatial cell typing. There have already been many algorithms available for marker gene selection, including, Seurat [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], Scanpy [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and COSG [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These traditional methods, especially Seurat and Scanpy, often tend to capture highly expressed feature genes, but they lack specificity and offer limited adaptability in parameter selection. In contrast, the COSG method demonstrates better capability in identifying feature genes with greater cell-type specificity. Additionally, the parameter settings in COSG provide the flexibility for adjustments to balance the specificity and expression of feature genes across cell types. To further adapt it for the neural network framework of our DSCT, we have enhanced COSG with an attention mechanism, which we called ACOSG. This integration aims to utilize a deep-learning perspective for more effective feature gene identification, which can help DSCT to accurately and efficiently recognize the spatial gene-expression features in the brain tissue.</p><p>To better evaluate the performance of ACOSG, we utilized previously reported typical data sets, including spatial transcriptomic data sets from (i) different platforms (Slide-seq [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Stereo-seq [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], MERFISH [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], 10x Visium [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], STARmap [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]), (ii) different brain regions (hippocampus [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], cerebellar [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], olfactory bulb [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], cerebral cortex [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]), (iii) different species (human and mouse [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]) and corresponding sc/snRNA-seq data sets [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] for cell typing. In our results, ACOSG achieves higher precision in spatial cell typing, as evidenced by its better performance across multiple evaluation metrics compared with other gene-selection strategies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1g and h</xref>). Specifically, we compared Acc Score, which combined four metrics across different gene-selection algorithms for all data sets. The box plot showed that the ACOSG demonstrated optimal performance compared with the others (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>), indicating its notable effectiveness in gene selection across diverse data sets. Moreover, in separate metrics, our ACOSG method ranks first in the COS, PMCC and SSIM indices, and, in the KL index, it ranks second, showing overall strong performance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>DSCT exhibits faster computing speed and requires fewer computing resources compared with other methods</title><p>Efficiency in terms of running time and memory usage is a critical consideration for bioinformaticians, particularly in the context of large data sets.

In contrast, although Tangram also demonstrated a rapid processing time for spatial cell-type prediction of CB data (15.6&#x000a0;s), it did not match DSCT in accuracy (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, and&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3e and g</xref>). For the OB data, DSCT completed predictions in 1% of the time required by other high-performance methods, such as DestVI (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). Even in a central processing unit (CPU)-based environment, DSCT maintained remarkable efficiency, requiring only 3.8&#x000a0;s for CB data and 29.5&#x000a0;s for OB data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2b and c</xref>), which is significantly faster than the time required by other methods, which ranged from 120&#x000a0;s for Seurat to &#x0003e;3&#x000a0;h for Spatial-ID (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2b and c</xref>).

Certain methods, such as SpatialDWLS and Tangram, far exceeded standard memory and video memory-usage capacities. For example, DSCT required only 8.2 GB of runtime memory, while SpatialDWLS required 123.4 GB to process OB data, which is far beyond the memory capacity of typical computers. Among the GPU-related methods, DSCT required only 1.9 GB of video memory to process OB data, while Tangram required 31.0 GB of runtime video memory, necessitating a server-level graphics card. The evaluation of space consumption for all methods (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>) confirmed that the efficiency of DSCT in hardware usage far exceeded that of other methods, thereby reducing the technical threshold in research processes. Notably, in all tests, DSCT operated smoothly on a standard home computer, indicating that researchers do not require cutting-edge laboratory equipment to perform accurate and rapid cell typing of spatial transcriptomic data.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Application of DSCT to spatial transcriptomic data sets from different brain regions</title><p>The diversity of cell types organized in different brain regions ensures that each region can execute its specific functions. However, the specialization of cell types poses a challenge for consistent spatial cell typing across different brain regions. To assess its predictive accuracy and efficiency across diverse brain areas, we applied the DSCT model to previously published snRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic data sets (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>) acquired using the 10x Genomics and Stereo-seq platforms, respectively [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Typical brain regions were selected, including the olfactory bulb (OB), hippocampus (HIP) and cerebellum (CB), which are characterized by distinct embryological origins and functional modules, encompassing a wide array of diverse cell types (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Initially, the DSCT method was employed to generate a comprehensive spatial transcriptomic cell-type distribution matrix (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). This matrix was then mapped back to its original spatial loci, successfully reproducing the inherent spatial organization patterns of neuronal and non-neuronal cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Notably, the DSCT model showed excellent performance compared with other widely reported algorithms, demonstrating exceptional functioning in both quantitative and qualitative dimensions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3c&#x02013;g</xref>).</p><p>Based on the prediction results that were obtained using the DSCT model, we successfully distinguished the tissue structure characterized by specific cell types in the three brain regions of interest (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). In the CB section, granule cells, molecular layer interneurons and Purkinje cells exhibited a distinct layered distribution (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3b and c</xref>). Among the non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes (Astro), oligodendrocytes (Oligo), vascular leptomeningeal cells (VLMCs), Bergmann cells and microglia (Micro), Astro and Micro showed a more uniform distribution throughout the tissue whereas VLMCs and Oligo were primarily located in the outermost and innermost tissue layers, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3b and c</xref>). Remarkably, Bergmann cells were specifically distributed along the Purkinje layer, corroborating earlier reports [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the HIP and OB sections, the DSCT predictions also revealed regional or layered distribution patterns of cell types (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Specifically, within the HIP data set, distinct structures of the cornu ammonis (CA) regions and dentate gyrus (DG) were evident, especially CA2&#x02014;a small structure that is located between CA1 and CA3 (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2a</xref>)&#x02014;which was reminiscent of the expression of marker genes in the HIP (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2b</xref>). Similarly, in the OB, the DSCT predictions replicated the layered distribution characteristics of granule cells, tufted/mitral cells, glomerular layer cells and olfactory ensheathing cells (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2d</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">e</xref>). These observations align with established biological knowledge, reflecting the organizational patterns of cell types within tissues and emphasizing the accuracy of the DSCT method.</p><p>In evaluating cell-type-distribution accuracy, particular attention was paid to Purkinje and Bergmann cells within the CB region, given their specific concentration in the Purkinje layer within the CB (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) results of cell-type markers that are available from the Allen Brain Atlas served as a reference (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The arrangement of Bergmann cells was observed to be denser and more dispersed compared with that of Purkinje cells. This observation is consistent with the DSCT prediction results, providing indirect validation of its reliability and accuracy. For a more comprehensive comparison of accuracy within the CB region, several widely reported spatial cell-typing methods were selected for prediction and comparison (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Results showed that the DSCT predictions more closely aligned with the biological characteristics of CB cell types, particularly in terms of the spatial distribution of Purkinje and Bergmann cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). An exploration was conducted to examine the proportions of Purkinje and Bergmann cells as predicted by various methods and compare these to the proportions of cell types observed in single-cell transcriptomic data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). Findings revealed that the DSCT predictions most closely matched the cell-type ratio of Purkinje and Bergmann cells in the reference single-cell transcriptomic data, highlighting the precision of the DSCT method. Quantitatively, the highest accuracy (Acc) score achieved by the DSCT model in the CB data further underscored the accuracy of its spatial cell typing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). Similarly, for assessing cell-type-prediction accuracy in the HIP and OB data sets, DSCT demonstrated superiority within the Acc Score quantitative evaluation framework (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>) and exhibited more biologically plausible distribution patterns (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2c</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">f</xref>). This accuracy across different brain regions emphasizes the robustness of the DSCT method, further establishing its utility in cell-type prediction and spatial-distribution analysis.</p><p>In summary, the DSCT method demonstrated a high degree of stability and precision across various brain regions, affirming its reliability in cell-type identification and spatial-distribution prediction, and underscoring its considerable potential for intricate brain-tissue analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Application of DSCT to hippocampal spatial transcriptomic data sets from different platforms</title><p>The rapid development of spatial transcriptomic technology has led to the emergence of various spatial sequencing methods and corresponding platforms, posing major challenges to the universality and stability of spatial cell-typing methods across these diverse platforms. To ascertain the versatility and adaptability of the DSCT method across different platforms, we investigated four distinct technologies: Stereo-seq [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], Slide-seq [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], 10x Visium [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and STARmap [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The HIP was selected as the focus area due to its typical distribution of cell types. Application of the DSCT model to the HIP data sets of each platform precisely mapped the territories of distinct cell types in each data set and clearly distinguished neuronal populations within the CA1, CA2, CA3 and DG regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In the Stereo-seq, Slide-seq and STARmap platform data sets, which provide near-cellular resolution, DSCT distinguished finer GABAergic neuronal and non-neuronal cell types, such as <italic toggle="yes">Pvalb</italic>-, <italic toggle="yes">Vip</italic>- and <italic toggle="yes">Htr3a</italic>-positive GABAergic neurons and Astro. On the lower-resolution 10x Visium platform (generally containing 1&#x02013;10&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;cells per spot), DSCT reconstructed the spatial distribution of HIP cell types, consistently with the corresponding hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E)-stained images (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Superior performance of DSCT across different spatial sequencing platforms.

The initial focus was on CA and DG cells, comparing their predicted cell-type distribution and expression patterns of marker genes in the HIP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). These marker genes were selected based on the top 20 differentially expressed genes for each cell type. A comprehensive comparison was performed across all platforms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3a&#x02013;c</xref>), revealing marked consistency between the predicted distribution of cell types and the expression patterns of marker genes across all platforms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The Slide-seq platform effectively captured enough immature neurons. The DSCT predictions indicated that these immature neurons were mainly distributed in the subgranular zone of the DG, consistently with marker gene-expression patterns of immature neurons in previous reports [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). The subiculum was only observed in the Stereo-seq platform (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The DSCT predictions indicated that the subiculum cells were precisely located on the subiculum structure, consistently with the spatial expression patterns of subiculum cell marker genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Even on the 10x Visium platform with spot resolution, the DSCT method demonstrated excellent performance, providing precise and reliable predictions of cell-type distribution (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3c</xref>). These results collectively underscore the robustness and accuracy of the DSCT method across different platforms, even in the challenging context of spot-resolution analysis.</p><p>To compare the prediction accuracy of different spatial cell-typing methods, various algorithms were tested across four different platforms (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figs S2c</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3d&#x02013;f</xref>). Evaluation of the prediction outcomes across all platforms revealed that DSCT not only accurately identified CA and DG cell types across all four platforms, but also accurately predicted other cell types such as GABAergic neurons and non-neuronal cells. Notably, DSCT was the sole method that was capable of precisely capturing CA and DG cells across all evaluated platforms. While the RCTD method also successfully predicted CA and DG cells across all platforms, it misidentified a high number of immature neurons, possibly mistaking some Astro as immature neurons. These findings suggest that DSCT is more effective at distinguishing cell types with similar gene-expression patterns. The previously established Acc Score criteria were further applied to quantitatively assess the performance of the different methods across the different platforms. Results showed that DSCT achieved the highest scores on all platforms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). These data qualitatively and quantitatively confirmed the accuracy and stability of the DSCT algorithm across multiple platforms, highlighting its excellent recognition ability for both spot- and single-cell-resolution data sets.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Application of DSCT to spatial transcriptomic data sets from different species</title><p>The variability in gene-expression complexity across different species poses a challenge, as methods that are effective in one species may not be suitable for others. To validate the applicability of the DSCT method across different species, we further tested human and mouse cortical tissues. Spatial transcriptomic data sets of human middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and mouse primary visual cortex (VIS), produced by the MERFISH platform [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], were selected, alongside previously reported corresponding single-cell transcriptomic data [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] for spatial cell typing (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4a-l</xref>). Prior to the prediction process, cortical cells were categorized into three major classes: excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and non-neuronal cells, to better illustrate the hierarchical distribution of different cell types in the cerebral cortex. The DSCT method was then used to map the spatial organization patterns of the excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and non-neuronal cells in the human and mouse cortices (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Remarkably, the DSCT mapping results were highly consistent with the previous annotation from the MERFISH data sets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). In the human and mouse data sets, DSCT accurately mapped the L2/3, L4, L5 and L6 intratelencephalic (IT) neurons, revealing a pronounced and similar stratification in both species. Distinctly, the L6b neurons presented divergent patterns: in the human MTG, these neurons were broadly dispersed across layer L6, even reaching into L5 and the adjacent white matter. Conversely, in the mouse VIS, L6b neurons constituted a more defined, narrow band at the lower boundary of layer L6. This observed divergence in L6b neuronal distribution is consistent with earlier studies and the MERFISH data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). In the prediction of excitatory neuronal types within mouse data sets, refined scRNA-seq data sets with detailed annotations were utilized, allowing the division of IT and other excitatory neurons into distinct subtypes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5a and b</xref>). The DSCT prediction results accurately located these subtypes within their specific cortical layers, demonstrating its ability to differentiate and identify more finely divided subtypes. Observations of inhibitory neuron and non-neuronal cell distributions in the human and mouse data also revealed biologically meaningful patterns. In humans, VIP neurons were mainly concentrated in the superficial layer of the cortex, while other types of inhibitory neurons exhibited more uniform distributions. Interestingly, in mice, both VIP and Lamp5 neurons were primarily distributed in the upper layer of the cortex, while other cell types exhibited more scattered distribution patterns (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5a and b</xref>). These results are consistent with previous findings [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and reflect the essential characteristics of neuronal distribution, although the biological implications of these species-specific differences in the laminar organization of cortical neurons require further investigation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>High accuracy of DSCT for cross-species analysis.

As expected, the DSCT-predicted cell types showed excellent correspondence to the previous annotated data, with an average accuracy rate of 95% for human data and 90% for mouse data. The only slight distributional discrepancy observed was for L6 CT neurons in the human cortex and VLMCs in the mouse cortex, where some cells were misidentified as L6b neurons and Astros, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). This prediction bias may be due to the scarcity of L6 corticothalamic neuron (CT) cells in the human cortical scRNA-seq data and the small number of total genes (only 242) in the mouse scRNA-seq data, which impacts training. Despite these limitations, the performance of DSCT was outstanding, ranking among the best of all methods tested (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5</xref>). Furthermore, Acc Scores were used to quantitatively evaluate the prediction results of the selected algorithms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>).

Specifically, we extracted spatial transcriptomic data of hippocampal tissue from 60 mouse brain slices, including 2 slices from the left hemisphere and 2 slices from the right hemisphere (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6a</xref>).</p><p>Using the DSCT algorithm, we performed cell typing at both the cluster and supertype levels and validated the results by examining cell types and gene-distribution patterns. Notably, hippocampal structures, including the CA1, CA2, CA3 and DG structures, were mapped with higher granularity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Our analysis successfully defined 205 cluster types and 103 supertype types in data set 36 (C57BL6J-638850.36) and 179 cluster types and 100 supertype types in data set 37 (C57BL6J-638850.36) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6a and b</xref>). The former annotated MERFISH data set identified 189 cluster types and 94 supertype types in data set 36 and 160 cluster types and 81 supertype types in data set 37, closely matching our refined classification (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6a and b</xref>, and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7a</xref>). Of note, the Cell2location algorithm, while reporting the highest number of cell types (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), incorrectly mapped several ineffective cell types from non-hippocampal regions, such as the cortex (CTX), within the hippocampus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>) and the expected distribution of cell types in the hippocampal region was not adequately captured (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6b</xref>).

Additionally, DSCT demonstrated high performance in the Acc Score metric, which provides a comprehensive evaluation of classification accuracy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref>). Notably, our model significantly improved processing efficiency without compromising classification accuracy. DSCT completed the cell-typing task in just 27.1&#x000a0;s for the cluster level and 16.3&#x000a0;s for the supertype level. In comparison, the similarly precise RCTD method required 18.9 and 2.7&#x000a0;h, respectively, to process the same data (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). This substantial enhancement in efficiency is crucial for handling large-scale transcriptomic data sets.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The computational integration of spatially resolved transcriptomic and scRNA-seq data combines the advantages of both technologies and overcomes the inherent shortcomings of spatial transcriptomics, such as low throughput and limited capture rates. However, existing methods often demand extensive computing resources and time, and their accuracy and versatility across different platforms and species remain uncertain. In this context, the proposed DSCT algorithm demonstrates excellent spatial cell-typing ability in different brain regions, platforms, species and finer cell types. This approach not only demonstrates higher accuracy and scalability compared with existing methods, but also requires fewer computing resources and time.</p><p>DSCT is a predictive method that relies on the specificity and depth of gene capture (<italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> capture technique) and the specificity and quantity of probe selection (<italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> sequencing and <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> hybridization techniques). In our analysis, we observed obvious error bars in the evaluation of spatial cell typing when using STARmap (<italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> sequencing technique) data sets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>), indicating substantial variability in the Acc Score metrics. This variability may stem from probe selections that do not effectively capture gene features, as current probes are generally designed for the entire brain rather than specific brain regions. Additionally, the <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> sequencing technique may bring considerable background noise, affecting data clarity. Therefore, it is advisable to optimize probe designs by customizing them for specific brain regions, in order to better capture spatial gene-expression characteristics and improve prediction accuracy.</p><p>Previous studies have typically used matched sc/snRNA-seq data from adjacent tissue sections to perform spatial cell typing [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data from non-identical tissue can also be effectively integrated (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), validating the robustness of the DSCT method. Nevertheless, using sc/snRNA-seq data from adjacent tissue sections enhanced spatial cell-typing accuracy. In situations in which scRNA data included cells from the subiculum, but the spatial data sets of Slide-seq and STARmap lacked this structural representation, inaccuracies arose in spatial mapping, leading to the incorrect identification of some cells as subiculum cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4a and d</xref>). Consequently, employing sc/snRNA-seq data from tissue sections that are adjacent to those under study for spatial cell-type annotation by DSCT tended to yield more accurate results.</p><p>Although this study primarily focused on the application of DSCT to brain tissue, the underlying theoretical framework also makes it well suited for use in other complex biological tissues, such as tumors. DSCT has the capability to identify spatially resolved heterogeneous cell populations within tumor microenvironments, offering valuable insights into the cellular architecture of tumors. We analysed the human breast cancer data set and successfully reproduced the distinct distribution patterns of two ductal tumors, as well as the expected distribution of diverse cell types within the same tumor tissue (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8a</xref>). These findings are consistent with well-established biological characteristics of tumors [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, our algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy when compared with the original spatial transcriptomic annotations (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8b</xref>). To further validate the accuracy of our classification, we compared the gene-expression profiles of key marker genes (<italic toggle="yes">FGL2, POSTN, BANK1, TCIM, FASN, IL7R, KRT6B</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CEACAM6</italic>) with our classifications, with the expression patterns showing strong concordance (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8c</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">d</xref>). We also explored the biological functions of CD8+T cells and invasive tumor cells based on the classification results that were generated by DSCT (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8e</xref>). Results revealed a strong correlation between the classified cell types and their known cellular functions. Specifically, CD8+T cells exhibited notable activity in immune surveillance and tumor suppression, while invasive tumor cells displayed enhanced cell proliferation and migration, associated with elevated expression of invasive markers and extracellular matrix interacting molecules. This detailed characterization of cellular functions not only provides deeper insights into the cell&#x02013;cell interactions and communication networks within a tumor microenvironment, but also offers potential pathways for identifying novel therapeutic targets. In addition, the applicability of DSCT extends beyond transcriptomics. It can be adapted for use in other omics fields, such as proteomics and epigenomics, providing a more comprehensive understanding of biological processes at the subcellular level. This flexibility positions DSCT as a versatile tool for studying a wide range of biological systems.</p><p>When discussing the potential limitations of the DSCT method, we should focus on two core issues. Firstly, due to technical differences and inconsistent sequencing depths between different spatial transcriptome platforms (such as Stereo-seq, STARmap, Slide-seq), data noise may affect the accurate interpretation of spatial gene information by mapping algorithms. Secondly, the effectiveness of the DSCT algorithm is highly dependent on the accuracy of single-cell annotation and inaccurate annotations may have a negative impact on the final results. To overcome these limitations, we plan to utilize spatial continuity and intercellular relationships in future research to reduce data noise and explore the development of more accurate and targeted automatic single-cell transcriptome annotation algorithms that are currently lacking. Although DSCT has room for improvement in certain areas, it demonstrates outstanding performance in cell-type annotation across species, platforms, various brain regions and fine-grained cell types. It outperforms other methods by achieving high accuracy with low computational resource demands and fast processing speeds. This method provides an efficient, reliable tool and a new perspective for spatial transcriptomic research, which is anticipated to further propel advancements and innovation in the field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec4"><title>METHODS</title><p>In this study, we systematically collected published spatial transcriptomic data sets from various platforms, encompassing multiple brain regions. In detail, cerebellar and OB data sets were obtained from the Stereo-seq platform, while hippocampal data sets were sourced from the Stereo-seq, 10x Visium, 10x Xenium, STARmap and Slide-seq platforms. For cortical data, human MTG and mouse primary visual cortex data sets were obtained from the MERFISH platform. All these data sets are publicly available, as shown in the &#x02018;Data availability&#x02019; section. Notably, the spatial transcriptomic annotations that were derived from the MERFISH platform were used as the previous annotated reference for validating and comparing our results. Concurrently, previously published sc/snRNA-seq data that were relevant to these brain regions were collated and annotated to facilitate subsequent cell typing.
