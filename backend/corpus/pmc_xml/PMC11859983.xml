Participants included were psychiatric nurses working in Razi Hospital, Tunisia. We collected data using pre-established questionnaire which included socio-demographic and clinical data of the participants. The assessment of Burnout was conducted using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), validated in Arabic.&#x000a0;Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) in its 25th version.</p></sec><sec id="sec3387"><title>Results</title><p>We collected data from 55 nurses working in Razi psychiatry hospital during the time of the study. Among them, 80% (n=44) were female. Their median age was 35 (Min=25, Max=62). Most of participants were married (81.8%, n=45) and 70.9 (n=39) had kids. In our sample, 5.5% (n=3) and 23.6% (n=13) had respectively personal psychiatric and somatic history. Some addictive behaviors were identified among our participants, especially smoking (14.5%, n=379) and alcohol use (3.6%, n=2).</p><p>Regarding working conditions, 81.8% (n=45) were assigned shift work. They worked in the men&#x02019;s ward (43.6%, n=24), the women&#x02019;s ward (34.5%, n=19), or in both (21.8%, n=12). Furthermore, 45.5% (n=25) reported witnessing a suicide attempt during their work, and 74.5% (n=41) were victims of aggression, primarily by patients (82.5%, n=33). Sixty percent (n=33) said expressed a desire to transfer.</p><p>According to the MBI, 49.1% (n=27) had high emotional exhaustion, 27.3% (n=15) had high depersonalization and 67.3% (n=37) had low personal accomplishment.</p><p>A significant association was found between low personal accomplishment and the desire to transfer to another department (p=0.026). No further links were found with other clinical data.</p></sec><sec id="sec3388"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings provide a thorough examination of burnout among psychiatric nursing professionals, underscoring the critical need for specific interventions tailored to their unique challenges.</p></sec><sec id="sec3389"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
