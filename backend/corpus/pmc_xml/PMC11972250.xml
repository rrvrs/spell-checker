Tumour volume was measured by contouring the angiomyolipoma on CT scans. The partial volume of the angiomyogenic component (blood vessels and smooth muscle relative to fatty tissue) was derived using attenuation threshold values measured in Hounsfield Units.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Bleeding angiomyolipoma exhibited a significantly higher proportion of angiomyogenic component (23%) than non-bleeding angiomyolipoma (8%) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.042). Angiomyolipoma with 0&#x02013;5% angiomyogenic component had a lower risk of bleeding compared to those with &#x02265;&#x02009;5% angiomyogenic component (13% vs 42%). Mean attenuation values of angiomyogenic components did not differ between bleeders and non-bleeders. Aneurysms were observed in 24% of angiomyolipoma during angiography. No statistically significant association was found between the occurrence of aneurysms and bleeding, neither when all aneurysms were included nor when only aneurysms&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;5&#x02009;mm were considered. Tuberous sclerosis patients had larger tumours (11.4&#x02009;cm vs 6.0&#x02009;cm), but no significant difference in bleeding was observed (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.53).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">A higher proportion of the angiomyogenic component in bleeding renal angiomyolipoma suggests a possible association with bleeding. Angiomyolipoma with less than 5% angiomyogenic components may represent a subgroup with a reduced risk of bleeding.

Renal neoplasms are the most common aetiology, with angiomyolipoma predominating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. While most angiomyolipoma exhibit an indolent behaviour, our current understanding lacks precise markers to identify those at risk of spontaneous bleeding. The traditional four-centimetre size cut-off for prophylactic intervention is increasingly under scrutiny, and other indicators of bleeding risk are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Angiomyolipoma are composed of blood vessels (angio), smooth muscle (myo) and fat (lipoma) in varying proportions. Computed tomography (CT) allows for the differentiation and quantitative assessment of fatty vs angiomyogenic components through three-dimensional (3D) modelling. Despite this, few studies have delved into tumour composition as a risk factor for bleeding, and no study has previously investigated whether differences in contrast attenuation of the angiomyogenic component influence bleeding risk.</p><p id="Par19">Vessels in angiomyolipoma are eccentric and thick-walled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Angiographies often reveal irregular, tortuous vessels with microaneurysms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Notably, both the presence and size of aneurysms have been proposed as potential predictors of rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These findings have since been widely referred to. However, existing studies on this subject typically only include a small number of bleeding cases.</p><p id="Par20">Renal angiomyolipoma come in two types: the sporadic form and those linked to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Sporadic ones are usually single, symptom-free, and more common in females. Conversely, TSC-associated ones often appear as multiple, bilateral tumours without a gender difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, scientific evidence regarding their correlation with bleeding remains limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The aim of this study is to examine radiological characteristics, including tumour tissue composition, contrast attenuation, and aneurysm presence, in patients with and without bleeding prior to embolisation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par22">This study retrospectively analysed 58 angiomyolipoma from 53 patients treated with first-time selective arterial embolisation between 1999 and 2018 at Sahlgrenska University Hospital and NU Hospital Group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

To the best of our knowledge, this study includes the largest cohort of patients with comprehensive radiological mapping of angiomyolipoma, some of whom experienced a bleeding event prior to selective arterial embolisation. We demonstrate that bleeding angiomyolipoma exhibits a significantly higher median proportion of angiomyogenic components (23% vs 8%), comprising vessels and smooth muscle. However, contrary to previous beliefs, aneurysm occurrence does not seem to be strongly associated with an increased risk of bleeding.</p><p id="Par44">Albeit being the most common aetiology of spontaneous renal haemorrhage into the retroperitoneal space, most angiomyolipoma are indolent. Two reviews exploring the current understanding of spontaneous renal haemorrhage documented 165 cases between 1985 and 1999 and 102 cases between 2000 and 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Of these, 29% and 42%, respectively, were found to be caused by angiomyolipoma. Size has commonly been considered a major risk factor for bleeding, but its significance is increasingly questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Studies investigating other risk factors, such as the proportions of fat and angiomyogenic components, are scant. In 2005, Rimon investigated a three-tiered grading system for vascularity, primarily based on angiographies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The study suggested an elevated risk of bleeding in angiomyolipoma with heightened vascularity, although statistical significance was not achieved. Subsequent reports include Combs&#x02019;s recent findings, demonstrating a &#x0003e;&#x02009;50% angiomyogenic component in all five ruptured angiomyolipomas within their series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Studies on the impact of absolute volumes of angiomyogenic components are hitherto lacking.</p><p id="Par45">The probability of bleeding was low among angiomyolipoma with smaller proportions (&#x0003c;&#x02009;5%) and absolute volumes (&#x0003c;&#x02009;10&#x02009;cm<sup>3)</sup> of angiomyogenic components. This finding may, if reproduced, have clinical implications as a large proportion of angiomyolipoma probably exhibit this composition (fat-rich). In this selected cohort, one-third of all angiomyolipoma had a proportion of angiomyogenic components of less than 5%. It may be assumed that this share is even larger in an unselected population of patients with angiomyolipoma. It could then be of clinical interest to state the angiomyogenic proportion in the radiology report, as it may aid in treatment decisions. However, these concepts require further studies before any recommendations can be made.</p><p id="Par46">Small renal masses are frequent incidental findings on imaging. Some of these represent asymptomatic angiomyolipoma that require active surveillance or prophylactic embolisation. Defining a low-risk group for bleeding events is thus clinically relevant in terms of avoiding overtreatment. However, differentiating tumours with 0&#x02013;5% angiomyogenic component from those with &#x02265;&#x02009;5% requires precise identification on CT scans. Manual tumour contouring is labour-intensive but crucial for detecting subtle differences in tumour content. Its clinical utility may therefore be limited, though AI-driven tools for contouring hold promise for future clinical applications.</p><p id="Par47">We hypothesised that the degree of attenuation within the angiomyogenic component, as a measure of contrast enhancement, would be important for bleeding risk. However, no such association was confirmed. To our knowledge, this has not been studied previously.</p><p id="Par48">Aneurysm formation, especially larger aneurysms, is proposed to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Yamakado established this idea based on eight bleeding angiomyolipoma, all of which had aneurysms&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;5&#x02009;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, 14 of 21 non-bleeding angiomyolipoma revealed aneurysm formation, including four&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;5&#x02009;mm in size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Champagnac demonstrated aneurysms in four of five haemorrhagic angiomyolipoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The mean diameter of the largest aneurysm was 9.5&#x02009;mm compared to 3.9&#x02009;mm in 17 unruptured angiomyolipoma. McQueen reported aneurysms in four of five bleeding angiomyolipoma, in contrast to 6 of 22 tumours without bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. They found no significant difference in mean aneurysm size between the groups. Bardin reported a significant difference in the presence of aneurysms in a series of six bleeding and 17 non-bleeding angiomyolipoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In contrast, Rimon identified merely five aneurysms among 13 cases of bleeding angiomyolipoma, with only three surpassing the 5&#x02009;mm threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our finding of aneurysms in 24% is in the lower range compared with previous reports: 13%, 35%, 39%, 40%, and 76% of tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We found no significant difference regarding aneurysm occurrence in 21 bleeding and 33 non-bleeding tumours. Furthermore, we found no significant difference in bleeding between aneurysms measuring&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5 and &#x02265;&#x02009;5&#x02009;mm.</p><p id="Par49">Consequently, aneurysm formation may not be such a decisive factor for bleeding events as previously thought. Another concern is that reliable aneurysm mapping requires invasive angiographies, as illustrated by our finding that only 50% of aneurysms were identified on CT scans. However, this detection rate might have been higher if all scans had been performed using a specific angiographic protocol. Only one study has explored aneurysms diagnosed via CT angiography, without confirmation through traditional angiographies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This study, involving six bleeding and 28 non-bleeding angiomyolipoma, found no significant correlation between aneurysm size measured on CT and rupture. Future studies should ideally focus on aneurysms in angiomyolipoma identified by CT angiography, rather than traditional invasive methods.</p><p id="Par50">It is hypothesised that individuals with TSC are more prone to vascular irregularities due to uncontrolled activation of mTOR and its effects on angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Aneurysm formation differed and was more common, larger, and often multiple in TSC patients. Whether this higher rate is due to TSC itself or reflects the fact that TSC-associated tumours were larger and had significantly greater partial volumes of angiomyogenic components remains unknown. Only two studies have compared TSC-associated angiomyolipoma to sporadic ones regarding angiomyogenic content and aneurysms. Rimon classified most TSC-associated angiomyolipoma as having heightened vascular complexity (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7), while Champagnac observed decreased fat content (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;36) without significant differences in aneurysm incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">This study has several limitations.
