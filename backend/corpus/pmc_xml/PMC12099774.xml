As such, VEXAS patients may be initially diagnosed with relapsing polychondritis, myelodysplastic syndrome, and other syndromes.</p><p id="p0015">Here, we report the first Chinese VEXAS patient carrying a hemizygous NM_003334.4:c.121A&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;G (p.M41V) <italic>UBA1</italic> mutation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A), detected by a whole-exome sequencing analysis at a variant allele frequency of 69.6%, one of the three major <italic>UBA1</italic> mutations occurring in VEXAS syndrome. The patient was a 50-year-old man who initially presented with long-lasting recurrent fever, auricular chondritis, and maculopapular rash, without neurological manifestations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B, C). The patient was hospitalized three times from Nov 25, 2022, to Apr 30, 2024, in our hospital. Essentially, the patient's red blood cell counts, hemoglobin levels, and platelet levels were consistently far below normal ranges, dropping down rapidly, especially upon a new infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>D&#x02013;G and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). The positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan revealed diffuse elevation of bone marrow glucose metabolism throughout the body (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</xref>), reminiscent of bone marrow activation. Inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, were consistently increased (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). Moreover, serum cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3;, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-17 were substantially elevated (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>). The patient had aberrant immune responses and recurrent infections, as neutrophil ratios were mostly increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>H&#x02013;K). However, lymphocyte ratios, assessed by TBNK assays, as well as natural killer cell activities were all normal (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>). Immunoglobin (IgA, IgG, IgM), autoimmune antibodies (antinuclear antibodies and antiplatelet antibodies), and complements (C3, C4) were also normal.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Molecular and pathological manifestations of this VEXAS case. <bold>(A)</bold> Sanger sequencing of the peripheral blood sample showed a mosaic mutation of <italic>UBA1</italic> gene (c.121A&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;G; p.M41V). <bold>(B, C)</bold> The patient was a 50-year-old man who initially presented with lasting fever, auricular chondritis, and maculopapular rash on the trunk and extremities. <bold>(D</bold>&#x02013;<bold>K)</bold> The patient was hospitalized three times from Nov 25, 2022, to Apr 30, 2024, in our hospital.

Moreover, both flow cytometry analysis of bone marrow lymphocytes and chromosomal karyotype analysis did not show any obvious abnormalities, which suggests no evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome. Interestingly, serum ferritin and sCD25 (soluble cluster of differentiation 25)/IL-2R levels were consistently elevated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>L and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S4</xref>). Taken together, the patient's symptoms met at least five out of the eight hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)-2004 diagnostic criteria, including long-lasting fever, cytopenia (decreased in the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages), hemophagocytosis, hyperferritinemia, and elevated sCD25/IL-2R (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S4</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">Chest computed tomography scans showed an intermittent course of new infection and absorption. Typically, computed tomography images manifested multiple flaky, ground-glass opacities and pulmonary consolidations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>O). Next-generation sequencing tests of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid identified a variety of pathogens such as <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic>, <italic>Rickettsia</italic>, <italic>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic>, and <italic>Malassezia furfur</italic> (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S4</xref>). Tuberculosis, however, was not detected by IFN-&#x003b3; release assays (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S5</xref>). In addition, <italic>cytomegalovirus</italic> and <italic>Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus</italic> were inactivated, albeit with moderately increased loads (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S6</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">Although the patient had been continuously treated with anti-bacterial and anti-fungal drugs, the inflammatory symptoms (such as fever and cytokine storm) were remarkably ameliorated only with prednisone, ruxolitinib, or tocilizumab treatment, since Aug. 2023. Specifically, ruxolitinib treatment improved the inflammation state and decreased the frequency of fever. Five days after ruxolitinib treatment (08/21/2023), serum cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2, IL-5, IL-8, IL-12p70, and IL-17 were remarkably reduced (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>). However, the patient still suffered recurred fever occasionally before Nov. 2023 when VEXAS syndrome was diagnosed, and methylprednisone (40&#x000a0;mg/d) was given.</p><p id="p0035">Notably, ruxolitinib was discontinued (since Feb. 2024) due to worsened anemia. After that, tocilizumab (480 mg/3&#x02013;4 weeks) and low-dose prednisone (10&#x000a0;mg/d and tapering to 7.5&#x000a0;mg/d) were regularly given. After treatment with tocilizumab for 14 days (03/14/2024), tests of serum cytokines showed that IL-6 and IFN-&#x003b3; level was 298.25&#x000a0;pg/mL and 130.82&#x000a0;pg/mL, respectively, while levels of other cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b1;, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-12p70, and IL-17 were all decreased back to normal ranges (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">The patient was then followed up for 8 months until Dec. 2024, during which there were no instances of fever. Before injection of tocilizumab every 3&#x02013;4 weeks, the patient may experience mild muscle aches/pains or a few new rashes, along with elevated levels of C-reactive protein (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). However, all these symptoms could be alleviated after the administration of tocilizumab. Basically, the hemoglobin level was maintained at around 70.0&#x02013;80.0&#x000a0;g/L, and the platelet level was maintained at around 60.0&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>/L (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). The coagulation examination was relatively normal (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S7</xref>). As such, the patient was in a stable condition that greatly improved his life quality. A comprehensive medical history, including detailed pathological manifestations and treatments, is described in the supplementary file and is briefly summarized in a chronicle in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>.</p><p id="p0045">Not surprisingly, VEXAS syndrome presents a significant predisposition to infections, a consequence of acquired immunodeficiency stemming from a compromised ubiquitin-proteasome system as well as immunosuppressive therapies.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>&#x000a0;Within a French VEXAS registry,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>&#x000a0;infections were prevalent.

Here, we propose that the hyperimmune milieu, caused by <italic>UBA1</italic> mutations, presents an intrinsic risk for HLH, while susceptibility to infections acts as a second hit. This hypothesis aligns with our current understanding of HLH, which often involves a combination of genetic predisposition and triggering factors like infections or malignancies. To support this, first, we identified no HLH or myeloid-associated genetic variants in this patient after whole-exome sequencing detection, excluding the possibility of familial HLH (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S8</xref>). Second, in this study, the patient's cytopenia worsened rapidly upon each new infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>G), suggesting that infections are highly possible to give a second hit to developing HLH in VEXAS patients. However, due to the rarity of VEXAS, further studies are crucial to validate this.</p><p id="p0055">To date, there are only two documented cases of VEXAS syndrome in China with distinct <italic>UBA1</italic> mutations (p.M41T and p.M41L).<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>&#x000a0;This study presents the first Chinese VEXAS patient carrying a p.M41V mutation, which is linked with a more severe phenotype due to lower residual translation of the normal cytoplasmic UBA1 isoform UBA1b.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>&#x000a0;Given the recurrent infections and HLH symptoms in this patient, it is imperative to closely monitor disease progression and potential drug resistance.
