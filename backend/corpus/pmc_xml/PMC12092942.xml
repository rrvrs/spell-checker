The latter might result from relapse-associated worsening (RAW) or &#x02013; more frequently &#x02013; from progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA).<sup><xref rid="bibr1-13524585251327300" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-13524585251327300" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Clinical history and neurological examination remain the gold standard for quantifying and tracking disability over time. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is the clinical reference measure for assessing clinical changes and is used to define confirmed worsening or confirmed progression for both, RAW and PIRA. Furthermore, the EDSS serves as the main clinical reference to be compared with other measures, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluid biomarkers<sup><xref rid="bibr3-13524585251327300" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-13524585251327300" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and patient-reported outcomes,<sup>

</sup></p><p>However, an EDSS score &#x02a7e;4.5 reflects almost exclusively the ambulation capacity, while the deficits captured by other Functional Systems (FS) and their respective subscores tend to be eclipsed. This loss of information has important implications for documenting relevant disease worsening and understanding disease phenotypes of people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Such neglect of deficits in domains other than ambulation is also an obstacle to patient-tailored disease management.</p><p>The Neurostatus-EDSS is the main measure in phase 2 and 3 trials for new disease-modifying treatments in MS.<sup>

Accordingly, the HDBSCAN algorithm emerges as a suitable clustering algorithm that aims at delineating clusters in low-dimensionality data.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr17-13524585251327300" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</sup> The HDBSCAN algorithm is designed to identify clusters in a data set based on the density of data points.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr18-13524585251327300" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, it explicitly identifies noise points in the data that do not belong to any cluster. This is beneficial for handling noisy data.</p><p>The relative validity score, a simplification of the Density-Based Cluster Validity (DBCV) score, is applied to compare the results during the tuning of hyperparameters.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr19-13524585251327300" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</sup> The score is calculated with all the combinations of UMAP and HDBSCAN hyperparameters, and the hyperparameter with the higher score is used to calculate the results. Consequently, the results of the clustering algorithm consolidate data exhibiting comparable features.</p></sec><sec id="section15-13524585251327300"><title>Defining new patterns within existing EDSS scores</title><p>For each cluster, we calculated the percentage of assessments with high impairment in activities of daily living (ADLs) for each selected feature (=subscore after binarization).

<xref rid="bibr21-13524585251327300" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</sup> Other than imaging and fluid biomarkers, the EDSS as a clinical descriptor of disability accumulation represents the closest approximation to the subjective burden of disease. This increases its relevance as a pivotal endpoint measure during a drug approval process. The dominant position of the EDSS is further underpinned by being part of composite outcomes, such as No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA) and No Evidence of Progression or Active Disease (NEPAD), as well as PIRA and RAW that are used to describe the individual disease status<sup><xref rid="bibr22-13524585251327300" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-13524585251327300" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and to discern the different drivers of disease progression in pwMS.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr24-13524585251327300" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</sup></p><p>However, a weak point of the EDSS is its dependency on ambulation and its relatively low sensitivity to changes in domains other than ambulation, particularly in more severely affected patients.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr25-13524585251327300" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</sup> Consequently, at EDSS &#x02a7e;4.5, the contribution of other clinically relevant symptoms is overshadowed and not reflected by the overall EDSS score alone. An immediate consequence of this is a reduced ability to capture the heterogeneity of the disease and relative inertia to longitudinal change at these EDSS levels, factors of high relevance for the selection of participants and detection of drug effect in clinical trials.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr25-13524585251327300" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</sup></p><p>Our study aimed to address these limitations, taking advantage of the large, high-quality data set of the EXPAND study. Using the Neurostatus-eEDSS, this data set contained not only the EDSS and FSS information but also quantified, standardized and rigorously quality-controlled assessments of the full neurological examination, which remarkably includes 100 mandatory subtests per assessment, the so-called subscores.</p><p>We applied MLA on those subscores and identified clusters which led to distinct disability patterns within EDSS scores ranging from 4.0 to 6.5. These patterns allow describing with more granularity the range of functional impairment beyond ambulation in pwMS. In our data set, higher EDSS scores include a higher proportion of assessments falling into pattern A. This might indicate that these patterns may also be useful for a more granular quantification of the severity of deficits or further prognosis, but further studies are necessary to explore this option. Such increased granularity may increase the power of clinical trials to detect treatment effects on deficits that are relevant to patients and their ADL but are not reflected by quantifying ambulation only. A more comprehensive description of the burden of disease may help to better select pwMS who may benefit from more specific treatments, both symptomatic and targeted according to underlying pathogenic processes. Further studies in other data sets, including patients at different disease stages, are needed to establish the utility of the patterns derived in this study. If further studies confirm that this increase in granularity comes along with improved correlations to other measures and higher predictive score, these patterns could potentially be integrated into a more granular, ordinally arranged measure, which, while not necessarily equidistant, may serve as an &#x02018;expanded&#x02019; version of the EDSS. Such integration of disease patterns would also have implications for improved power of analysis and reduced sample sizes in future clinical trials.</p><p>In conclusion, the patterns obtained through our analysis set the stage for further development of the well-established Neurostatus-EDSS and Neurostatus-eEDSS. These advancements aim to provide a more comprehensive assessment of disability, offering greater sensitivity to change and addressing a key limitation of the EDSS, particularly in the severity range between 4.0 and 6.5.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="section24-13524585251327300" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material id="suppl1-13524585251327300" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>sj-docx-1-msj-10.1177_13524585251327300 &#x02013; Supplemental material for AI-assisted identification of disability patterns within identical EDSS grades</title></caption><media xlink:href="sj-docx-1-msj-10.1177_13524585251327300.docx"/><p>Supplemental material, sj-docx-1-msj-10.1177_13524585251327300 for AI-assisted identification of disability patterns within identical EDSS grades by Martina Greselin, Po-Jui Lu, Magdalena Mroczek, Nuria Cerd&#x000e1;-Fuertes, Anastasios Demirtzoglou, Athina Papadopoulou, Jens Kuhle, David Leppert, Sophie Arnould, Manar Aoun, Ludwig Kappos, Cristina Granziera and Marcus D&#x02019;Souza in Multiple Sclerosis Journal</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Professor George K.
