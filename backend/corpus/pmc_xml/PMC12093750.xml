This study performed a comprehensive Material Flow Analysis (MFA) of medications in a large academic ICU to quantify material flows and identify opportunities for sustainability.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A single-center MFA was conducted at a 50-bed ICU, analyzing all medications delivered in 2023. Medication and packaging components were weighed and categorized by active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), excipients, and packaging type. Total annual mass as well as daily medication and packaging waste per patient were calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The annual medication inflow totaled 234,337&#x000a0;kg, including 194,411&#x000a0;kg of medication content (5287&#x000a0;kg APIs, 189,124&#x000a0;kg excipients) and 39,923&#x000a0;kg of packaging. APIs constituted only 2.3% of the total medication mass. On average, patients received 89.5 medication units daily, totaling 5.0&#x000a0;kg of medication and generating 1.7&#x000a0;kg of packaging waste. Waste outflow comprised 194,413&#x000a0;kg to the sewage system, 21,894&#x000a0;kg for incineration, and 18,030&#x000a0;kg recycled, consisting primarily of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) bags.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This MFA highlights significant opportunities to enhance ICU medication sustainability by targeting CRRT-related waste, optimizing fluid formulations to reduce excipient use, and minimizing packaging.

Given this environmental burden, there is an urgent need to transform ICUs into more environmentally friendly healthcare systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Gaetani et al. showed that carbon emissions of ICUs range between 88 and 178&#x000a0;kg of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent per patient per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Hunfeld et al. performed a material flow analysis (MFA) that showed per-patient contributions of up to 17&#x000a0;kg of waste, 12&#x000a0;kg CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions and 300&#x000a0;L of water consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This substantial impact highlights the necessity of targeted interventions in critical care settings.</p><p id="Par7">Medication represents a significant share of healthcare's carbon footprint. In the Netherlands, pharmaceuticals and chemical products account for 41.2% of the healthcare sector's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At Erasmus MC University Medical Center, medication was responsible for 52.1 kilotons of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent in 2021, representing 41.6% of scope 3 emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Scope 3 covers all indirect greenhouse gas emissions resulting from an organization's upstream and downstream activities (like producing purchased goods or treating waste) that fall outside its direct operational control (scope 1) or its purchased energy consumption (scope 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Notably, while comprising only 5% of hospital beds, our ICU receives 18% of total hospital medication deliveries (based on analysis of internal pharmacy distribution records of 2023), highlighting the high medication intensity of the ICU.</p><p id="Par8">Despite the widely recognized environmental burden of ICUs and medications, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the specific contribution of medications used in critical care. A deeper understanding of the current environmental footprint of the medication lifecycle, including the number of medications used, their packaging, and the composition of their active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), is essential. These data are critical to identify circular strategies. For this, the 10R-framework (see Supplementary Information 1) can be used; for instance, the recycling of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) bags [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], or the reduction of packaging materials for medication.</p><p id="Par9">The MFA of Hunfeld et al. evaluated the environmental impact of medical products used in the ICU, demonstrating the method&#x02019;s utility for assessing resource use and waste generation in healthcare settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, that analysis did not specifically account for medications. To date, no studies have comprehensively assessed the environmental impact of ICU medications. Parvatker et al. investigated the cradle-to-gate GHG emissions for twenty anesthetic medications. However, this does not provide a complete overview of ICU medications and is not based on circular strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the calculation of the total greenhouse gas emissions of all ICU medications requires complex life cycle assessments (LCAs) from cradle-to-grave, whilst the data needed to perform these LCAs are not publicly available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">The primary aim of this study is to quantify and characterize the material flows of medication in an academic ICU for adult patients for the year 2023. Secondary objectives include determining the ratios of active ingredients to excipients, as well as the weights of leaflets, primary packaging, and secondary packaging. These findings will help to develop circular strategies to reduce the ecological footprint of ICU medications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and scope</title><p id="Par11">We conducted a single-center MFA (see Supplementary Information 2) of medications used in the ICU at Erasmus MC University Medical Center in 2023.

This disproportionate ratio underscores the importance of considering the API-excipient-packaging ratio in procurement procedures. This finding highlights that procurement decisions based solely on API may overlook significant material burdens associated with excipients and packaging. On average, ICU patients receive 89.5 medications daily, totaling 5.0&#x000a0;kg of medication and generating 1.7&#x000a0;kg of associated packaging waste. Of the 234,337&#x000a0;kg of medication delivered annually, 194,413&#x000a0;kg was discharged into the sewage system, 21,894&#x000a0;kg was incinerated, and 18,030&#x000a0;kg was recycled (primarily CRRT-related packaging). Quantifying the material flow in a 50-bed ICU provides a basis for reassessing existing medication protocols and developing targeted waste reduction strategies, ultimately enabling environmental sustainability in critical care.</p><p id="Par43">This study highlights several key areas for intervention. First, the substantial contribution of CRRT to the overall material flow (74.1% of total inflow) necessitates targeted strategies to reduce waste in this area. This could include exploring alternative CRRT modalities that minimize fluid and material use or optimizing current protocols to reduce waste. Second, the low API mass percentage in fluid formulations, particularly in syringes (1.3%) and ampoules (5.8%), suggests potential for developing more concentrated formulations. This could significantly reduce waste, especially given the increasing reliability and widespread use of infusion pumps in ICUs. Third, the significant mass associated with fluid formulations also highlights the potential impact of clinical practice choices, such as favoring oral administration when appropriate, as promoted by initiatives like the &#x0201c;paracetamol challenge&#x0201d; (encouraging oral administration when clinically appropriate) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Fourth, the annual disposal of 1187&#x000a0;kg of package inserts presents an opportunity for improvement, as this information is readily available online. The 2024 pilot program for electronic product information (ePI) in the Netherlands, part of a broader EU initiative, is a promising development that will eliminate the need for many paper package inserts, including those for the medications analyzed in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">This MFA quantified the outflow pathways, indicating that 194,413&#x000a0;kg of the medication mass (primarily water and excipients from fluid formulations) is released into the sewage system annually. While a detailed analysis of the environmental fate of these substances is beyond the scope of this study, the presence of pharmaceuticals in wastewater is a recognized environmental concern, potentially contributing to water source contamination, aquatic ecosystem disruption, and antimicrobial resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, it is important to contextualize this outflow figure within Dutch wastewater management practices. Regional Water Authorities employ advanced treatment processes for municipal and hospital effluent, which remove the vast majority of APIs (filtering out 92.3%), although complete elimination remains a challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Another Dutch academic hospital contributed only 3.5% to the pharmaceutical wastewater load in the region, with two-thirds of that removed by treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Understanding the precise environmental impact of the medication outflow from our ICU is a topic for future research.</p><p id="Par45">Besides the sewage outflow, the MFA clearly quantified waste streams amenable to immediate circularity interventions. Our ICU's practice of recycling CRRT-related packaging materials in 2023 demonstrates that a targeted intervention can significantly reduce the amount of incinerated waste, in this case cutting the total packaging mass sent for incineration by 45.2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The analysis further identified other substantial packaging components currently incinerated, such as the 7697.5&#x000a0;kg of annual waste from glass vial packaging (35.2% of total incinerated packaging waste), representing another major material stream where future recycling efforts could be of substantial impact.</p><p id="Par46">Despite its comprehensive scope, this study has several limitations. First, although MFA is a valid proxy for environmental harm when high-quality LCA data are unavailable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], it is less precise. LCAs, especially when conducted in adherence to ISO norms 14,040 and 14,044, provide the most precise method for assessing environmental impact. However, cradle-to-gate data for all 1,800 medications used in the ICU are unavailable, and conducting separate LCAs for each medication would require immense time and resources. An alternative approach, such as spend-based LCA (based on financial pricing), was also considered but deemed unreliable due to the weak correlation between pharmaceutical pricing and production costs.</p><p id="Par47">Second, as a single-center study conducted in the Erasmus MC University Medical Center ICU, the generalizability of our findings may be limited. However, as one of the largest ICUs in the Netherlands, it is likely representative of other academic ICUs in similar healthcare settings.</p><p id="Par48">Third, the exclusion of tertiary packaging (primarily cardboard, which is routinely recycled) may slightly underestimate total upstream waste, but its impact on the overall findings is likely minimal.</p><p id="Par49">Fourth, medication delivery data to the ICU, rather than administration data, were used in this analysis. This methodological choice was necessitated by the lack of patient-specific administration records for CRRT and infusion bags, making delivery data the most reliable source of information. Consequently, the transfer of medications between ICU and general wards upon patient admission and discharge were not considered and fall outside the scope of this study.</p><p id="Par50">Finally, this MFA focused specifically on material flows and did not quantify the energy or water consumption. It is important to acknowledge that the relative environmental impact of energy consumption versus medication use is highly context-specific, influenced by factors such as building infrastructure, energy efficiency initiatives, and the carbon intensity of the local energy grid.</p><p id="Par51">This study's strengths include its comprehensive analysis of medication material inflows and outflows. By employing a detailed MFA that included weighing 94.1% of total medication deliveries, we provide a nuanced examination of medication use in the ICU setting. Most notably, this study is the first to quantify the proportion of APIs (2.3%) relative to excipients and packaging in ICU medications, providing a crucial insight for future sustainability initiatives.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Recommendations</title><p id="Par52">The study highlights the value of MFA in assessing the environmental impact of medications. The linear lifecycle of most ICU medications, characterized by resource-intensive production, single-use packaging, and disposal of packaging through incineration, hinders circularity. To promote circularity, sustainable interventions are needed.

Of 234,337&#x000a0;kg of medication delivered in one year to the ICU, 194,413&#x000a0;kg ends up in the sewage system, 21,894&#x000a0;kg gets incinerated, and 18,030&#x000a0;kg is recycled. CRRT accounts for 74.1% of the total inflow, highlighting its disproportionate contribution to material flow. APIs constitute only 2.3% of total medication mass, with fluid formulations, particularly syringes (1.3% API) and ampoules (5.8% API), exhibiting the lowest API content, underscoring the dominance of excipients. Packaging materials, including 1187&#x000a0;kg of annual package inserts, represent a significant waste burden, with only CRRT-related packaging (18,030&#x000a0;kg) being recycled. These results establish a baseline for sustainability interventions in critical care. Thus, our data highlight key areas for sustainable interventions, including CRRT bags, fluid formulations, and the reduction of packaging waste. Future efforts should prioritize innovations in packaging design, implementing reduce and reuse strategies for systems, and reducing the ecological footprint of critical care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
