Although a subpopulation of malignant cells enhances neuronal connectivity, their impact on the immune system remains unclear. Here, we show that glioblastoma regions with enhanced neuronal connectivity exhibit regional immunosuppression, characterized by distinct immune cell compositions and the enrichment of anti-inflammatory tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). In preclinical models, knockout of Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1/<italic>Thbs1</italic>) in glioblastoma cells suppresses synaptogenesis and glutamatergic neuronal hyperexcitability. Furthermore, TSP1 knockout restores antigen presentation-related genes, promotes the infiltration of pro-inflammatory TAMs and CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T-cells in the tumor, and alleviates TAM-mediated T-cell suppression. Pharmacological inhibition of glutamatergic signaling also shifts TAMs toward a less immunosuppressive state, prolongs survival in mice, and shows the potential to enhance the efficacy of immune cell-based therapy. These findings confirm that glioma-neuronal circuit remodeling is strongly linked with regional immunosuppression and suggest that targeting glioma-neuron-immune crosstalk could provide avenues for immunotherapy.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Immunotherapy has yet to demonstrate efficacy for patients with glioblastoma.

Recent advancements have shed light on a previously unrecognized mechanism whereby neuronal activity drives glioblastoma growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> through direct synaptic connections between neurons and glioblastoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, as well as paracrine growth factors from glioblastoma cells and excitatory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Conversely, glioblastoma cells induce neuronal hyperexcitability and neuronal circuit hypersynchrony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The amount of functional connectivity between glioblastoma cells and the normal brain circuits negatively impacts patient survival through the tumor-derived synaptogenic factor thrombospondin-1 (TSP1, encoded by the <italic>THBS1</italic> gene)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, patient-derived glioblastoma cells from functionally connected intratumoral regions are characterized by a proliferative and invasive phenotype in the presence of neurons. The fundamental discovery that the tumor microenvironment regulates malignant growth in an activity-dependent manner raises questions about additional cellular factors that may alter or drive glioblastoma proliferation. Intriguingly, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of patient tumor samples has revealed that TSP1 is predominantly expressed by glioblastoma cells within highly functionally connected (termed HFC) intratumoral regions, in addition to astrocytes and myeloid cells. In contrast, astrocytes emerge as the primary source of TSP1 expression in the lowly functionally connected (termed LFC) regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. This observation suggests distinct gene expression programs between HFC and LFC intratumoral regions. Myeloid cells, represented by microglia, emerge in early development, respond to the local environment by altering their molecular and phenotypic states, and regulate neuronal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Moreover, glioblastoma cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) engage in bidirectional crosstalk, where glioblastoma cells attract TAMs and the TAMs promote glioblastoma cell proliferation and invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, preventing T-cell-mediated immune attack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, activity-dependent glioblastoma proliferation may be governed by crosstalk between neurons, immune cells, and glioblastoma cells, which remains poorly understood.</p><p id="Par5">This knowledge gap is paramount to address, as gaining a deeper understanding of immune-modulating mechanisms can unlock new therapeutic opportunities. Despite extensive efforts, and unlike the clinical success observed in various other malignancies over the past decade, cancer immunotherapy has yet to demonstrate efficacy for patients with glioblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, identification of immune-modulating factors unique to the central nervous system could provide valuable insights for developing distinctive approaches and pave the way for successful immunotherapeutic interventions.</p><p id="Par6">In this work, we demonstrate that glioma-neuronal circuit remodeling is strongly linked with regional immunosuppression and identify glioblastoma cell-derived TSP1 as a causal mediator of the suppressive immune microenvironment in the context of distinct patterns of glioma-neuronal circuit remodeling and neuronal activity. Furthermore, we show that pharmacological inhibition of glutamatergic excitatory signaling using an FDA-approved drug reprograms the immune microenvironment of intracerebral glioblastoma, specifically toward a less anti-inflammatory phenotype of TAMs, resulting in prolonged survival.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Functionally connected intratumoral regions have distinct immunological programs</title><p id="Par7">We aimed to better understand the distinctive transcriptional programs between tumor and immune cells from HFC and LFC regions characterized by intratumoral connectivity and local neuronal activity. Therefore, we re-analyzed the previously reported single-cell RNA-seq (sc-RNA-seq) datasets of clinical samples, in which annotations as either HFC- or LFC-derived had been assigned based on presurgical MEG and MRI imaging analyses (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. We performed differential gene expression (DGE) analyses followed by gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA). The unbiased testing of 50 pathways from the MSigDB Hallmark collection revealed that numerous immune-related gene signatures were among the most significantly downregulated pathways in HFC compared with LFC regions (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These downregulated pathways included <italic>inflammatory response</italic>, <italic>interferon-&#x00251;</italic> and <italic>-&#x003b3; responses</italic>, and <italic>TNF&#x00251; signaling</italic> via <italic>NF&#x003ba;B pathway</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a&#x02013;c</xref>). These findings were consistently observed across multiple cell populations&#x02014;tumor, myeloid, and lymphoid cells&#x02014;while not in astrocytes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). In contrast, the glycolysis pathway was consistently upregulated in HFC areas across all three cell types (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a&#x02013;c</xref>), suggesting enhanced local neuronal activity and glucose consumption within these intratumoral regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Signature scoring analyses, both at the single-cell level and through pseudo-bulk analysis, corroborated that the pathways of the <italic>inflammatory response</italic>, <italic>interferon-&#x003b3; response</italic>, and <italic>TNF&#x00251; signaling</italic> via <italic>NF&#x003ba;B</italic> tend to be downregulated in HFC region cells compared to LFC region cells across the cell types in common (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

These findings led us to hypothesize that glioblastoma-intrinsic functional connectivity, which promotes the malignant behavior of glioblastoma, is associated with immune regulatory programs involving multiple cell types within these regions. Therefore, we aimed to investigate evidence of the relationship between the immune system and neuronal activity in glioblastoma.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Distinct immune-related gene expression programs and tumor-associated macrophage compositions in functionally connected intratumoral regions of human glioblastoma.</title><p><bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>c</bold> Bar plots summarizing the results of gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) with MSigDB Hallmark collection comparing HFC vs. LFC within tumor cells (<bold>a</bold>), myeloid cells (<bold>b</bold>), and lymphoid cells <bold>c</bold>.

We defined CD45+CD11b+F4/80+ cells as TAMs and characterized them by staining for CD86 and CD206 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16a</xref>). TAMs isolated from WT tumors predominantly exhibited a CD86-CD206+ profile, suggesting an anti-inflammatory phenotype. In contrast, cells isolated from KO tumors consistently demonstrated polarization toward a CD86+CD206&#x02212; profile, indicating a pro-inflammatory phenotype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16b</xref>). Correspondingly, the ratio of pro-inflammatory (CD86+/CD206&#x02212;) to anti-inflammatory (CD86&#x02212;/CD206+) TAMs was significantly higher in those isolated from KO tumors compared with their WT counterparts (mean: 0.58 [WT] vs. 1.34 [KO]; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Moreover, we interrogated whether TAMs isolated from TSP1-WT and KO tumors would exhibit functional differences. We isolated CD11b+ cells from BILs, confirmed that over 90% were TAMs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref>), and assessed their suppressive effects on T-cell proliferation. In a co-culture assay with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled T-cells derived from a healthy donor mouse, CD11b+ cells from TSP1-KO tumors showed significantly less suppressive capacity on T-cell proliferation compared with their WT counterparts (proliferating CD3+ T-cells: mean: 7.5% [WT] vs. 17.7% [KO], <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03; proliferating CD8+ T-cells: 11.3% vs. 26.8%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18</xref>). These data indicate that eliminating tumor-derived TSP1 significantly alleviates the immunosuppressive state of the tumor microenvironment.</p><p id="Par22">We also performed co-culture experiments with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and SB28-TSP1-WT or KO tumor cells to test whether the observed differences in TAM phenotypes are primarily attributable to tumor-secreted TSP1. Interestingly, no significant differences were observed between the effects of TSP1-WT and KO cells on the transcript levels of the tested pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers in BMDMs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref>). The discrepancies between the in vitro and in vivo effects of SB28-TSP1-WT and KO tumor cells may suggest complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment, involving multiple cell types beyond tumor and immune cells.</p><p id="Par23">Furthermore, we characterized CD45+CD3+ tumor-infiltrating T-cell populations using flow cytometry. As SB28 tumors are intrinsically characterized by sparse T-cell infiltration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, we were able to recover only a limited number of T-cells, which may have impeded a comprehensive examination. Nevertheless, the analysis revealed a marked disparity in the cellular composition between the WT and KO tumors. The percentage of CD3+ T-cells within the CD45+ cells was slightly higher in KO tumors (mean: 4.3% [WT] vs. 7.1% [KO]; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.13) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20a&#x02013;c</xref>).

In both groups, over 95% of the CD8+ T-cell populations displayed an effector or memory phenotype, and no significant differences were observed in the expression of key activation or exhaustion markers in CD8+ T-cells between the two groups (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20d, e</xref>). However, there was a discernible trend: PD-1 expression appeared slightly elevated in KO tumors, while TIM-3 expression was modestly higher in WT samples (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20e</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">Taken together, these findings demonstrate that TSP1 knockout in tumor cells not only suppresses glioma-associated hyperexcitability but also modulates immune responses by increasing the infiltration and functional capacity of pro-inflammatory TAMs and enhancing the abundance of CD8+ T-cells within the glioblastoma tumor microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>AMPAR inhibition as a strategy to mitigate immunosuppression</title><p id="Par25">Analyses of human clinical data and subsequent preclinical investigations, including gene perturbation studies, underscore the critical role of tumor-derived TSP1 in glioma-associated hyperexcitability and the accompanying regional immunosuppression. Furthermore, analysis of bulk RNA-seq data comparing in vivo TSP1-WT and KO tumors revealed a significant upregulation of glutamatergic signaling pathways in the WT tumors, as well as significantly higher AMPA receptor (AMPAR) gene expression scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> compared with their KO counterparts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21a</xref>). Although both glutamatergic and GABAergic signals were upregulated in the WT tumors, the shifts in glutamatergic signaling pathways were more prominent than those in GABAergic pathways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21b&#x02013;e</xref>). Notably, TSP1 is described as a major driver of excitatory signaling by promoting glutamate release from TSP1-induced synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Moreover, as discussed earlier, the absence of notable differences in BMDM reprogramming effects between SB28-TSP1-WT and KO cells in vitro (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref>) led us to hypothesize that excitatory neuronal synaptic activity may drive immunosuppression in the context of hyperexcitable glioblastoma. To test this hypothesis, we selected perampanel (PER), an FDA-approved, anti-epileptic drug currently used in clinical practice and under investigation in clinical trials for glioblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, for evaluation in an in vivo syngeneic orthotopic model.</p><p id="Par26">First, we investigated the BILs isolated from PER-treated and untreated mouse brains. Flow cytometry analysis showed that CD45+CD11b+F4/80+ TAM populations in the PER-treated group were less polarized toward the anti-inflammatory phenotype and more toward the pro-inflammatory phenotype compared to the control group (the ratio of pro-inflammatory [CD86+/CD206&#x02212;] to anti-inflammatory [CD86&#x02212;/CD206+]: mean: 0.83 [Ctrl] vs. 1.63 [PER]; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">22</xref>). Moreover, in a co-culture assay using CFSE dye-labeled T-cells, TAMs isolated from PER-treated mice displayed a trend toward reduced suppressive capacity on T-cell proliferation compared to the control group, although not statistically significant (proliferating CD3+ cells: mean: 7.7% vs. 14.8%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.08; proliferating CD8+ cells: 12.1% vs. 23.2%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">23</xref>). These results were similar to the observed differences between TSP1-WT and KO tumors. Regarding T-cell profiles, while we observed a trend toward increased CD8+ T-cells in PER-treated mice, the increase was not statistically significant and was less pronounced than that observed in TSP1-KO compared to TSP1-WT tumors (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">24a</xref>). Similarly, when evaluating activation and exhaustion markers, no significant changes were observed (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">24b, c</xref>). As for survival, consistent with previous studies testing glutamate modulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, treatment with PER significantly prolonged the overall survival of C57BL/6J mice bearing SB28-TSP1-WT tumors, although it was not curative (median survival: 23 days [vehicle] vs. 27.5 days [PER], Log-rank test <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Interestingly, when we treated SB28-TSP1-KO tumor-bearing mice with PER or vehicle control, no significant differences in survival durations or surface marker expression profiles on BILs were observed (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">25</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">26</xref>). These findings align with the notion that glutamatergic excitatory signaling is a significant outcome of TSP1-induced synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. As such, it is plausible that the mechanisms of action for TSP1 elimination and PER treatment may overlap and converge to plateau. These results highlight the potential of neuronal activity-oriented therapeutic interventions, such as PER, to reshape the tumor microenvironment of hyperexcitable glioblastoma toward a less immunosuppressive state.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>TSP1-mediated immunosuppression and therapeutic implications of targeting glutamatergic excitatory signals.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Flow cytometry of brain-infiltrating leukocytes (BILs) using a tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-related marker panel in perampanel (PER)-treated and untreated mice with SB28-TSP1-WT tumors.

As described earlier, both TSP1 elimination in tumor cells and PER treatment modulated the glioblastoma tumor microenvironment toward a more pro-inflammatory phenotype. Nonetheless, neither intervention proved curative in our preclinical investigations. This could be attributed to the limited abundance of CD3+/CD8+ T-cells and the elevated expression of exhaustion markers, even after the interventions described above. These observations prompted us to investigate combination immunotherapy involving adoptive T-cell therapy.</p><p id="Par28">Specifically, we tested anti-EGFRvIII CAR T-cell therapy in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody, with or without PER, in mice bearing EGFRvIII-expressing SB28 (TSP1-WT) tumors (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">27a, b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. After randomization into two groups, the mice were treated with an anti-PD-1 antibody (twice per week, six doses in total) and either PER or a control, starting on day 7. Additionally, all mice underwent systemic lymphodepletion on day 11 post-tumor inoculation, followed by intravenous infusion of anti-EGFRvIII-CAR T-cells (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> cells per mouse) on day 12. Regarding the survival benefit, the difference did not reach statistical significance: the median survival was 42 days in the PER-treated group compared to 39 days in the control group (Log-rank <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.34) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">27c</xref>). However, intriguingly, complete tumor eradication was observed in 4 out of 9 (44%) PER-treated mice, compared to 2 out of 9 (22%) in the control group (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.62) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">27d</xref>). On day 50 post-inoculation, after repeatedly observing the absence of tumor BLI signals, we euthanized all surviving mice, isolated BILs, and analyzed them by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">27e</xref>). Among the five samples available (two from the control and three from the PER-treated group), CD45.1+ infused CAR T-cells were detected in all PER-treated mice (range, 0.35&#x02013;2.75% within CD3+ T-cells) but were absent in one of the two control group mice (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">27f</xref>). Over 80% of the persistent CAR T-cells were CD8+ T-cells, and nearly all cells expressed activation and exhaustion markers (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">27g, h</xref>). Notably, a memory phenotype (defined by CD62L+CD44+), which is associated with long-term tumor remission after CAR T-cell therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, was observed exclusively in the PER-treated group, but not in the control group (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">27i</xref>). This may suggest a potential role of neuronal activity-targeted intervention in enhancing CAR T-cell persistence. Although these descriptive data indicate a modest additive effect of PER, they underscore the need for further investigation into this therapeutic approach.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par29">Advancements in cancer neuroscience research have revealed unique features and treatment resistance mechanisms specific to brain tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

Building on this knowledge, our interdisciplinary investigation integrates cancer neuroscience, cancer immunology, and neuroimmunology to examine how glioblastoma remodels neuronal circuits to evade immune surveillance.</p><p id="Par30">In this study, we uncover a previously unrecognized process in which glioma-neuronal interactions contribute to regional immunosuppression within the cortex remodeled by glioblastoma infiltration.

Expanding on the foundational knowledge established by Krishna et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> regarding TSP1&#x02019;s role in glioma-neuronal circuit interactions, we mechanistically demonstrate that TSP1-expressing glioblastoma regions with HFC exhibit significant suppression of key immune response pathways, accompanied by an increase in immunosuppressive TAMs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Spatial transcriptomic analysis in human cases and preclinical glioblastoma models reveals an inverse relationship between neuronal activity-related and inflammatory response signatures. Further, our SB28-TSP1-WT/KO model determines the role of TSP1 in modulating both the cellular composition and immune functionality of the tumor microenvironment. These findings confirm that glioma-neuronal circuit remodeling is strongly linked with regional immunosuppression, corroborating recent findings from other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">Beyond these mechanistic insights, our study advances experimental models for investigating glioma-neuronal-immune interactions. By leveraging the syngeneic SB28 mouse glioma model and integrating in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo systems, we provide a framework to dissect these interactions under controlled conditions. Moreover, our findings have direct therapeutic implications, as we show that inhibiting glutamatergic signaling can reverse immunosuppression, potentially enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapies. While previous studies have explored the role of perampanel (PER) and other glutamate receptor antagonists in glioma-neuron interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, our study is among the first to link these treatments with immune modulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Although our preclinical results did not reach statistical significance in combination therapy settings, they lay the groundwork for future investigations into potential synergy between anti-epileptic drugs and immunotherapy. Given the parallels between our findings and clinical observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, targeting glioma-neuronal crosstalk may represent a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention.</p><p id="Par32">Despite the progress made in our study, several important questions remain to be answered. Firstly, the involvement of other cell types, such as astrocytes, in regulating inflammatory responses requires further investigation, particularly in light of recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Secondly, the specific neuronal activity-related molecules responsible for immunomodulation have yet to be identified. Our in vivo observations reveal favorable effects of PER treatment on mouse survival and TAM polarization toward a less anti-inflammatory state, indicating that the impact of TSP1 on the immune tumor microenvironment in glioblastoma is likely mediated in a neuronal activity-dependent manner. Additionally, the exclusive use of SB28 model represents an essential limitation of this study, and future investigations employing additional syngeneic models will help strengthen and expand our findings. Conversely, synaptic input to glioblastoma cells might also alter their transcriptomic profile, potentially affecting the production and release of TSP1. Further investigations are necessary to explore these hypotheses and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the bidirectional communication between glioma cells and neurons, which regulate the recruitment and phenotype of immune cells, including TAMs. Thirdly, as indicated in this study testing the combination of CAR-T, ICB, and PER, there is potential for therapeutic interventions targeting neuronal activity to enhance the efficacy of immune cell therapies. While our data demonstrate promising reprogramming of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, more research is warranted to advance cancer immunotherapy against glioblastoma. Addressing these questions will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying glioma-neuron-immune crosstalk and open new avenues for cancer immunotherapy combined with strategies targeting glioblastoma&#x02019;s neuronal activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study approval</title><p id="Par33">For all human tissue studies, written informed consent was obtained from all patients, and tissue samples were used in accordance with the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) institutional review board (IRB) for human research as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

Tissue Optimization and Library preparation were carried out according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (10X Genomics, CG000408 Rev A). Briefly, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks were made from mouse brain tissue harboring tumors collected immediately post-euthanasia and cardiac perfusion with PBS. Tissues were placed in 4% Paraformaldehyde for 24-h fixation and replaced with 70% EtOH until ready for processing. Tissues were processed and embedded into FFPE blocks on the Sakura VIP 6 and Tissue Tek 5 embedder, respectively, at the UCSF Neurosurgery Brain Tumor Center (BTC) Biorepository. Quality control of tissue blocks was performed by extracting RNA from FFPE samples using the Qiagen RNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen, 73504), followed by the assessment on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent, 5067-1513). The DV200 values were confirmed to be 67% and 70%, meeting the minimum requirement of no less than 50%. Then, 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;m-thick sections were mounted onto each spatially barcoded capture area of the Visium Spatial Gene Expression slide.

Probe ligation was followed by the release of single-strand product from the tissue and binding to the Visium slide. Probe extension then added the unique molecular identifier (UMI), spatial barcode, and partial Read 1. Following the elution of samples from the Visium slide, one microliter of each sample was subjected to 25 cycles of qPCR. The optimal amplification cycles were determined using the Cq values at the exponential phase of the amplification plot, which is roughly 25% of the peak fluorescence.
