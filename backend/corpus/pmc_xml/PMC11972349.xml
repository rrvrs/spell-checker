Necroptosis, a form of cell death, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. However, the precise characteristics and mechanisms of necroptosis in ARDS remain unclear. Thus, our study seeks to elucidate the specific alterations and regulatory factors associated with necroptosis in ARDS and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the disease. We discovered that necroptosis mediates the progression of ALI through the activation and formation of the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL complex. Moreover, we substantiated the involvement of both MYD88 and TRIF in the activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway in ALI. Furthermore, we have developed a lipid micelle-encapsulated drug targeting MLKL in alveolar type II epithelial cells and successfully applied it to treat ALI in mice. This targeted nanoparticle selectively inhibited necroptosis, thereby mitigating epithelial cell damage and reducing inflammatory injury. Our study delves into the specific mechanisms of necroptosis in ALI and proposes novel targeted therapeutic agents, presenting innovative strategies for the management of ARDS.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">A lipid micelle-encapsulated drug targeting MLKL in alveolar type II epithelial cells successfully applied in ALI treatment.

Currently, the treatment strategies for ALI/ARDS in clinical practice mainly involve conservative supportive therapies such as low tidal volume positive pressure ventilation, prone position ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and restrictive fluid management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Regarding pharmacological treatments, there are currently no specific drugs for ARDS. Dysregulation of the inflammatory response is a key factor in its development, with excessive inflammation leading to diffuse damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Alveolar epithelial cell is a crucial component of the alveolar-capillary barrier, playing key roles in both barrier function and immune regulation. Epithelial cell damage and dysfunction are not only key features of alveolar injury in ARDS, but also play an important role in the development and progression of ARDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The disruption of the alveolar epithelial barrier leads to increased permeability, inflammatory cell infiltration, and pulmonary edema, ultimately resulting in impaired gas exchange and severe hypoxemia. Moreover, the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines by damaged epithelial cells can further exacerbate the inflammatory response and contribute to the pathogenesis of ARDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Therefore, strategies aimed at reducing the inflammatory response while simultaneously protecting and repairing the alveolar epithelium represent promising therapeutic approaches.</p><p id="Par4">Necroptosis is in a special position among all cell death processes, it has been shown to be a type of regulated cell death (RCD), but exhibits non-RCD similar morphological features, triggers an inflammatory response in the body and is part of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. It is now well established that in LPS-induced ARDS, the inhibition of Caspase-8 and the activation of TLR4, MYD88, TRIF, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL play significant roles at various levels. Among these, the formation of complexes between RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, along with the membrane translocation of MLKL, represents the most critical steps in this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Notable advances on the role of necroptosis in disease progression and corresponding interventions have been made in the tumor, skin and cardiovascular diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Activation of the necroptosis pathway during ARDS leads to the release of pro-inflammatory signals, which can contribute to the overall inflammatory response, amplifying the inflammatory cascade and exacerbating the condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, despite these insights, targeted therapies focusing on necroptosis as a therapeutic approach for ARDS remain limited. Further research is needed to explore and develop strategies aimed at inhibiting necroptosis to mitigate inflammation and improve clinical outcomes in ARDS patients.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we propose that necroptosis plays a key role in acute lung injury, characterized by the phosphorylation and complex formation of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL. Additionally, the activation of TLR4 downstream signaling pathways, including TRIF and MYD88, is implicated. To target necroptosis as a therapeutic approach for acute lung injury, we have developed a lipid micelle-encapsulated MLKL inhibitor, GW806742X, which effectively alleviates airway inflammation and injury by selectively binding to alveolar type II epithelial cells. Our research reveals new pathological mechanisms underlying acute respiratory distress syndrome and paves the way for innovative targeted treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Transcriptomic analysis revealed the activation of the necroptosis pathway in acute lung injury</title><p id="Par7">To investigate whether the necroptosis pathway is activated in the pre-ARDS phase, we administered airway drops to mice using Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to simulate the acute lung injury that occurs during the early phase of ARDS in the clinic.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the necroptosis pathway, a full list of genes associated with necroptosis and apoptosis were downloaded from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). This list was then cross-referenced with extensive literature review to ensure its accuracy and completeness. Subsequently, this curated gene list was utilized to generate a heat map representing mRNA expression levels in both ALI and control mice <bold>(</bold>Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1b</xref><bold>)</bold>. The results of the heatmap showed that the vast majority of the genes visualised showed a significant up-regulation in expression, suggesting the possibility of high activation of the pathway in which they are located.

Nevertheless, we observed inhibition of the necroptosis pathway in HBE when either MYD88 or TRIF was blocked. Additionally, in our study, we observed an increase in the phosphorylation of IKK and IRF3 downstream of MYD88 and TRIF after the intervention with LPS. The concurrent activation of both pathways may be associated with the ability of LPS to evade endosomes created through TLR4-mediated endocytosis, or with the reduction of intracellular CD14. Previous findings have revealed that the activation of TRIF relies heavily on intracellular CD14, and when intracellular CD14 levels are depleted, cellular TLR4 signaling shifts towards downstream transmission via the MYD88 pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. However, the sequencing of activation for the MYD88 and TRIF pathways in the two aforementioned theories contradicts the proposition put forth by Reynoso et al.

Nevertheless, as we have previously validated, these conclusions cannot be applied to sepsis models. The conclusions drawn from our study are specific to lung injury caused by direct factors (pulmonary factors).
