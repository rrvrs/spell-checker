This study aimed to evaluate whether <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> p23-specific IgY antibodies could control neonatal calf diarrhea caused by <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic>. Methods: A recombinant immunogen comprising the p23 protein fused to the antigen-presenting cell homing (APCH) molecule was expressed using the baculovirus system. Hens were immunized with the APCH-p23 immunogen, and the resulting IgY was spray-dried for treatment use. Eight newborn calves were included in the study and received commercial colostrum within the first 12 h of life. Four calves were treated with 20 g of powdered egg containing IgY (p23-specific IgY titer of 256 in milk) twice daily for 7 days. The remaining four calves received regular non-supplemented milk. All calves were orally infected with 6 million oocysts and monitored for 21 days. Results: Calves treated with p23-specific IgY exhibited significantly reduced diarrhea duration (3.5 vs. 7.5 days; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.0397) and oocyst shedding duration (6.50 vs. 12 days; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.0089). In addition, the total number of excreted oocysts, as measured by the change of the area under the curve (AUC), was significantly reduced in the treated group (14.25 vs. 33.45; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.0117). Although the onset of diarrhea was delayed (3.5 to 6.5 days post-infection; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.1840), and diarrhea severity was reduced (24.25 to 17 AUC; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.1236), both parameters were not statistically significant. Conclusions: P23-specific IgY antibodies effectively reduced the <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic>-induced duration of diarrhea in experimentally infected calves. These findings highlight the potential of this passive treatment as a promising strategy for controlling neonatal calf diarrhea.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium parvum</italic></kwd><kwd>neonatal diarrhea</kwd><kwd>calves</kwd><kwd>IgY</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Producci&#x000f3;n de Terapias Innovadoras contra <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium parvum</italic></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Instituto Nacional de Tecnolog&#x000ed;a Agropecuaria, Argentina</funding-source><award-id>2023-PD-L01-I116</award-id><award-id>2023-PD-L01-I118</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Ministerio de Ciencia, Argentina</funding-source><award-id>PICT-2018_03314</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas</funding-source><award-id>PUE-2019-2024_22920180100066CO</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by Producci&#x000f3;n de Terapias Innovadoras contra <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>.

Introduction</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> species are unicellular eukaryotic parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Of these, <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> is considered the principal pathogen associated with neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) in cattle worldwide [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As a zoonotic species, <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> is particularly relevant from a One Health perspective because it also causes cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent patients and the elderly and high mortality in toddlers in some regions of the world [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> in dairy calves is highly variable, ranging from 0% to more than 40% [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Argentina, the prevalence of calves up to 20 days of age varied between 25.2% and 42.5% depending on the region, as shown in at least five independent large-scale epidemiological studies reviewed in de Alba et al., 2023 [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> parasites display a monoxenous life cycle, including asexual and sexual reproduction. Infected calves shed large numbers of oocysts in their feces, contaminating the environment. Typically, oocysts remain infective for several months in water and moist environments and are resistant to high concentrations of chlorine [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Transmission to a new host occurs via the fecal&#x02013;oral route, either by direct contact with contaminated feces or indirectly by ingestion of water or food contaminated with oocysts. Once ingested by the host, oocysts excyst and invade the cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Successive cycles of asexual and sexual reproduction generate massive numbers of oocysts that are excreted into the environment with feces [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Among surface antigens that have been described to be expressed in the different parasite stages, there is p23, a 23 kDa glycoprotein, which is located on the surface of oocyst but also on the surface of sporozoites and merozoites [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. P23 is antigenically conserved across geographically diverse isolates, has neutralization-sensitive epitopes, and is deposited in trails during the initial stages of infection [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As a vaccine, p23 has been used in pregnant heifers to produce hyperimmune colostrum to protect calves against cryptosporidiosis [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, p23 has been used as an immunogen to generate p23-specific IgY for the passive immunization of animals and humans against cryptosporidiosis with promising results [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>A novel approach for effective bovine immunization is fusing the vaccine candidate p23 to the antigen-presenting cell homing (APCH) molecule. The APCH molecule is a single-chain antibody against an invariant of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) epitope, which targets the vaccine candidate to the antigen-presenting cell (APC) facilitating the development of a specific adaptive immune response. The development and testing of APCH was originally conducted in swine; however, subsequent studies demonstrated its capacity for cross-reactivity with MHC-II in other species, including bovines [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The baculovirus&#x02013;insect cell expression system was chosen to express the APCH-p23 immunogen as it is one of the most widely used tools for the high-level expression of heterologous proteins in eukaryotic hosts. Besides the advantage of high-level expression, the insect cells are capable of post-translational modifications similar to those found in mammalian cells. Furthermore, the baculovirus system is characterized by its safety, ease of use, and its capacity for straightforward scaling up [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Currently, no efficient treatments are available for the control of bovine cryptosporidiosis. Treatment with the coccidiostat halofuginone has important limitations, such as its toxicity with slightly increased doses, while the antibiotic paromomycin is not available in Argentina. Recently, a subunit vaccine based on recombinant gp40 of <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> for use in pregnant cows has been approved but is unavailable in many South American countries [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, passive immunization using egg yolk, sometimes referred to as IgY technology, has been studied for many viral and bacterial pathogens [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. IgY technology is based on the inoculation of hens with the immunogen of interest to produce antigen-specific IgY immunoglobulins.

Fecal IgM and IgA responses were found to be associated with parasite clearance and the resolution of diarrhea in both groups (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00162-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). The peaks of fecal IgA responses (~4096) were detected at PID 9 in the p23-specific IgY-treated group and at PID 11 in the control group. The fecal IgM responses (~4096) peaked earlier at PID 7 in the p23-specific IgY group compared to PID 12 in the control group. Low levels of IgG were detected in the fecal samples, with a peak at PID 9 in the p23-specific IgY group (~256) and a peak at PID 10 in the control group (~128). IgY Abs in fecal samples were detected intermittently and in low titers in treated calves until three days after the end of the treatment. In serum, IgA, IgM, and IgG Ab responses were of similar magnitude in both treated and control groups (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00162-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). However, the peak of p23-specific serum IgG was at PID 15 in the IgY-treated group while at PID 21 in the control group.

Discussion</title><p>We evaluated the efficacy of p23-specific IgY treatment in neonatal calves experimentally infected with <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> to reduce clinical symptoms and oocyst shedding. For this purpose, we generated an experimental vaccine by using a recombinant APCH-p23 immunogen to produce a p23-specific IgY product. Bioinnovo S.A, a Start-up company from Argentina, used and validated APCH as an auxiliary component in a biotechnological vaccine to control bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) in cattle [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which showed an outstanding performance in beef and dairy herds in Argentina [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. APCH is a single-chain Ab directed to the MHC-II antigen epitope and has been designated as a potent immunomodulating molecule improving both humoral and cellular immune responses in immunized animals as it targets the antigen to the APCs (antigen-presenting cells) [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The passive vaccination procedure tested in this study is based on the p23 antigen, which belongs to a family of 23&#x02013;27 kDa surface antigens that are expressed in different parasite stages during the life cycle of <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic>. Immunostaining analysis using indirect fluorescent antibodies showed that p23 can be recognized on the surface of oocysts [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Importantly, as a recombinant antigen, p23 has been tested in vaccination trials of pregnant heifers and shown to generate hyperimmune colostrum, mitigating severe diarrhea and oocyst shedding in neonatal calves [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that p23 has neutralization-sensitive epitopes [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Additionally, other surface antigens such as gp40 and gp900 have been demonstrated to contain neutralization-sensitive epitopes that represent targets of vaccine or monoclonal antibodies for the development of effective control strategies [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B34-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The production of antigen-specific IgY has been applied to a wide range of pathogens, and its production in chickens is a more sustainable and economic way of generating polyclonal antibodies for passive immunization or immunotherapeutic procedures [<xref rid="B34-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We previously demonstrated that rotavirus A and bovine coronavirus-specific IgY antibodies reduced or even prevented clinical signs of each viral infection in newborn calves [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Recently, we demonstrated that the enteropathogen <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> is the major cause of neonatal calf diarrhea in Argentina, motivating us to test the efficacy of <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> antigen-specific IgY for the treatment of this ubiquitous yet neglected parasitic infection [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In several studies, it has been shown that IgY Abs produced against oocyst lysate or recombinant p23 or gp60 of <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> could decrease oocyst excretion in mice [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This urged us to test whether antigen-specific IgY is effective in the prevention and/or treatment of diarrheic calves. In our approach, immunity is conferred by p23-specific IgY produced in chicken as compared to the immunity conferred to calves via p23-specific IgG in colostrum generated after immunizing pregnant heifers. Importantly, the p23-specific IgY product allows high flexibility in the number of applied doses and the application scheme, and besides conferring passive immunity, it may also be applied in an immunotherapeutic procedure to cure calves already diarrheic. In the present study, calves were inoculated with six million oocysts at 48&#x02013;72 h of life. This amount is comparable to the inoculation with ten million oocysts at 12 h of life that had been applied by Perryman et al. and Askari et al. [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or the one million from the study of Bhalchandra and collaborators [<xref rid="B39-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, other authors used a reduced number of oocysts (e.g., 1000) to infect calves for vaccine efficacy studies [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which is in line with Zambriski and collaborators, who observed that 50 oocysts are sufficient to consistently produce diarrhea and oocyst shedding [<xref rid="B40-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, it needs to be considered that <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> is a highly endemic parasite on dairy farms in Argentina with the potential for high natural infection doses. The present study evaluates a passive treatment administered for 14 consecutive days so that antibodies are continuously present in the gut, as opposed to a vaccine efficacy study where the dam is vaccinated, and the calf is passively protected by a single ingestion of hyperimmune colostrum. Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that the prolonged presence of p23-specific IgY in the gut lumen would be able to attenuate the clinical disease of severe cryptosporidiosis in calves, even when challenged with a very high number of oocysts.</p><p>After challenge, we observed that control calves shed <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> oocysts and developed diarrhea for an average of 7.5 days starting at 3.5 days post-inoculation, which is similar to what has been shown in other studies when infected calves were fed with commercial colostrum [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B40-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It needs to be highlighted that in this efficacy study, calves were fed with commercially available colostrum with a p23-specific IgG titer of 16384. This titer is rather low, considering that IgG1 is concentrated in the colostrum to confer an efficient immune transfer to the calf. However, information on colostrum antibodies and their association with <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic>-induced diarrhea is scarce. Some authors report that the level of parasite-specific antibodies in colostrum correlates with the prevention of diarrhea caused by <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> [<xref rid="B41-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], but the minimum titer of parasite-specific Abs in the serum of calves after colostrum intake which is needed to prevent <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> diarrhea is still unknown. Thus, improving the colostrum quality by vaccination against <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> and supplementing the milk with parasite-specific IgY during the susceptible immunological window, when colostrum Abs decrease and host immune response begins to develop, has the potential to minimize or even prevent clinical signs of <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> infection under field conditions.</p><p>In the present study, calves fed with heterologous IgY with a high p23-specific IgY titer of 256 showed a delay in the onset of diarrhea and oocyst shedding compared to control animals, although this delay was not significant. In addition, the severity of diarrhea was shown to be non-significantly reduced in treated vs. non-treated control. In contrast, the clinical episodes, such as duration of diarrhea and oocyst shedding in IgY-treated calves, were significantly shorter in duration. Furthermore, IgY-treated calves shed significantly fewer oocysts (measured as the AUC of 18S rRNA gene copies) compared to the non-treated control group. This finding is consistent with that reported by Omidian et al. (2014), in which <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> p23-specific IgY was administered to immunosuppressed mice that had been inoculated with ten thousand oocysts resulting in a significantly lower oocyst excretion [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Additionally, Kobayashi and collaborators produced IgY by immunizing hens with an oocyst preparation and tested its efficacy in a mouse model. Treated mice showed shedding of a lower number of oocysts compared to control animals following inoculation with one thousand oocysts [<xref rid="B38-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. On the other hand, monoclonal Abs (mAb) directed to different epitopes of the infective <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> oocyst comprising anti-GP25-200, anti-P23, and anti-CSL proteins were tested in a mouse model by Schaefer and colleagues [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A pool of these three monoclonal antibodies (75 &#x000b5;g of each mAb per dose) was demonstrated to reduce the level of intestinal infection by 86% in mice challenged with thirty thousand oocysts, as measured by histopathological scores [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These results demonstrate that antibodies directed to different epitopes of the parasite can reduce oocyst shedding in mice, which suggests that they are also effective in the mitigation of diarrhea in calves.</p><p>It needs to be highlighted that the number of animals used in this study was estimated following animal welfare protocols and is supported with an acceptable statistical power for a preliminary efficacy study. Considering the observed positive effect of the p23-IgY treatment, a field trial with a higher number of animals and natural exposure to <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> will be carried out to substantiate the effectiveness of passive p23-IgY treatment. In addition, in future studies, a higher administration dose of 40 g with a final p23-specific IgY titer in milk of higher than 256 will be applied to test the hypothesis that this further improves the efficacy of the treatment.</p><p>In the present study, all calves from the control and treated groups received preventive antibiotic treatment to avoid undesirable infections of pathogenic bacteria. Recently, it has been shown that the decrease in short-chain fatty acids in the gut is associated with an increased <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> infection in mice [<xref rid="B42-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In this context, it is noteworthy that the presence of some bacteria, such as <italic toggle="yes">Megasphera</italic> spp., synthesize short-chain fatty acids [<xref rid="B43-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Although it is known that antibiotic treatment changes the gut microbiota and may affect <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> infection and disease, antibiotic treatment was applied to both groups and should, therefore, not influence the experimental result.</p><p>The study of the specific immune response of calves to <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> infection revealed that mucosal IgA and IgM responses were associated with clearance of the parasite infection in both study groups. Noteworthy, in treated calves, the level of this class of antibodies rises and peaks at an earlier PID than in control animals. Although these findings are similar to those observed by Wyatt et al., where mucosal antibodies were detected after diarrhea resolution, they seem to be counterintuitive [<xref rid="B44-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Currently, we do not have an explanation for this observation since both groups of animals had a similar onset of diarrhea and oocyst shedding. Furthermore, Peeters et al. described that the immune response after experimental and natural infection showed rising IgM levels in feces from PID 5 on, with a peak at PID 14, and IgA levels in feces rose between PID 7 and PID 14, which both coincided with a decreasing excretion of oocysts [<xref rid="B45-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Interestingly, IgG levels in feces rose slightly during oocyst shedding yet disappeared 3 weeks after post-infection [<xref rid="B45-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In the same study, anti-<italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> IgG levels in sera rose till oocyst excretion reached its maximum, whereas anti-<italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> IgA levels in sera peaked later than those of IgA levels in feces [<xref rid="B45-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Importantly, the immune response against <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> in calves is not fully understood; it has been reported that the innate immune response plays a key role in parasitic clearance in which IFN&#x003b3; produced by NK cells and macrophages had a protective effect [<xref rid="B46-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The inability of IFN&#x003b3; gene-knockout mice to control <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> infection was associated with reduced recruitment of macrophages and T cells to the lamina propria, suggesting this cytokine and immune cells play an important role in the control of the infection in mice [<xref rid="B48-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Experimental infections of mice or humans with <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic> induce mucosal IgG and IgA antibodies, which may correlate with the quantity of oocyst shedding in humans [<xref rid="B49-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the presented study, similar IgG, IgA, and IgM responses were found in sera of both study groups after infection with <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic>. Kaushik and collaborators observed a higher IgG and IgA titer in <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic>-infected human subjects compared to those that were uninfected [<xref rid="B50-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Importantly, a recent study that analyzed the protective impact of <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium</italic>-specific Ab in a cohort of Bangladesh children has found that Ab responses to antigens p23 and gp60 correlated with protection against reinfection [<xref rid="B51-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Finally, p23-specific IgY was found to be functional in fecal samples as tested during the complete treatment period, suggesting that IgY passes through the entire gastrointestinal tract without denaturation or functional neutralization, as has also been observed in previous studies [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of neutralization of p23-specific IgY. As mentioned before, mucosal immunity is highly important in <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic> infection, where p23 mucosal antibodies (mostly IgA) are produced, as was observed by Wyatt and collaborators [<xref rid="B52-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It has also been reported that after ingestion of egg yolk, molecules positively modulate the mucosal immune response, preventing pathogen entry [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B54-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>Recently, a vaccination for pregnant heifers based on recombinant gp40 was tested and shown to significantly reduce the incidence and severity of diarrhea in <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic>-infected calves [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00162" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This vaccine is available in European countries but not in Argentina. The presented passive immunization strategy of <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic>-infected calves using antigen-specific IgY resulted in a significantly reduced duration of diarrhea and oocyst excretion and has the advantage of treatment flexibility, as calves can still be treated in case pregnant heifers had not been previously immunized. Passive immunization using p23-specific IgY has the potential to reduce oocyst contamination in farms, thereby minimizing the risk of parasite transmission between calves and reducing the public risk of human infection due to environmental contamination. We have developed a sustainable, non-antibiotic treatment to control diarrhea in newborn calves caused by <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic>, which shows promising efficacy for controlling <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic>-associated diarrhea. Field trials under natural conditions are required to substantiate the efficacy of this development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-13-00162"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>We show that <italic toggle="yes">Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>-specific IgY treatment is a promising passive immunization strategy to control <italic toggle="yes">C. parvum</italic>-associated diarrhea.
