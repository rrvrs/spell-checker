Before PCA analysis, cognitive function test scores were checked for normal distribution. Participants with no cognitive function scores were excluded (N=60). Trails A test scores were inversed so that low test scores indicate poorer cognitive function and higher test scores indicate better cognitive function for all tests. Imputation via mean was used to impute any missing values for cognitive tests.

To capture PACs&#x02019; effect independent of age, we created proteomic age acceleration for each PAC as residuals by regressing PAC on chronological age in the remaining participants after excluding the training set at the corresponding visits. A positive value of age acceleration suggests that the proteomic age tends to be older than the person&#x02019;s chronological age (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). To understand the combination of proteins contributed to midlife and late-life PACs, we took a closer look at the overlapping aptamers (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix Table 3</xref>). There were 270 overlapping aptamers between midlife and late-life. At both timepoints we selected the top 10 proteins based on effect estimates for presentation herein.

The performance of the PACs were tested by (1) plotting the chronological age against PACs and (2) calculating median absolute error and Pearson correlation (r) with chronological age between PAC and chronological age.

The associations were independent of chronological age, demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Our results indicate that PACs can be considered as a tool to identify individuals at risk for cognitive impairment and developing dementia in future.</p><p id="P29">Prior studies investigated roles of different types of biological clocks in predicting future risk of cognitive impairment and dementia.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> For instance, various DNA methylation epigenetic clocks have been tested by multiple studies as marker for advanced cognitive aging and dementia incidence.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Combining the data in a systematic review and meta-analysis, Zhou et al. showed that majority of these studies did not show a significant association and concluded that there is insufficient evidence to indicate that epigenetic aging can serve as a valid biomarker to individuals at risk for cognitive impairment and dementia.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Such mixed and inconclusive results could be due to using a heterogenous group of DNA methylation aging clocks.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Prior studies have shown that proteins have the potential to serve as metrics for quantifying biological aging, potentially outperforming DNA methylation aging clocks.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Proteins can be more accurately measured than methylation CpG sites and are closer to phenotypic expression.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Moreover, in clinical contexts, proteins are more useful, as medical professionals routinely rely on plasma proteins as biomarkers for diagnosing medical conditions, predicting outcomes, and assessing treatment efficacy. Sathyan et al. showed that a higher age acceleration, using proteomics clocks, predicts risk of motor cognitive risk syndrome, a pre-dementia syndrome characterized by slow gait and subjective cognitive concerns.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> In the current study, we developed multiple PACs and showed that these clocks predict risk of dementia in both midlife and late-life in two separate cohorts consisting of different racial and ethnic groups. Future studies with focus on application of these clocks in clinical settings for prediction and patient risk stratification are warranted to bring the scientific evidence closer to clinical practice.</p><p id="P30">Notably, we observed a stronger association with risk of dementia when using clocks developed in late-life as opposed to those at midlife. This finding might reflect the dynamic nature of biological markers across the lifespan and highlight the importance of considering age-specific changes in disease prediction models. The stronger predictive value of PACs in older age can be due to the fact that there is a greater variability in protein levels in older age, potentially making it a more effective tool for discerning differences. In addition, with aging there is a progressive accumulation of molecular alterations, such as increased oxidative stress, impaired protein clearance mechanisms, and chronic inflammation.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> These age-related changes may contribute to distinct proteomic signatures that can better reflect the evolving pathological processes underlying dementia development in later life.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Another possibility is that late-life PACs are closer to the onset of dementia, making them potentially superior predictors. While proteomic alterations in midlife may reflect early pathological changes associated with dementia, they may not fully capture the complexity of the disease cascade that unfolds over several decades. To investigate whether the protein selection at older age is the driving factor, we constructed a PACs in older age using identified proteins from midlife, instead of those selected at late-life, then evaluated the association in the ARIC test set. While we observed a decline in the magnitude of effect estimates for dementia risk using this clock, the estimates remained stronger than midlife estimates, suggesting that the stronger late-life estimates are not solely due to the combination of proteins in the biological clock at late-life. As the effect estimate was still stronger than the midlife biological clock, it is possible that both factors mentioned earlier contribute to the difference between midlife and late-life estimates.</p><p id="P31">Dementia has a long preclinical phase which typically takes decades to manifest as cognitive function impairments. To explore whether the PACs can be used to predict dementia risk at earlier stages of cognitive decline, we evaluated the association of the clocks with cognitive function. While, both midlife and late-life clocks were associated with decrease in global cognition and executive function, only late-life clock was associated with memory function. A possible explanation could be that usually impairment in executive function precedes memory impairments before full-blown dementia is presented.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p><p id="P32">Our study had several strengths including large sample size, representation of different racial and ethnic groups, external validation of the results in an independent cohort, multiple assessment of proteomics over time, longitudinal data collection spanning midlife and late-life and availability of detailed information about patient characteristics and potential confounders. We also acknowledge several limitations of this study. First, information on dementia subtypes was not available in all participants and there were differences in the methods for ascertaining dementia between the two cohorts. In addition, ARIC and MESA used different cognitive tests to assess global and domain specific cognitive function. Nevertheless, we observed similar associations with both midlife and late-life clocks derived from ARIC study in MESA cohort, underscoring the robustness of our findings. Although we accounted for multiple demographic and cardiovascular factors, as well as <italic toggle="yes">APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 status in our analyses, given the observational nature of this study we cannot rule out the possible effect of unmeasured confounders in the observed associations. Third, PACs are limited in identifying proteins responsible for dementia risk that aren&#x02019;t age-related.</p><p id="P33">This study provides new evidence regarding the utility of PACs for predicting dementia and cognitive impairment. The robust link between proteomic profiles and future dementia risk, particularly in late life, has a potential for translation in clinical practice for early detection of high risk individuals and implementation of preventive strategies in individuals at risk.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplement 1</label><media xlink:href="NIHPPRS5500348v1-supplement-1.pdf" id="d67e605" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P34">The authors thank the other investigators, the staff, and the participants of the ARIC and MESA studies for their valuable contributions.
