These complexities are amplified by gender biases in the healthcare system and can lead to misdiagnosis, affecting both treatment planning and long-term outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec0859"><title>Objectives</title><p>There are differences and similarities between ASD and EUPD/BPD which encompass its own challenges in diagnosis and treatment</p><p>The presentation seeks to:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Offer an in-depth overview of the relationship between ASD and EUPD/BPD in young females.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Evaluate the diagnostic challenges associated with distinguishing between these two conditions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Discuss the practical implications of misdiagnosis on treatment and quality of life.
</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="sec0860"><title>Methods</title><p>Drawing from a rich corpus of evidence, including longitudinal studies (e.g., Kerns et al., 2015; Gunderson et al., 2018), meta-analyses, and patient case studies, the presentation adopts a multidisciplinary approach. It utilises clinical interviews, validated diagnostic tools such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5), as well as direct observation to provide a nuanced understanding of ASD and EUPD/BPD characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="sec0861"><title>Results</title><p><bold>Shared Characteristics:</bold> Both ASD and EUPD/BPD manifest challenges in social functioning and mood regulation, supported by studies indicating sensory sensitivities and affective dysregulation in both conditions (Zanarini et al., 2019; Happ&#x000e9; et al., 2019).</p><p><bold>Differentiating Factors:</bold> ASD individuals often struggle with verbal and non-verbal communication, whereas those with EUPD/BPD may excel in these areas but display emotional volatility and unstable relationships, substantiated by differing neurobiological markers (King-Casas et al., 2008; Minshew &#x00026; Williams, 2007).</p><p><bold>Misdiagnosis Risks:</bold> The failure to correctly diagnose these conditions may lead to ineffective or potentially harmful treatment plans (Zanarini et al., 2013; Solomon et al., 2012).</p><p><bold>Necessity for Comprehensive Assessment:</bold> A multimodal and culturally sensitive diagnostic approach is essential for accurate clinical evaluation (Mandy et al., 2012; Betancur et al., 2009).</p></sec><sec id="sec0862"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The complexities surrounding the accurate diagnosis of ASD and EUPD/BPD in young females necessitate a thorough and multifaceted approach. An incorrect diagnosis could have long-lasting implications, affecting not just the efficacy of therapeutic interventions but also the overall well-being and quality of life of the individual. This presentation underscores the critical importance of drawing from a robust body of evidence and utilising comprehensive diagnostic approaches to differentiate these conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec0863"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
