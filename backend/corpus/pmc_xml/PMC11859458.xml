Complete dentures are a widely adopted prosthetic solution for restoring oral functionality, esthetics, and quality of life in edentulous patients [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Notwithstanding their advantages, it is crucial to measure the occlusal force with full dentures to determine their chewing efficacy, which is contingent upon various factors, including the alignment of the dentures, the state of the supporting mucosal tissue, and the degree of patient acclimatization [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In addressing the challenges associated with traditional complete dentures, the incorporation of soft liners has emerged as a promising strategy to provide a cushioning intermediary between the inflexible denture base and oral mucosa, utilizing flexible materials such as silicone or acrylic composites. These liners are particularly effective in alleviating the pressure on mucosal surfaces, thereby enhancing patient comfort and improving retention. However, their effect on functional parameters, including occlusal force, remains a topic of ongoing investigation [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Babu et al. [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] concluded that the use of soft liners with complete dentures significantly reduced mandibular ridge resorption over a period of one year, compared to conventional denture wearers.</p><p>Bite force is a pivotal determinant in assessing the functional performance of dentures as it signifies a patient's capacity to effectively masticate food and sustain oral health. Previous studies have reported that 80% of conventional denture wearers experience pain while chewing food due to overloading of underlying soft tissues, complaining of masticatory insufficiency [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although soft liners may provide improved comfort by reducing the pressure on underlying soft tissues, their long-term influence on bite force is still unclear. In a randomized controlled trial by Alqutaibi et al. [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], it was concluded that soft liners showed a positive effect on bite force and patient comfort over a period of three months. Therefore, by comparing bite force measurements in patients with complete dentures with and without soft liners, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the clinical implications of soft liners and their role in optimizing prosthetic rehabilitation [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the bite force in patients wearing complete dentures with and without the use of soft liners.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study design and setting</p><p>This prospective cohort study was conducted in the Department of Prosthodontics at the Surendera Dental College and Research Institute, Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan, India, from April 2023 to December 2023. Ethical committee approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of Surendera Dental College and Research Institute (approval number: SDRI/IEC/22/35), and the study adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. All clinical and laboratory procedures were performed by a single operator to minimize variability.</p><p>Source of data</p><p>Convenience sampling was employed in this investigation, wherein patients attending the department for complete dentures were selected according to specific eligibility criteria. This was a prospective cohort study, as complete dentures were provided to patients based on their preferences (patients with previously ill-fitting dentures who chose complete dentures with soft liners for enhanced comfort and adaptability were categorized into Group 1, while others were assigned to Group 2), and the cohorts were monitored over a period of six months to assess bite force. Completely edentulous patients who desired a new set of complete dentures with a Class I ridge relationship with adequate interridge space and patients with good neuromuscular control were included in the study. Bruxers, patients with muscular dystrophy, patients without temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), and those who had difficulty understanding neurological or psychological problems were excluded from the study.&#x000a0;The sample size was estimated to be 20 per group, using G*Power Version 3.6.9 (Heinrich-Heine-Universit&#x000e4;t D&#x000fc;sseldorf, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany) at 90% power and 5% type 1 error for a clinically meaningful difference of 50 N in maximum bite force (MBF) at three months follow-up&#x000a0;from a previous study [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Considering the 10% dropout rate, the present study was conducted in 22 patients per group. Therefore, 44 patients were included in the study.</p><p>Methodology</p><p>The baseline characteristics were noted for all patients such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), maxillary and mandibular ridge height, duration of edentulism, and duration of usage of the last denture. In Group 2, complete dentures were fabricated in a conventional manner using a conventional heat-activated denture base resin (DPI, Mumbai, India). In Group 1, complete dentures were fabricated by providing a 2-mm wax spacer on&#x000a0;the master cast (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which were then duplicated to fabricate complete dentures (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Wax spacer of 2 mm placed in fabricating complete denture with soft liner.</title><p>Source:&#x000a0;Derived from a study participant's case, with consent obtained for publication.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000077988-i01" position="float"/></fig><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Duplicated casts for fabricating complete denture with soft liner.</title><p>Source: Derived from a study participant's case, with consent obtained for publication.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000077988-i02" position="float"/></fig><p>A long-term, heat-cured, plasticized acrylic liner (Permasoft, Dentsply International, York, PA, USA) was applied according to the manufacturer's instructions.

After the delivery of the dentures, subsequent appointments for refinement were scheduled until the patients reported comfort and were free of any soft tissue irritation. In case of irritation, clinicians adjusted the dentures to relieve any discomfort. Furthermore, in instances where early occlusal contact was detected during mandibular closure, modifications to the occlusion were implemented using articulating papers.</p><p>Bite force evaluation was performed for all patients after two months of denture delivery, which was considered sufficient for masticatory adaptation in a previous study [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Bite force was measured using a gnathodynamometer (Texon Co.

The outcomes of this research underscore notable disparities in MBF between the two cohorts as well as intragroup changes over time. These findings offer significant implications for the functional advantages of soft liners in enhancing mastication efficiency and overall patient satisfaction. The comparable baseline characteristics lend credibility to the study design and strengthen the validity of our findings.</p><p>The masticatory force generated by natural dentition is estimated to be approximately 200 N; in contrast, the peak forces encountered during mastication by individuals utilizing complete dentures generally fall within the range of 60-80 N [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As articulated in a previous study, only 4% of the functional forces are effectively utilized, whereas the MBF values recorded during mastication do not exceed 22% of their theoretical potential [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Factors such as muscular strength and number of functional teeth are of paramount importance in the mastication process. The magnitude of bite force has been shown to have a significant correlation with patient satisfaction with complete dentures, the nature of the food ingested, and the extent of bone resorption that transpires beneath prosthetic appliances. Sex influences variations in the dynamics of biting; therefore, sex-based differences in MBF were not evaluated in the present study [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. MBF was recorded in the first molar area, as nearly 80% of the force was found to be distributed in this area [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>A statistically significant enhancement in MBF was noted in both cohorts throughout the six-month follow-up period. In Group 1, the MBF increased from 46.07&#x000b1;12.28 N at the two-month interval to 66.34&#x000b1;13.81 N at the six-month assessment. Pain on chewing due to the compressibility of complete dentures is the most common complaint of patients. This is more common in the lower arch (63%) [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Soft liners impart a cushioning effect, which is likely to enhance patient comfort and promote superior adaptation of dentures to the oral mucosa [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Over time, this augmented comfort and fit may have played a role in the increased masticatory efficiency and bite force observed.</p><p>Denture wearers exert only one-fifth to one-fourth of the occlusal force and masticatory efficiency compared to individuals with normal dentition [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Users of complete dentures tend to reach their occlusal force capacity earlier than those with natural teeth, which may be attributed to the pressure exerted by the denture base on the underlying mucosa, ultimately leading to the attainment of the pain threshold. Consequently, the elevated MBF observed with the use of soft liners can be ascribed to the elasticity of the liner, which alleviates stress on the alveolar ridge mucosa, along with a heightened pain threshold, which enhances the resilience of the alveolar ridge mucosa against stress [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, in Group 2, the MBF increased from 38.32&#x000b1;12.61 N at two months to 49.41&#x000b1;10.89 N at six months. While this improvement was statistically significant, the magnitude of change was less pronounced than that in Group 1. The observed improvements in MBF in Group 2 may be attributed to the natural adaptation of patients to their dentures over time, as well as improvements in neuromuscular coordination. Moreover, with time, the inhibitory impact of psychological factors is minimized, which ensures imminent acceptance of complete dentures [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].&#x000a0;Similar results were reported in previous studies [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The authors used long-term, heat-cured, plasticized acrylic liners, which have been shown to display high MBF over conventional dentures over a follow-up period of three months [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similar results were reported in a study by Bahl et al. [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], who found significantly less mandibular ridge resorption in patients where complete dentures were given along with long-term resilient liners, compared to conventional dentures, over a period of one year after denture delivery.</p><p>Clinical implications</p><p>The results of this study have important clinical implications for prosthodontic practice. The significant improvements in MBF observed in the soft-liner group suggest that soft liners may be particularly beneficial for patients experiencing discomfort or difficulty adapting to traditional dentures. The enhanced chewing efficiency associated with soft liners can improve dietary intake and nutritional status, which is especially critical for the elderly or medically compromised individuals. Moreover, the use of soft liners may reduce the need for frequent denture adjustments and relining, thereby improving long-term patient satisfaction. As the benefits of soft liners are sustained with continued use, their long-term utility in improving denture performance and patient outcomes is advisable. However, clinicians should consider the potential drawbacks of soft liners, such as their increased susceptibility to fungal infections, degradation over time, and the need for regular maintenance. Patient education on proper care and hygiene of soft-lined dentures is essential to mitigate these risks and maximize the benefits of this intervention.</p><p>Strengths and limitations</p><p>The strengths of this study include its robust design, comparable baseline characteristics, and well-defined follow-up period. The use of objective measures, such as MBF, enhances the reliability of the findings. Additionally, the absence of loss to follow-up ensured the completeness of the data and minimized the risk of bias.</p><p>However, this study also has limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. The relatively small sample size (44 patients) may limit the generalizability of our findings to broader populations. Future studies with larger sample sizes and diverse patient groups are needed to confirm these results and to explore the effects of soft liners in different clinical contexts. Additionally, the study did not assess patient-reported outcomes such as comfort, satisfaction, and quality of life, which are critical aspects of prosthodontic care. Incorporating these measures into future research would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the benefits of soft liners. Another limitation is the relatively short follow-up period of six months. While this study demonstrated significant improvements in MBF during this period, longer-term studies are needed to evaluate the durability of these benefits and the potential effects of wear and tear on soft liners. Moreover, sex-based differences in MBF were not evaluated in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this study highlight the significant advantages of soft liners in improving&#x000a0;MBF in denture wearers. The observed improvements in MBF with soft liners at the two- and six-month follow-up periods were both statistically and clinically significant, underscoring their potential to improve dietary intake, nutritional status, and overall quality of life. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and patient-reported benefits of this intervention as well as to explore strategies for addressing potential drawbacks such as microbial colonization and material degradation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge AI tools such as ChatGPT and Paperpal for their assistance in language editing and refinement.</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
