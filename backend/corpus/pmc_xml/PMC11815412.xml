The aim of this paper is to describe the protocol for <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs Secondary</italic> in relation to implementation and scale-up across Australia, and the real-world effectiveness of the intervention on adolescents&#x02019; physical activity and sedentary time, as well as sitting time, sleep, well-being and class and school engagement.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A type II hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial will be conducted using a mixed-methods design. For the implementation trial, <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs Secondary</italic> will be disseminated via key organisations nationally (eg, state departments of education) and available to all Australian secondary schools (n=1453). Implementation outcomes will be evaluated using the RE-AIM framework (reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance). Data will be collected at the school and teacher levels via the TransformUs website (website analytics), descriptive quantitative surveys, text messages to teachers and qualitative interviews with teachers, students and representatives from key organisations. Descriptive statistics will summarise quantitative data, with regression analyses examining the associations between implementation strategies and outcomes. Implementation levels will be classified as low, moderate or high based on the extent of intervention delivery. Qualitative data will be thematically analysed.</p><p>We will assess effectiveness outcomes in 10 Victorian secondary schools using a pragmatic 1:1 waitlist control design. The target sample is 600&#x02009;Year 7&#x02013;10 students (12&#x02013;16 years). Primary outcomes include adolescents&#x02019; physical activity and sedentary time (assessed with accelerometry), and secondary outcomes include health (sleep and well-being), class and school engagement (on-task behaviour assessed via classroom observation and school attendance) and sitting time (assessed with posture monitors). Descriptive analyses will summarise students&#x02019; demographics, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and engagement, while mixed models will evaluate intervention effects on these outcomes, adjusted for confounders. Additionally, qualitative data will be thematically analysed using deductive and inductive coding in NVivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>These trials were approved by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee (2021&#x02013;269) and by the following education authorities: Australian Capital Territory Education Directorate (RES 2317), New South Wales Department of Education (2022253), Northern Territory Department of Education (20865), Victoria Department of Education (2023_004712), Queensland Department of Education (550/27/2585), South Australian Department of Education (2022&#x02013;0019), Tasmanian Department of Education (2022&#x02013;25), Western Australian Department of Education (D23/1152724), and Melbourne Archdiocese Catholic Schools (1232).

The systematic review identified strategies associated with favourable outcomes for the students (eg, physical activity, sedentary time, academic outcomes and both physical and mental health). These strategies largely aligned with those in <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> Primary, except for peer support, which was newly developed by researchers and education experts and incorporated into <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs Secondary</italic>. Participatory approach involved interviews with academics (n=8) and key educational organisations (n=4), to determine the barriers and facilitators for the programme and codesign workshops with teachers (n=10), school leader (n=1) and students (n=21). During the workshops, participants offered suggestions to customise <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs Secondary</italic> to fit their secondary school environment addressing the often neglected aspect of the school context in school physical activity intervention research.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> The <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> team further refined these adaptations that were tested in three secondary schools for feasibility in a pilot study. To facilitate scale-up, teacher professional learning sessions, support and all programme resources were adapted to be delivered online. In addition, codesign workshops (n=3) with key education and health organisations across each state and territory of Australia were held so that the programme could be contextualised according to state and territory curricula, priorities and targets.

However, using a subsample may limit generalisation as it may not fully represent the student population&#x02019;s diversity.

This approach is aligned with what was adopted in previous research<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> and involves at least one researcher to be in the classroom and routinely observing students (1:6 observer/student ratio) during a classroom lesson. The observer will look at a target consented student for 5&#x02009;s and use the remaining 10&#x02009;s to record the momentary-observed behaviour and some contextual information (ie, the student&#x02019;s movement behaviour and information on the task being conducted at the time). The same target students will be observed for four intervals (ie, 1&#x02009;min) before moving to the next student. In a 30-min observation session, each student will be observed 20 times. Observed students&#x02019; behaviours will be classified as follows: focused on-task (the student is focused on the task assigned by the teacher, eg, reading, writing, asking/answering questions, active in a purposeful way that aligns with learning intentions), passive off-task (the student is not focusing on the assigned task and shows passive disengagement, eg, not focused, daydreaming, staring, drinking water), disruptive off-task (eg, the student is not focusing on the assigned task and shows a disruptive behaviour; not focused walking around, playing with irrelevant objects, fidgeting), absent (eg, the student left the classroom). Contextual information relating to students&#x02019; movement behaviours will be classified as follows: sitting, standing, walking slow, walking fast and moving fast (eg, jumping). Information on the setting/task will be coded as follows: independent task, paired task, group task, teacher-led activity, test and other. To ensure consistency in the observation and data collection processes, an online observation tool to record students&#x02019; behaviour was developed in the Qualtrics survey by the research team (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 4F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-19-5"><title>Student attendance</title><p>Overall student attendance data will be collected for each participating school at baseline and 6&#x02009;months.

Observations will begin 5&#x02009;min into recess and 10&#x02009;min into lunch and occur every 5&#x02009;min. Research assistants will rotate clockwise around the zones, with each group starting in a different zone. Observations will end 5&#x02009;min before the end of recess/lunch. All observations will be recorded on the SOPLAY data collection sheet.

The audit tool quantifies the dimension (m<sup>2</sup>) of the school footprint and the percentage of the school grounds taken up by buildings and on-site car parking, sports courts, green spaces (eg, trees, open green spaces), playgrounds and covered areas (eg, shade sails). AISA uses an advanced artificial intelligence methodology and deep learning segmentation pipeline to quickly and accurately label the above environmental features using date-stamped satellite images of school grounds. Some additional environmental characteristics not captured by AISA will be audited in person (eg, sports or playground equipment, playground/sports courts markings, playgrounds/outdoor spaces separated by a physical barrier, aesthetics of facilities, bicycle parking).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-22"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes will be performed using Stata 18 for Windows (StataCorp LP) and RStudio V.1.4.453 (R V.3.6.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p><p>Descriptive analyses will be employed to depict the quantitative data collected for all variables of interest, including students&#x02019; demographic characteristics, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, well-being, class engagement, school environment and intervention implementation measures (eg, school audit data) at each time point.
