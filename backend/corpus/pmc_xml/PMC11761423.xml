We studied this paradox in the <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> olfactory system by establishing a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of all developing antennal sensory lineages, including latent neural populations that normally undergo programmed cell death (PCD). This atlas reveals that transcriptional control is robust, but imperfect, in defining selective sensory receptor expression. A second layer of precision is afforded by the intersection of expression of functionally-interacting receptor subunits. A third layer is defined by stereotyped PCD patterning, which masks promiscuous receptor expression in neurons fated to die and removes &#x0201c;empty&#x0201d; neurons lacking receptors. Like receptor choice, PCD is under lineage-specific transcriptional control; promiscuity in this regulation leads to previously-unappreciated heterogeneity in neuronal numbers. Thus functional precision in the mature olfactory system belies developmental noise that might facilitate the evolution of sensory pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">Sensory systems mediate detection of the environment and provide the brain with a spatio-temporal code that enables recognition, interpretation and appropriate behavioral responses to a stimulus. However, the external world of stimuli changes as species colonize new ecological niches. Thus, sensory systems must also be capable of change over evolutionary timescales.</p><p id="P6">This paradox of functional precision but evolutionary flexibility is particularly notable in the olfactory system of <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Intensive anatomical, molecular and functional analyses of the major olfactory organ, the third antennal segment (hereafter, antenna), have defined a highly stereotyped organization in which ~1200 neurons are categorized into nearly 50 distinct classes of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), as well as several types of hygrosensory and thermosensory neurons (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Benton, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Benton et al., 2025</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">McLaughlin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Schlegel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</xref>). Each class of olfactory neuron is characterized by the expression of a specific &#x0201c;tuning&#x0201d; receptor (belonging to the Odorant receptor (Or), Ionotropic receptor (Ir) or so-called &#x0201c;Gustatory&#x0201d; receptor (Gr) families), which defines chemical specificity, together with one or more broadly-expressed &#x0201c;co-receptors&#x0201d; (Orco for Ors; Ir8a, Ir25a, Ir76b for Irs). A few classes of neurons express more than one tuning receptor, typically encoded by tandemly-arranged gene duplicates. Antennal sensory neurons are grouped in combinations of 1&#x02013;4 neurons underlying sensory hairs (sensilla) of several distinct morphological classes: antennal basiconic (ab), trichoid (at), intermediate (ai) and coeloconic (ac) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The ciliated dendrites of OSNs are housed in the sensillar hair, while the axons project to the antennal lobe in the brain, where they innervate a glomerulus unique to each type of neuron.</p><p id="P7">The stereotypy is derived from apparently hard-wired developmental mechanisms. Each sensillum develops from a single sensory organ precursor (SOP) cell that is specified in the antennal imaginal disk in the larva (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The canonical view is that an SOP gives rise to a short, fixed lineage of asymmetric cell divisions that produces eight terminal cells with distinct molecular identity (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Chai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Endo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Endo et al., 2011</xref>). Four of these eight cells become support cells (which have functions in sensillum construction and secretion of perireceptor proteins (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt and Benton, 2020</xref>)), while the other four &#x02013; termed Naa, Nab, Nba or Nbb &#x02013; can potentially give rise to OSNs (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Chai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Endo et al., 2011</xref>). Although two sensillum types do contain 4 OSNs, all other sensilla house fewer neurons. This is thought to be due to programmed cell death (PCD) of precursor cells during the pupal stage (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Chai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Endo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Endo et al., 2011</xref>); in many ac lineages the Nbb precursor is thought to differentiate as a glial cell (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Endo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Rodrigues and Hummel, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Sen et al., 2005</xref>). Abundant evidence supports the contribution of OSN-specific gene regulatory networks in defining the fate of surviving neurons, notably in the precise transcriptional activation (or inhibition) of receptor genes (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Barish and Volkan, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Jafari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Mika and Benton, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Mika et al., 2021</xref>). Such deterministic transcriptional codes are thought to be central to the functional stereotypy of the olfactory system.</p><p id="P8">Comparison of the <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> olfactory system with other insects, however, reveals remarkable evolvability, with changes in receptor function, receptor expression and OSN number, often linked to adaptation of species to new ecological niches (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Hansson and Stensmyr, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Ramdya and Benton, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Zhao and McBride, 2020</xref>). For example, in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila sechellia</italic>, an extreme specialist on noni fruit, olfactory channels detecting the host fruit exhibit altered receptor tuning and expanded OSN populations (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Auer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Prieto-Godino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The generation of new receptors through tandem gene duplication and functional diversification through sequence changes are conceptually straightforward processes that are well-documented (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Croset et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Mika et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al., 2003</xref>). By contrast, how novel cell types within a sensillum might emerge is much less well-understood. One clue came from the demonstration that blocking PCD is sufficient to result in the formation of functional OSNs (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Prieto-Godino et al., 2020</xref>), implying a latent potential of OSNs fated to die in evolving as new cell types. Deeper understanding of this potential is precluded by our almost complete lack of knowledge of how PCD is patterned in the developing OSN lineages, and the molecular properties of individual neurons fated to die.</p><p id="P10">In this work, we generate a high-resolution, developmental atlas of the antennal neuronal lineages, encompassing those that become functional neurons as well as those that undergo PCD. We use this to define the first molecular determinants specifying PCD of OSNs. Notably, we also discovered previously overlooked heterogeneity in the patterning of receptor expression and PCD in the olfactory system, which suggests how it might adapt during evolution.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generation of an atlas of developing and dying antennal sensory neurons</title><p id="P11">To generate a high-resolution, comprehensive, spatio-temporal atlas of the antennal OSN lineages, we labelled these cells by using <italic toggle="yes">pebbled-Gal4</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">peb-Gal4</italic>), which is expressed in all neural lineages (as well as many non-neuronal cells) from before 18 h after puparium formation (APF) (<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Sweeney et al., 2007</xref>), to drive a nuclear-GFP reporter (<italic toggle="yes">UAS-unc84:GFP</italic>) (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Henry et al., 2012</xref>).

For both control and PCD-blocked genotypes, we dissected antennal tissues from animals sampled every 6&#x02013;8 h from 18&#x02013;80 h APF, spanning the vast majority of their development (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).

Using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform, we sequenced the transcriptomes of ~54k and ~32k nuclei from control and PCD-blocked antennae, respectively, detecting on average ~1000 genes/nucleus (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Unless mentioned otherwise (see <xref rid="S13" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> and legends), for all downstream analyses we integrated control and PCD-blocked datasets, assuming that the vast majority of cells would form equivalent clusters in these datasets, and that a smaller number of &#x0201c;undead cells&#x0201d; would potentially form clusters unique to the PCD-blocked dataset. To broadly catalog antennal cell types, we used marker genes extracted from the Fly Cell Atlas (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2022</xref>) (see <xref rid="S13" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">C</xref>). Sensory neurons &#x02013; excluding Johnston&#x02019;s organ mechanosensory neurons &#x02013; represent ~39% of cells (~21,000) in the control dataset and ~43% (~14,000 cells) in the PCD-blocked dataset (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1D</xref>), consistent with the latter containing many undead neurons (considered in more detail below). The remaining cells in our datasets mostly represent sensillar support cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1D</xref>), suggesting that <italic toggle="yes">peb-Gal4</italic> labels both neuronal and non-neuronal branches of the SOP lineages; the latter cell types can be investigated in future studies.</p><p id="P13">We first annotated neurons within these datasets by developmental phase (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>). All &#x0201c;branches&#x0201d; of cell clusters comprised a continuum through early-, mid- and late-pupal stages (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), each presumably reflecting the development of different neuronal lineages. Each phase has distinct transcriptional profiles (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>): early-pupal stage neuronal markers were enriched for genes involved in translation (likely reflecting enhanced protein synthesis capacity); mid-pupal stage neuronal markers were enriched in genes involved in signaling, cell-adhesion, axonogenesis and ion transport (concordant with the wiring of antennal neurons in the brain (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Jefferis and Hummel, 2006</xref>)); late-pupal stage neurons expressed higher levels of genes involved in ion transport and synaptic transmission (consistent with mature cell functions in neuronal signaling). Cells from mid-developmental stages appeared to be the most transcriptionally divergent between lineages, with late-stage neurons converging to a more similar gene expression profile (as noted previously (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">McLaughlin et al., 2021</xref>)) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>High-resolution annotation of the developing antennal sensory neurons</title><p id="P14">We subclustered these lineages at high resolution, annotating many clusters based on the (chemo)sensory receptor gene(s) expressed in cells of the control dataset (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>). To annotate cells from earlier developmental stages &#x02013; which mostly lack expression of a diagnostic receptor gene &#x02013; we used an iterative, retrograde annotation method (see <xref rid="S13" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). In brief, marker genes were extracted for each individual neuron cluster &#x02013; and/or groups of neurons housed in the same sensillum (&#x0201c;sensillar markers&#x0201d;) &#x02013; and used to identify and annotate additional clusters. These clusters were used as sources of additional earlier marker genes (see example iterations in <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4</xref>). Ultimately, we could annotate ~90% of neurons (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>); most of the remaining cells correspond to the earliest time points, which were difficult to distinguish transcriptionally. A subset of these early cells expresses glial markers (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3B</xref>); these might correspond to the Nbb-derived glia within the neuronal lineages (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Endo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Rodrigues and Hummel, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Sen et al., 2005</xref>). The ~19,000 annotated neurons in our control atlas represent more than 15-fold coverage of this sensory organ (~1200 neurons/antenna) (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Grabe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Schlegel et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Our annotation of sensory neurons allowed us to document the complements of cell adhesion molecules, neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels for individual neuron types (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>), substantially extending previous analyses (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">McLaughlin et al., 2021</xref>). Such information might point to additional molecules defining the specific anatomical and functional properties of different sensory channels. In the context of understanding the development of the olfactory system, we were also able to extract markers for all sensillar classes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref>), and those distinguishing the four neuron precursor types across essentially all lineages (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7</xref>).

We tested the functional relevance of TF expression through study of three very narrowly-expressed TF genes, which we reasoned might have selective and non-redundant roles: <italic toggle="yes">lozenge</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">lz</italic>), encoding an AML/Runt family TF, which is expressed exclusively in ab10 Or67a and Or85f neurons, and the tandemly-organized paralogs <italic toggle="yes">ladybird early</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">lbe</italic>) and <italic toggle="yes">ladybird late</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">lbl</italic>), encoding NK-like homeobox TFs, which are co-expressed in Or23a and Or83c neurons in ai2 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8</xref>).</p><p id="P18">In all cases TF expression precedes that of the <italic toggle="yes">Or</italic> genes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>).

We note that co-occurrence of <italic toggle="yes">Ir75a</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Ir75b</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Ir75c</italic> transcripts does not reflect co-expression of these genes, but rather runaway transcription in this cluster; protein-coding transcripts are expressed in distinct populations of OSNs (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Mika et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Prieto-Godino et al., 2017</xref>).

Whether co-receptors function in every neuron in which they are expressed is unclear. Genetic and electrophysiological analyses indicate an olfactory requirement for Ir8a only with selectively-expressed acid-sensing tuning Irs (e.g., Ir31a, Ir64a), and Ir25a/Ir76b together only with amine-sensing Irs (e.g., Ir41a, Ir76a) (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abuin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Vulpe and Menuz, 2021</xref>), despite broader expression all three of these co-receptor genes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abuin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">McLaughlin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Task et al., 2022</xref>). Loss of Ir25a has been described to affect Or neuron sensitivity to stimuli, with mild increase or decrease of responses, depending upon the neuron and the odor (<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Task et al., 2022</xref>), but the mechanistic basis for such a variable effect on Or neuron responses is unclear. To our knowledge there is only one case of a neuron (in ac3) that contains a functional complement of tuning and co-receptor Ors and Irs (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Benton et al., 2025</xref>). We suggest that contributions of broadly-expressed co-receptors is constrained by the selective expression of partner tuning subunits: just as tuning receptors without co-receptors are likely to be non-functional, co-receptors without partners might have no or minimal sensory contributions.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Heterogeneous life and death fates of specific OSN populations</title><p id="P25">We next turned our attention to the neurons that are normally removed by PCD during antennal development.

To identify cells in the atlas corresponding to those that undergo PCD, we examined the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes <italic toggle="yes">reaper</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">rpr</italic>), <italic toggle="yes">grim</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">sickle</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">skl</italic>) and <italic toggle="yes">head involution defective</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">hid</italic>) as one or more of these genes are transcriptionally upregulated prior to PCD in many developmental contexts (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Pinto-Teixeira et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

We therefore combined expression enrichment of <italic toggle="yes">rpr</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">grim</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">skl</italic> into a single &#x0201c;RGS score&#x0201d;, as a quantitative measure of the likelihood that a cell type was fated to die (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).</p><p id="P26">We next decomposed the atlas of integrated control and PCD-blocked datasets (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) into individual sensilla, using sensillar markers (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref>) and compared cells from each dataset. We reasoned that some undead neurons might form cell clusters unique to the PCD-blocked dataset, as investigated in the next section. However, as many undead neurons express receptors characteristic of normal populations of OSNs (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Prieto-Godino et al., 2020</xref>), we first asked whether any such cells are embedded in clusters of these normal cells, thereby simply creating a larger cluster in the PCD-blocked dataset. Given the highly quantitative representation of cell populations in our antennal atlas (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), to identify such undead neurons, we first compared the relative proportion of each neuronal type in control and PCD-blocked datasets (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S12C</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). While neurons housed in the same sensillum generally displayed similar representations within and across datasets (e.g., Or56a/Or33a and Or7a neurons in ab4, or Or67c and Or98a neurons in ab7, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), in several cases in the control dataset we observed different proportions of co-housed neurons. For example, in ab10 Or85f neurons are underrepresented compared to Or67a neurons, and in the trichoid sensillum at4 Or65a/b/c neurons are less abundant than Or47b and Or88a neurons (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Importantly, these mis-matched neuronal representations were at least partially re-equilibrated in the PCD-blocked atlas (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S12C</xref>), suggesting individual cell types within a subset of sensilla are developmentally lost due to death.</p><p id="P27">Focusing first on ab10, we investigated this possibility initially by comparing the pro-apoptotic gene RGS score within individual neuron lineages (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).

In agreement with these transcriptomic data, RNA FISH for these receptor transcripts revealed a lower number of Or85f neurons compared to Or67a neurons in the antenna; while all of the former are paired with the latter, we detected several cases of isolated Or67a neurons in control animals, but not when PCD was blocked (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">G</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Next, we examined at4 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>).

We suggest that such cases of PCD represent &#x0201c;collateral damage&#x0201d; resulting from the expression of Slp2 in these cells that, perhaps due to developmental noise, reaches a minimal threshold of expression to promote PCD in some but not all neurons. In line with this notion, we noticed that different wild-type strains exhibited varying degrees of Or65a/b/c neuron loss: <italic toggle="yes">w</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">1118</italic></sup> have (like our <italic toggle="yes">peb-Gal4</italic> strain) low numbers of Or65a/b/c neurons compared to Or47b neurons, Canton-S has an equal number of these two populations, while Oregon R flies have an intermediate number of Or65a/b/c neurons (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8J</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">L</xref>).

In reality, however, these properties represent just a snapshot in evolutionary time, neither precisely the same as in the past, nor necessarily maintained in the future. Understanding the nature of this snapshot in the context of a continuous process of change can offer insights into how nervous systems evolve. The insect olfactory system is a particularly attractive model for studying this phenomenon: this sensory system can be subject to strong environmental selection pressure as the bouquet of external volatile cues changes, and the typically large, rapidly reproducing populations of insect species provide the necessary genetic substrate for evolutionary modifications. Using <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> as a model, we have characterized developmental properties of OSN lineages to reveal features of this species&#x02019; olfactory system underlying its functional stereotypy, but also how these offer the potential for evolution.</p><p id="P43">Through high resolution spatio-temporal transcriptomic profiling of developing neurons, we first confirmed the expected global precision of receptor transcription in the olfactory system, typically a single tuning receptor per neuron type. However, we also reveal that this control is imperfect. We describe several examples of co-expression of tuning receptors of the same or different families. Such co-expression &#x02013; sometimes transient &#x02013; presumably reflects similarities in the gene regulatory networks controlling receptor expression in distinct neuronal classes, as suggested by the high degree of overlap in the set of TFs we found in different cell types. The promiscuity in receptor expression is constrained, nevertheless, by the necessity to have the correct complement of tuning receptor and co-receptor subunits to form a functional complex. This seemingly-ectopic expression of receptor genes does permit a degree of evolvability as it is possible that only transcriptional activation of a complementary (co)-receptor subunit is necessary to reconstitute a functional sensory receptor. However, as we have shown in two cases that artificial co-receptor expression is insufficient to reconstitute function of &#x0201c;ectopic&#x0201d; tuning receptor activity, we suspect that levels of ectopic tuning receptor might also need to be enhanced, and there are possibly other requirements for functionality, such as perireceptor proteins or morphological specializations of the neuron/sensillum.</p><p id="P44">Our atlas of PCD-blocked antennae allowed us to characterize the development of many lineages fated to die. These lineages exhibit diverse properties: the undead neurons we identified were of different precursor types within diverse sensillar classes. Some of these robustly express a tuning receptor gene; here PCD can counteract promiscuous receptor expression, serving as a further regulatory layer to ensure precision in receptor patterning in the mature sensory system. Other undead neurons lack a detectable tuning receptor; however, our detection of co-receptor transcripts even in these &#x0201c;empty&#x0201d; neurons supports the idea that broad co-receptor expression extends to cells destined to die, thereby reflecting a more amenable evolutionary substrate for subsequent re-emergence of new neuron types from such dying lineages. Why some neurons express a receptor gene and other do not is an interesting open question. One possibility is that this property reflects their evolutionary age: lineages that more recently evolved a PCD fate might retain the gene regulatory network to permit receptor expression, while evolutionarily older dying lineages might have drifted in fate thus losing the capacity to express specific tuning receptors. Whatever the reason, the absence of &#x0201c;empty&#x0201d; neurons in the extant olfactory system implies that during emergence of a new sensory pathway from a dying lineage, changes in the gene regulatory network to turn off PCD and turn on a tuning receptor must be closely coordinated.</p><p id="P45">In this context, our identification of the first TFs (Mamo and Slp2) required for specification of PCD in OSN lineages provides an important entry-point into understanding how life/death fate decisions occur and evolve. The broader expression of both of these TFs beyond lineages fated to die emphasizes their context-dependent function, presumably because they are embedded within gene regulatory networks that influence survival, death and/or differentiation of sensory lineages. Further characterization of these, and other, TFs in dying lineages will help reveal whether and how they directly control pro-apoptotic genes expression, and why they promote PCD in some lineages but not others. Such knowledge will be key to understand how patterning of PCD can change during evolution to generate or remove individual sensory neuronal populations, and how this is coordinated with the selective expression of receptors.</p><p id="P46">While several lineages are entirely condemned to death (e.g., ac3 Ir75d-expressed neurons), we found, unexpectedly, that some dying neurons represent subsets of normal surviving lineages (e.g., Or65a/b/c neurons in at4). Such heterogeneity can be interpreted in different ways. The phenomenon might be an adaptive trait, for example, to limit the numbers of just one class of neurons within a specific sensillum type. However, the variation in Or65a/b/c population size across different <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> genotypes argues against this possibility, although we cannot exclude that such intraspecific phenotypic diversity arises from local adaptation of specific strains. Alternatively, heterogeneous PCD might reflect promiscuity in transcriptional specification of PCD resulting from overlap in gene regulatory networks of surviving and dying lineages, akin to the promiscuity observed in receptor expression. In this context, the observed heterogeneity in PCD specification might reflect a transitory evolutionary state of these pathways, such as the initial stages of loss of a sensory population. In extreme cases, promiscuous PCD might result in sensilla devoid of OSNs, as observed in rare instances (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Nava Gonzales et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P47">Taken together, our work both provides new understanding of the multilevel mechanisms that define the functional precision of the <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> olfactory system and highlights previously-overlooked variability at each of these levels that might provide a substrate for the molecular and cellular changes in these sensory pathways over evolutionary timescales.
