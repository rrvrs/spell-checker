However, it was later discovered that a perforation had occurred.</p></sec><sec id="deo270017-sec-0020"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 43&#x02010;year&#x02010;old woman underwent a colonoscopy (ECL&#x02010;600ZP7; FUJIFILM) for screening at another facility without anesthesia. Her medical history was unremarkable, with no history of hemodialysis, normal platelet count, no medication use, no coagulation abnormalities, and no colonic diverticula. During the procedure, a 3 mm type 0&#x02010;Is lesion in the transverse colon was treated using CSP (CS3&#x02010;11023230; Micro&#x02010;Tec). The endoscopist who performed the procedure has 4 years of experience. The total time required for the endoscopic examination, including the procedure, was 20 min. There were no adverse events observed during the procedure, such as bleeding or perforation. After the procedure, the patient experienced no symptoms and was discharged immediately. However, two hours later, the patient reported pain that rapidly worsened and subsequently visited our emergency room. The patient complained of abdominal pain alone, without any observation of bloody stools. Upon initial assessment, her vital signs were stable with a temperature of 37.0&#x000b0;C, pulse rate of 74/min, blood pressure of 118/72 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16/min. Her body mass index was 20.7. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the right upper quadrant upon palpation with muscular defense. Laboratory studies were within normal limits except for an elevated white blood cell count of 14,000/&#x000b5;L, C&#x02010;reactive protein level of 0.075 mg/dL, and D&#x02010;dimer level of 0.88 &#x000b5;g/mL. Contrast&#x02010;enhanced computed tomography (CE&#x02010;CT) revealed a 70 mm, high&#x02010;intensity mass in the transverse colon with contrast extravasation, suggestive of a bowel wall hematoma (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270017-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Additionally, high&#x02010;attenuation ascites were observed in the abdominal cavity. The attenuation values of the ascites measured between 25.0 and 59.0 Hounsfield Units (HU). Based on these HU values, the ascites were determined to be either hemorrhagic or indicative of a blood clot. There was slight inflammation around the transverse colon, and the outer layer of the bowel in the hematoma&#x02010;forming region was not discernible. Given the indistinct outer layer of the hematoma and the presence of high attenuation ascites suggestive of hemorrhagic fluid, the possibility of the hematoma penetrating the intestinal wall was considered. However, no free air was observed, leading to the determination that there was no gastrointestinal perforation at this stage. Two hours later, the serum hemoglobin level decreased by 1.3 mg/dL, indicating active bleeding. Therefore, transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) was attempted to stop the bleeding. Although the bleeding point could not be identified on arteriography, CE&#x02010;CT suggested a peripheral branch of the middle colic artery, and TAE was performed on it. Several hours later, the anemia had not worsened, but severe abdominal pain with muscular defense persisted. A joint conference between the gastroenterology and gastrointestinal surgery departments was held. Due to the persistence of severe abdominal pain with muscular defense and the presence of high attenuation ascites suggestive of hemorrhagic fluid, the possibility of the hematoma penetrating the intestinal wall at some location was considered. Although the exact site of penetration was unclear, it was presumed to be at a location where the outer layer of the hematoma was indistinct. Consequently, an urgent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed. A huge hematoma was noted in the right transverse colon, and bloody ascites were observed within the abdominal cavity. However, no indications of contamination were detected, and no perforations were confirmed during the surgery. The surgery was successfully completed, and the patient was discharged 14 days later with satisfactory progress. Pathological examination confirmed the presence of an intramural hematoma in the proximal transverse colon with hemorrhagic infiltration of all layers, along with extensive necrotic changes. A perforation was identified in this area, and mucosal defects near the hole were observed, possibly attributed to CSP (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270017-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a&#x02013;c</xref>). Endoscopic imaging and pathological specimens of CSP were obtained from the facility where the procedure was performed and further investigated. Endoscopic imaging of the CSP revealed extensive mucosal resection but no evidence of active bleeding (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270017-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>). The CSP specimens measured 12 mm, of which the adenoma was 4 mm, and it did not contain muscularis mucosa and submucosa (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270017-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3c,d</xref>).

Other risk factors include anticoagulant therapy, bleeding diathesis, malignancies, chemotherapy, vasculitis, collagen diseases, and colonic diverticular disease. However, in this case, no such risk factors were identified. Considering the presence of a mucosal defect potentially caused by CSP within the hematoma, we classify this hematoma as a complication stemming from CSP. Despite the generally low incidence, there have been some reports of hematoma and perforation following CSP. A literature search on PubMed from inception to July 2024 yielded two case reports of hematoma,<xref rid="deo270017-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Force cold snare polypectomy is often utilized when the snared specimen cannot be resected.

</xref> According to the treating physician, force cold snare polypectomy was utilized in this case, potentially contributing to hematoma formation. Therefore, when specimens cannot be removed with CSP, the device should not be pulled indiscriminately.</p><p>While the exact cause of the perforation has not been identified, histopathological examination revealed significant ischemic changes and necrotic changes across all layers, suggesting that these changes may be the cause of the perforation. It is possible that intestinal ischemia and necrosis were induced by factors such as the enlargement of a hematoma or transarterial embolization.

</xref> It is known that bowel ischemia induced by TAE can occasionally lead to intestinal perforation. In this case, the bowel ischemia and intestinal perforation may have been caused by an enlargement of the hematoma, TAE, or a combination of these factors.</p><p>The timing of the surgery for this case was deemed appropriate. Although no contamination of the ascitic fluid was observed, the perforation meant that fecal matter could have leaked at any time. The absence of free air despite the perforation was likely due to the hematoma covering it. While conservative treatment might have been effective, if the hematoma had been absorbed without the perforation site being sealed, the fecal matter could have leaked from the perforation site, necessitating a larger surgery involving the creation of a stoma.</p><p>In conclusion, we experienced a case of gastrointestinal perforation following transarterial embolization for an intramural hematoma after a CSP of an adenoma in the transverse colon. CSP is generally a procedure with few complications; however, it can potentially result in severe complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="deo270017-sec-0050"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec id="deo270017-sec-0060"><title>ETHICS STATEMENT</title><p>Approval of the Research Protocol by an Institutional Review Board: N/A.</p></sec><sec id="deo270017-sec-0070"><p>Informed Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.</p></sec><sec id="deo270017-sec-0080"><p>Registry and the Registration No. of the Study/Trial: N/A.</p></sec><sec id="deo270017-sec-0090"><p>Animal Studies: N/A.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="deo270017-sec-0040"><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank Hidemitsu Nishizawa, MD, for his constructive suggestions.</p></ack><ref-list id="deo270017-bibl-0001"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="deo270017-bib-0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="deo270017-cit-0001">
