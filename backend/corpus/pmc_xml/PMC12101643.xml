</self-uri><abstract><p>Phosphogypsum-based cementitious materials (PGCs) typically exhibit low strength and poor toughness when utilized as construction materials. This study explores the incorporation of raw bamboo fibers of varying lengths into PGCs at different ratios to develop raw bamboo fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum-based composite materials (BFRPGCs). Firstly, the influence of the water-cement ratio on the mechanical properties of BFRPGCs was investigated through a one-factor experimental approach, leading to the identification of an optimal water-cement ratio. Secondly, the effects of the length and content of raw bamboo fibers on the mechanical properties of BFRPGCs at this optimal water-cement ratio were examined, along with an exploration of the mechanisms by which raw bamboo fibers impact the mechanical properties of the composites, considering their damage modes. Finally, the microstructure of BFRPGCs was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which elucidated the mechanisms through which raw bamboo fibers influence the working and mechanical properties of the composites. The results demonstrated that the incorporation of raw bamboo fibers significantly enhanced the mechanical strength of the specimens. Specifically, when the length of the bamboo fibers was 12&#x02009;mm and the doping amount was 1.0%, the compressive and flexural strengths of BFRPGCs reached their maxima at 28.99&#x02009;MPa and 8.41&#x02009;MPa, respectively. These values represent increases of 123.73% and 169.82% compared to the control group. Additionally, hydration-generated calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gels and calcium aluminate (AFt) phases formed a skeletal support around the CaSO&#x02084;&#x000b7;2H&#x02082;O, reinforcing the matrix structure. Furthermore, numerous hydration products adhered to the surfaces of the raw bamboo fibers, resulting in enhanced adhesion between the fibers and the matrix. This study provides valuable insights for the research and application of fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum-based building materials.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Introduction</title><p>Phosphogypsum is a byproduct generated during phosphate production, primarily composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate. The substantial accumulation of phosphogypsum, coupled with severe environmental pollution and low utilization rates, underscores the urgent need for effective recycling and reuse strategies [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As of 2024, China&#x02019;s stockpile of phosphogypsum has surpassed 600 million tons, increasing by over 80 million tons annually, with storage facilities approaching capacity [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The comprehensive utilization of phosphogypsum encompasses three main avenues: 1) its application as a construction material [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], 2) its use in agriculture [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and 3) its decomposition for sulfuric acid production, which is essential for cement co-production [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Among these, the use of phosphogypsum in construction has gained prominence, yet the inherent limitations of phosphogypsum-based building materials, characterized by poor toughness and low strength, hinder its widespread adoption in the construction sector [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>To enhance the mechanical properties of phosphogypsum and broaden its construction applications, numerous studies have been conducted globally. However, practical engineering applications face challenges: steel fibers are prone to corrosion when exposed to air [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], polypropylene (PP) fibers exhibit low tensile strength [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], polyvinyl alcohol fibers are costly [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and glass and asbestos fibers pose health hazards [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In contrast, plant fibers are natural polymer materials with specific chemical compositions [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], drawing significant attention due to their safety, availability, biodegradability, and potential for sustainable regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Among these, bamboo fiber&#x02014;a rapidly renewable plant fiber&#x02014;exhibits mechanical properties comparable to traditional fiber-reinforced cement, significantly enhancing the toughness of composite cementitious materials [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Moreover, bamboo fibre-reinforced phosphogypsum has been demonstrated to exhibit distinct advantages over conventional fibre-reinforced materials with regard to environmental friendliness, resource and sustainability, and compatibility with biodegradable materials.</p><p>Current research on bamboo fibers focuses on their application as a substitute for traditional fiber-reinforced geopolymers and cementitious materials. For instance, Correia et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] demonstrated that bamboo fibers could effectively reinforce cement, resulting in mechanical properties similar to those of conventional fiber-reinforced composites. Zhou et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] introduced a novel bamboo fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum composite wall, highlighting the synergistic benefits of raw bamboo and phosphogypsum for green building applications. Bala et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] explored bamboo reinforcement in concrete, finding that an admixture of approximately 4% bamboo significantly improved the material&#x02019;s strength and toughness while minimizing cracking. Liu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] developed a stress-strain principal model for raw bamboo and phosphogypsum, proposing a calculation method for the load-bearing capacity of combined short columns, supported by experiments involving bamboo cylinders filled with phosphogypsum and finite element analysis. While bamboo is widely utilized in the construction industry, its composite products with gypsum are largely limited to gypsum walls, panels, and bricks. Consequently, there is a notable lack of research on raw bamboo fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum-based composite cementitious materials. Exploring the potential of raw bamboo fibers to reinforce phosphogypsum cementitious materials could significantly improve the overall utilization rate of phosphogypsum.</p><p>In this study, we prepared raw bamboo fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum-based composite materials (BFRPGCs) by blending raw bamboo fibers with phosphogypsum-based cementitious materials to optimize the properties of these composites. A one-way experimental design was employed to investigate the effect of the water-cement ratio on BFRPGCs, identifying the optimal ratio for enhanced performance. Under this optimal water-cement ratio, we analyzed the effects of fiber length, doping amount, and their interactions on composite properties. Additionally, the microscopic characteristics of bamboo fibers within phosphogypsum-based building materials were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the mechanisms by which bamboo fibers influence the properties of phosphogypsum-based composites were explored. This research aims to provide valuable insights for the development and application of fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum-based building materials.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2.

Phosphogypsum-based cementitious materials.</title><p>The principal raw materials employed in this experiment included phosphogypsum, cement, silica fume, quicklime, and a water-reducing agent. Phosphogypsum was sourced from Guizhou Kaifu Phosphogypsum Comprehensive Utilization Co., while the cement utilized was ordinary silicate cement (P.O. 42.5) produced by Guiyang Conch Panjiang Cement Plant. Silica fume, primarily composed of SiO&#x02082;, was obtained from Henan Gongyi Baichuan Environmental Protection Engineering Co., Ltd. Quicklime, containing over 97% active CaO, was procured from Sichuan Yibin Sichuan Fume Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Additionally, the polycarboxylic acid water-reducing agent was purchased from Shanghai Chenqi Chemical Technology Co. Both primary phosphogypsum (DPG) and hemihydrate phosphogypsum (HPG) were utilized in this study. The preparation method was as follows: the phosphogypsum was crushed, naturally dried, and sieved to obtain DPG. This DPG was then calcined in an oven at 160 &#x000b0;C for 2 hours, followed by a sealing process for natural aging over 7 days to yield HPG [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. <xref rid="pone.0323011.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> illustrates the X-ray diffractograms of the two types of phosphogypsum, while <xref rid="pone.0323011.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the chemical composition of the principal raw materials.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0323011.t001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323011.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Detailed chemical composition of raw materials.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323011.t001" id="pone.0323011.t001g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Materials</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SO<sub>3</sub></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CaO</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SiO<sub>2</sub></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MgO</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">K<sub>2</sub>O</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DPG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.009</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43.869</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.863</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.878</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.564</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.315</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.036</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.078</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HPG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.163</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">42.033</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.709</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.918</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.471</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.294</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.017</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.074</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cement</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.962</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.713</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.897</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.169</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.456</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.155</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.725</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.196</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Silica fume</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.316</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.130</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">96.030</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.011</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.078</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.280</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.107</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.191</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Quicklime</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.263</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">97.231</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.448</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.003</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.132</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.139</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.902</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.030</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="pone.0323011.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323011.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>XRD pattern of DPG, HPG.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323011.g001" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>2.1.2.

Experimental design.</title><p>In the pre-experiment, we observed that when the water-cement ratio was below 0.25, the workability of PGCs was poor and difficult to handle. On the other hand, when the water-cement ratio exceeded 0.45, the strength of PGCs decreased. Based on these findings, we conducted a one-factor experiment with water-cement ratio as the influencing factor, ranging from 0.25 to 0.45. The optimal water-cement ratio of 0.275 was determined, with raw bamboo fiber length fixed at 8&#x02009;mm and doping amount at 1.0%. The initial experiment employed a one-way design, focusing primarily on the water-cement ratio. The optimal water-cement ratio of 0.275 was determined while maintaining the length of the raw bamboo fibers at 8&#x02009;mm and the dosage at 1.0 wt %. Following this, the effects of fiber length and dosage on the mechanical properties of bamboo fiber-reinforced polymer concrete (BFRPGCs) were investigated. The lengths of the raw bamboo fibers were 4&#x02009;mm, 8&#x02009;mm, 12&#x02009;mm, and 16&#x02009;mm, with the fiber dosage for each length set at four levels: 0, 0.50, 1.0, and 1.5 wt%. The experimental design is summarized in <xref rid="pone.0323011.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. In this study, samples were labeled according to the length and dosage of the raw bamboo fibers.

Effect of water-cement ratio on mechanical properties of BFRPGCs</title><p><xref rid="pone.0323011.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> illustrates the effect of the water-cement ratio on the compressive strength of bamboo fiber-reinforced polymer concrete (BFRPGCs). As shown in the figure, the 7-day and 28-day compressive strengths of BFRPGCs gradually decrease as the water-cement ratio increases from 0.250 to 0.450. At a water-cement ratio of 0.250, the 7-day compressive strength is 19.02&#x02009;MPa, and the 28-day compressive strength is 27.08&#x02009;MPa, representing the maximum values. In contrast, at a water-cement ratio of 0.450, the 7-day compressive strength drops to 1.66&#x02009;MPa, and the 28-day compressive strength decreases to 2.41&#x02009;MPa, indicating the minimum values. Increasing the water-cement ratio provides an adequate water environment for the hydration process of phosphogypsum-based cementitious materials, allowing the hydration reaction to proceed smoothly. However, excessive water can lead to issues such as water secretion and delamination of the material during the hardening process [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These phenomena compromise the internal structure of the matrix, leading to the formation of defects such as cracks and voids. Additionally, the evaporation of excess water creates more pores, resulting in increased porosity as the water-cement ratio continues to rise. This leads to a less dense internal cementation of the specimen and causes stress concentration when subjected to pressure, which is macroscopically manifested as a reduction in compressive strength.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0323011.g003"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323011.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Effect of water-cement ratio on compressive strength of BFRPGCs.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323011.g003" position="float"/></fig><p><xref rid="pone.0323011.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> demonstrates the influence of the water-cement ratio on the flexural strength of BFRPGCs. The data indicate that the flexural strengths at both 7 days and 28 days decrease progressively as the water-cement ratio increases from 0.250 to 0.450. Specifically, at a water-cement ratio of 0.250, the 7-day flexural strength reaches 6.71&#x02009;MPa, while the 28-day flexural strength peaks at 8.05&#x02009;MPa, representing the highest values recorded. In contrast, at a water-cement ratio of 0.450, the 7-day flexural strength falls to 1.54&#x02009;MPa, and the 28-day strength declines to 1.85&#x02009;MPa, marking the lowest values observed. As the water-cement ratio increases, the higher water content leads to a greater retention of free water during the hardening process of phosphorite-based cementitious materials. The evaporation of this free water results in pore formation, which subsequently increases the material&#x02019;s porosity. An increase in porosity compromises the internal structure of the phosphogypsum matrix, leading to a reduction in density. Consequently, the specimens become more prone to fracture under external loads. Additionally, the increase in porosity, combined with a more heterogeneous distribution of voids, weakens the bonding strength within the phosphogypsum matrix. This further enhances the material&#x02019;s vulnerability to fracture when subjected to bending moments.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0323011.g004"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323011.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Effect of water-cement ratio on flexural strength of BFRPGCs.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323011.g004" position="float"/></fig><p>In addition, the experiments revealed a delamination phenomenon in the bamboo fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum composite cementitious material when the water-cement ratio exceeded 0.325. At a water-cement ratio of 0.250, the formation of this composite material was hindered, leading to a tendency for bamboo fibers to agglomerate. Consequently, it is essential to maintain a moderately high water-cement ratio to prevent low strength and delamination while ensuring that it is not too low to avoid mixing difficulties. Although the compressive strength at 7 days and 28 days for a water-cement ratio of 0.275 was found to be 3.36% and 6.87% lower, respectively, than that at a water-cement ratio of 0.250, the flexural strength at 7 days and 28 days was observed to be 2.39% and 2.36% lower than at the lower ratio.

However, once the water-cement ratio exceeds 0.300, a significant decline in both compressive and flexural strengths is noted. Thus, the optimal water-cement ratio for the bamboo fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum composite cementitious material is determined to be 0.275.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>3.2.

Without the addition of bamboo fibers, the 7-day and 28-day flexural strengths of PGCs were 4.31&#x02009;MPa and 4.95&#x02009;MPa, respectively. After the incorporation of bamboo fibers, the flexural strength of BFRPGCs gradually increased with the increase in fiber content, while the length of the bamboo fibers remained constant. In terms of 7-day flexural strength, it was observed that for a bamboo fiber length of 16&#x02009;mm, the flexural strength of the specimens declined as the dosage increased. For the 28-day flexural strength, when the fiber length exceeded 8&#x02009;mm, the specimens exhibited an initial increase in flexural strength followed by a decrease with rising dosage. Upon determining the optimal dosage of bamboo fibers, it was found that both the 7-day and 28-day flexural strengths of BFRPGCs initially increased before declining with longer bamboo fiber lengths. Notably, for a low dosage of 0.5%, the 7-day flexural strength of the specimens increased with longer fibers, although this trend was not particularly pronounced. For specimens with a bamboo fiber length of 12&#x02009;mm, the 7-day flexural strength peaked at 7.07&#x02009;MPa with a doping level of 1.5%, representing a 64.04% increase compared to the control group. For the 28-day flexural strength in specimens with a bamboo fiber length of 12&#x02009;mm, the maximum value reached 8.41&#x02009;MPa at a dosage of 1.0%, corresponding to a 69.90% increase relative to the control group. When the length of bamboo fibers exceeds 12&#x02009;mm, the flexural strength of the samples decreases as the content increases. For the specimen with a bamboo fiber content of 1.5%, the flexural strength at 7 days and 28 days were 5.75&#x02009;MPa and 6.62&#x02009;MPa, respectively, which represent reductions of 18.67% and 21.28% compared to the maximum group. In conclusion, the incorporation of bamboo fibers has been shown to enhance the flexural strength of the specimens, with the optimal performance observed when the length of the bamboo fibers is 12&#x02009;mm.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0323011.g005"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323011.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Variation of flexural strength of BFRPGCs.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323011.g005" position="float"/></fig><p>As illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0323011.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, increasing both the length and the doping of bamboo fibers enhances the flexural strength of bamboo fiber reinforced glass composites (BFRGCs). This improvement is attributed to the longer fibers, which, when the specimen is subjected to a bending load, reinforce the bonding capacity within the matrix [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Additionally, higher fiber doping increases the number of interfaces, further contributing to this effect. However, it was observed that when the length of the bamboo fibers exceeded 12&#x02009;mm, there was no significant enhancement in the flexural strength of the specimens at 7 and 28 days, despite the effects of fiber doping and length. This lack of improvement may result from the uneven distribution of fibers within the matrix, which can lead to defects caused by the increased fiber length and doping [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This observation aligns with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], that concluded that the enhancement of the flexural properties of gypsum materials by fibers is primarily due to mechanical occlusion, interfacial adhesion, and cohesion between the fibers and the matrix. Moreover, a densely formed fiber-matrix interfacial transition zone (ITZ) is established between the fibers and the matrix. The superior tensile strength and fracture toughness of bamboo fibers enable a robust interface that effectively resists internal tensile stresses and absorbs substantial energy, thereby minimizing internal damage and cracking. Additionally, cracks that span the BFRGCs can serve as load bridges, enhancing the stress field within the matrix and significantly improving the overall toughness of the material [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>3.2.2. Effect of bamboo fiber on compressive strength of BFRPGCs.</title><p><xref rid="pone.0323011.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> illustrates the relationship between the compressive strength of Bamboo Fiber Reinforced Geopolymer Composites (BFRPGCs), the length of bamboo fibers, and the amount of doping. Without the addition of bamboo fibers, the 7-day and 28-day compressive strengths of PGCs were 16.20&#x02009;MPa and 23.43&#x02009;MPa, respectively. After the addition of bamboo fibers, the 7-day compressive strength of BFRPGCs increased gradually with the increase in fiber content, provided that the length of the bamboo fibers remained unchanged and did not exceed 12&#x02009;mm. However, when the fiber length is increased to 16&#x02009;mm, a decline in compressive strength occurs with the addition of doping. For the 28-day compressive strength of BFRPGCs, a similar trend is observed. When the fiber length is less than 12&#x02009;mm, compressive strength increases steadily with higher doping levels. Beyond this length, the compressive strength of the specimens initially increases and then decreases with increasing doping amounts. Once the bamboo fiber dosage is set, both the 7-day and 28-day compressive strengths of BFRPGCs demonstrate a pattern of initial increase followed by a decrease as the fiber length increases. Notably, for a lower dosage of 0.5%, the compressive strengths at both 7 days and 28 days show a gradual increase with longer fibers, although this trend is less pronounced. As depicted in <xref rid="pone.0323011.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>, with a fixed bamboo fiber length of 12&#x02009;mm and a doping level of 1.5%, the 7-day compressive strength reached a maximum of 19.35&#x02009;MPa, representing a 19.44% increase compared to the control group. In specimens with a bamboo fiber length of 12&#x02009;mm, the highest compressive strength for those with 1.0% doping was recorded at 28 days, achieving 28.99&#x02009;MPa, which is a 23.73% increase over the control group. When the length of bamboo fibers exceeds 12&#x02009;mm, the flexural strength of the samples first increases and then decreases with the increase in content. For the specimen with a bamboo fiber content of 1.5%, the compressive strength at 7 days and 28 days were 16.62&#x02009;MPa and 23.42&#x02009;MPa, respectively, which represent reductions of 14.11% and 19.21% compared to the maximum group. In conclusion, the addition of bamboo fibers significantly enhances the compressive strength of the specimens. The optimal compressive strength is achieved with bamboo fiber lengths of 12&#x02009;mm. This enhancement can be attributed to the fibers&#x02019; ability to restrict crack propagation and increase porosity [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, if porosity increases beyond the capacity to limit crack growth, the compressive strength will decrease. Conversely, a manageable increase in porosity, while effectively limiting crack extension, can improve compressive strength [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0323011.g006"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323011.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Variation of compressive strength of BFRPGCs.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323011.g006" position="float"/></fig><p><xref rid="pone.0323011.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> illustrates that the capacity of long fibers to enhance the compressive strength of the matrix is significantly greater than that of short fibers. This difference arises primarily from the fact that short fibers contribute to a suboptimal pore structure, which can result in considerable adverse stress. In contrast, the incorporation of long fibers leads to a more effective hoop effect, enhancing the overall integrity of the matrix. However, it is important to note that excessive fiber length may lead to uneven mixing and the formation of agglomerates, which can concentrate local stresses within the matrix. This concentration can influence the damage mode of the specimen and adversely affect overall compression performance [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Additionally, <xref rid="pone.0323011.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> indicates that the ability of bamboo fibers to enhance the compressive strength of the matrix is not easily discernible at low dosages. Moreover, the compressive strength of the specimen is significantly reduced when the dosage is excessively high and prolonged. This reduction is primarily due to the fact that fiber over-dispersion at lower dosages is more prone to creating unfavorable pressure conditions. Conversely, an excessive quantity of fibers, especially when both numerous and lengthy, can lead to poor dispersion and the formation of agglomerates, ultimately increasing the porosity of the matrix [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>3.3. Destruction patterns of BFRPGCs</title><p><xref rid="pone.0323011.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7(a)</xref> illustrates the flexural strength failure of the specimens. Upon applying the load, the control group specimens exhibited the formation of penetrating cracks at their midpoint. This phenomenon can be attributed to the presence of voids within the phosphogypsum matrix. As the loading increased, the cracks propagated from the bottom upwards until the bond within the phosphogypsum matrix could no longer withstand the additional stress, resulting in specimen failure. The incorporation of bamboo fibers resulted in a random distribution of fibers that provided support to the gypsum matrix. Upon the formation of cracks, the bamboo fibers within the phosphogypsum matrix facilitated a &#x0201c;bridging effect,&#x0201d; effectively constraining the propagation of crack growth and enhancing the flexural strength of the specimens. This transformation reflects a shift in damage behavior from brittle to ductile in phosphogypsum cementitious materials (PGCs) to bamboo fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum cementitious materials (BFRPGCs). Upon reaching the maximum maximum load capacity, the samples in the blank group underwent brittle damage and sudden fracture, while the samples with added bamboo fibers underwent continuation damage and initiated the process of cracking [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This change is attributed to the bonding network established by the bamboo fibers, which enhances the continuity of the matrix, allowing for more effective regulation of crack width. Furthermore, as depicted in <xref rid="pone.0323011.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7(a)</xref>, the majority of the observed cracks exhibit an oblique curvature, which can be explained by the extension of cracks along the porous zones. When subjected to bending loads, the upper load-bearing region of the specimen experiences compression, while the area between the two lower load-bearing points is subjected to tensile stresses. The integration of bamboo fibers into phosphogypsum-based composite cementitious materials enhances their tensile modulus, resulting in anisotropic behavior and improved tensile capacity in the lower portion of the matrix.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0323011.g007"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323011.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Damage pattern of the specimen.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323011.g007" position="float"/></fig><p><xref rid="pone.0323011.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7(b)</xref> illustrates the damage morphology of phosphogypsum composites (PGCs) and bamboo fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum composites (BFRPGCs) under vertical pressure. The results indicate that samples without added bamboo fibers exhibit fractures and partial spalling. When the pores within the phosphogypsum matrix experience longitudinal compression, stress concentration occurs, leading to the formation of transverse cracks that gradually penetrate the material. As the load continues to increase, these cracks extend outward, ultimately compromising the integrity of the specimens once they breach the surface. In contrast, the specimens containing bamboo fibers demonstrate a different fracture behavior, characterized by vertical cracking primarily at the edges of the compression zone. The incorporation of fibers allows the samples to undergo longitudinal compression while being supported transversely by the bridging effect of the bamboo fibers. This reinforcement significantly mitigates the propagation of cracks in the longitudinal direction. Upon reaching the ultimate load, the decrease in load is minimal, and the specimens exhibit a &#x0201c;failure without separation&#x0201d; behavior.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>3.4.

Furthermore, in the control samples, a multitude of pores is evident in <xref rid="pone.0323011.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref> (a), resulting from the extensive spaces between the massive calcium sulfate dihydrate crystals and the expansion of the hydration products (e.g., AFt).

As illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0323011.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7(b)</xref>, the hydration products are firmly attached to the surfaces of the bamboo fibers. This strong adhesion can be attributed to two factors: the large specific surface area and rough texture of the bamboo fibers [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], as previously discussed, along with the fibers&#x02019; favorable hydrophilicity [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], which enables them to absorb and retain a portion of the free water, facilitating the precipitation of hydration products on their surfaces.</p><p><xref rid="pone.0323011.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref> presents the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of bamboo fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum composites (BFRPGCs) with varying degrees of bamboo fiber doping. Hardened phosphogypsum is characterized as a porous material; consequently, the interior of the phosphogypsum composites contains numerous pores when no fibers are incorporated, as illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0323011.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9(a)</xref>. The introduction of bamboo fibers enhances the hydrophilicity of the composite, promoting a more effective integration with the phosphogypsum matrix and resulting in an increased internal density in the resulting BFRPGCs. <xref rid="pone.0323011.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref> further illustrates that when the amount of bamboo fibers is insufficient, they fail to disperse thoroughly and uniformly within the gypsum matrix, leading to greater distances between the fibers (<xref rid="pone.0323011.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9(b)</xref>). In contrast, with a moderate bamboo fiber content, the fibers are evenly distributed throughout the matrix without entanglement or agglomeration, as demonstrated in <xref rid="pone.0323011.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9(c)</xref>. However, at high bamboo fiber concentrations, the dispersion capacity of the fibers within the matrix becomes inadequate, resulting in tendencies to cross, tangle, and agglomerate, yielding an uneven distribution (refer to <xref rid="pone.0323011.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9(d)</xref>). The hydrophilicity of bamboo fibers facilitates the precipitation and crystallization of calcium sulfate dihydrate on their surfaces, which enhances adhesion between the fibers and the phosphogypsum matrix. This interaction results in a more compact internal structure of the BFRPGCs, thereby improving the bridging effect of the fibers [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Consequently, additional doping with bamboo fibers is required to address the voids and imperfections present within the specimen. Conversely, excessive doping leads to agglomeration, characterized by comparatively minimal phosphogypsum content in these irregularly distributed zones. Moreover, the surfaces of the fibers exhibit a reduced quantity of hydration products, which ultimately diminishes matrix density and compromises the strength of the BFRPGCs.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0323011.g009"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323011.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>SEM images of BFRPGCs specimens at different doping levels.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323011.g009" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>3.5. Mechanism of mechanical properties strengthening of BFEPGCs</title><p>The model of bamboo fiber reinforced phosphogypsum composites (BFRPGCs) with varying bamboo fiber lengths at a constant dosage is illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0323011.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>. The incorporation of short bamboo fibers facilitates a degree of bridging; however, their limited length leads to rapid displacement following crack formation within the BFRPGCs (see <xref rid="pone.0323011.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref> (a)). As a result, the observed enhancement in strength is relatively modest. In contrast, with the increase in bamboo fiber length, the bonding between the fibers and the phosphogypsum matrix becomes more robust, effectively preventing fiber pullout and crack propagation, thereby enhancing strength (<xref rid="pone.0323011.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref> (b)). Nevertheless, as the length of the bamboo fibers continues to increase, their dispersion ability within the slurry becomes increasingly constrained, leading to an uneven distribution characterized by clumps, tangles, and intersections (as illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0323011.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref> (c)). Upon hardening of the slurry, this uneven distribution of phosphogypsum in these areas generates stress concentration points, ultimately diminishing the strength of the specimens. Moreover, if the length of the bamboo fibers is insufficient to reach the critical length, the phosphogypsum matrix may be incapable of effectively transferring load to the fibers, resulting in a reduction in the flexural strength of the specimens. When the length of the bamboo fibers is moderate and meets the critical length, they can effectively share the load and provide adequate deformation capacity, thereby significantly enhancing the flexural strength of the specimens [<xref rid="pone.0323011.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0323011.g010"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323011.g010</object-id><label>Fig 10</label><caption><title>Model of BFRPGCs with different bamboo fiber lengths at the same doping level.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323011.g010" position="float"/></fig><p>The model of bamboo fiber reinforced polymer composites (BFRPCs) with different bamboo fiber doping of the same length can be found in <xref rid="pone.0323011.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>.

As the amount of doping increases, the bamboo fibers become more evenly distributed throughout the matrix (see <xref rid="pone.0323011.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11(b)</xref>). This results in a stronger bond between the fibers and the matrix, which enhances the material&#x02019;s overall strength. When the bamboo fiber doping is excessive, the bamboo fibers exhibit inadequate dispersion within the slurry, resulting in cross-links, tangles, and an uneven distribution (<xref rid="pone.0323011.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11(c)</xref>). It increases the number of pores and defects within the matrix, significantly reducing the material&#x02019;s strength. It can thus be concluded that the addition of moderate amounts of bamboo fibers to the matrix results in the uniform attachment of hydration products to the surface of the fibers.

Challenges and prospects</title><p>Although this study demonstrated the positive effects of raw bamboo fibers on the properties of phosphogypsum-based cementitious materials, a critical challenge remains in translating these results from laboratory conditions to practical industrial applications, especially with regard to ensuring uniform fiber dispersion. Experimentally, we have improved fiber dispersion by optimizing the fiber pretreatment processes (e.g., drying, artificial dispersion, etc.). However, under industrial-scale production conditions, achieving uniform fiber distribution remains a significant challenge. Therefore, future research should focus on the use of efficient mixing technologies, such as high-shear mixers or ultrasonic dispersing equipment, to further improve fiber dispersion and distribution uniformity. Additionally, given the natural characteristics of raw bamboo fibers, their hydrophilicity and hygroscopicity may impact the large-scale production process. As such, further process optimization is essential for future work.

<named-content content-type="author-response-date">3 Jan 2025</named-content>
</p><p>Responses to reviewers' comments</p><p>Dear Editors and Reviewers,</p><p>Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers' comments concerning our revised manuscript entitled "Mechanical properties of raw bamboo fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum-based composite cementitious materials and their strengthening mechanism" (PONE-D-24-56170). Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our researches. We have studied comments carefully and have made correction which we hope to meet with approval. Revised portion is marked in red in the paper. The main corrections in the paper and the response to their viewer's comments are as flowing:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1. Comment: While the paper highlights the potential of bamboo fibers for reinforcing phosphogypsum, the novelty should be better articulated by comparing results with existing materials like polypropylene or steel fibers.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your careful review and valuable comments on the paper. Firstly, as noted in the introduction, I acknowledge that the list of adverse effects associated with various contemporary fibres, such as polypropylene and steel fibres, may not be exhaustive. To address this, a further comparison will be made between the performance of bamboo fibre and polypropylene fibre and steel fibre in terms of different performance indexes, as illustrated in a table:</p><p>Table 1</p><p>Performance of bamboo fibre with polypropylene fibre, steel fibre and polyvinyl alcohol fibre on different performance indicators</p><p>Performance indicators Bamboo fibres Polypropylene fibres Steel fibres Polyvinyl alcohol fibres</p><p>Mechanical performance High tensile strength, good toughness, enhanced material crack resistance Lower tensile strength for improved material resistance to cracking Superior tensile strength to increase the overall strength of the material Good tensile properties, but weak compared to steel fibres</p><p>Environmental benefit Renewable Energy, biodegradable, low carbon footprint Petroleum-based material, non-degradable, negative impact on the environment High energy consumption, difficult recycling, higher carbon emissions Environmentally friendly materials, biodegradable, low carbon footprint</p><p>Cost effectiveness Low-cost, resourceful and particularly suited to large-scale production Medium cost, widely used but costly in the long term High cost, higher production and transport costs Higher production costs, especially in large-scale utilisation</p><p>References Zhang et al. (2020), Liu et al. (2021) Silva et al. (2018), Mahmood et al. (2020) Li et al. (2017), Mohamed et al. (2019) Zhang et al. (2022), Chen et al. (2020)</p><p>Secondly, within the ambit of the 'bamboo instead of plastic' research, the utilisation of bamboo fibre-reinforced phosphogypsum, as an emerging building material, has the potential to amalgamate the environmental properties of phosphogypsum with the elevated strength of bamboo fibres. In comparison to conventional polypropylene and steel fibre reinforcements, bamboo fibre-reinforced phosphogypsum exhibits distinctive advantages in terms of environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, and compatibility with biodegradable materials. In response to your suggestion, we will further clarify and mark in red the introductory paragraph, which will be reworked as follows:</p><p>To enhance the mechanical properties of phosphogypsum and broaden its construction applications, numerous studies have been conducted globally. However, practical engineering applications face challenges: steel fibers are prone to corrosion when exposed to air [18, 19], polypropylene (PP) fibers exhibit low tensile strength [20, 21], polyvinyl alcohol fibers are costly [22, 23], and glass and asbestos fibers pose health hazards [24, 25]. In contrast, plant fibers are natural polymer materials with specific chemical compositions [26, 27], drawing significant attention due to their safety, availability, biodegradability, and potential for sustainable regeneration [28-30]. Among these, bamboo fiber&#x02014;a rapidly renewable plant fiber&#x02014;exhibits mechanical properties comparable to traditional fiber-reinforced cement, significantly enhancing the toughness of composite cementitious materials [31, 32]. Moreover, bamboo fibre-reinforced phosphogypsum has been demonstrated to exhibit distinct advantages over conventional fibre-reinforced materials with regard to environmental friendliness, resource and sustainability, and compatibility with biodegradable materials.</p><p>2. Comment: The selection of the optimal bamboo fiber length (12 mm) and doping amount (1.0%) lacks a clear explanation of whether other combinations might provide comparable or better results.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your careful review. Regarding your question &#x0201c;The selection of the optimal bamboo fiber length (12 mm) and doping amount (1.0%) lacks a clear explanation of whether other combinations might provide comparable or better results.&#x0201d; we have revisited the experimental design and provided an explanation.</p><p>In the experiment, the variation in length of bamboo fibre was set at 4mm, 8mm, 12mm, and 16mm, with the fibre amount for each length set at four levels (0, 0.50, 1.0, 1.5wt%), as evidenced by the experimental results:</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->1&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; --> A bamboo fibre length of 12 mm has been shown to optimise the properties of the composite while maintaining adequate mechanical strength and stability. The addition of longer bamboo fibres (16 mm) has been found to enhance the strength to a certain extent, however, it has also been observed to affect the dispersion of the fibres and the homogeneity of the material. In contrast, shorter fibres (4 mm) have been found to be ineffective in providing the desired reinforcing effect of bamboo fibres. Consequently, the 12 mm length is regarded as a balanced choice.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->2&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; --> At a doping level of 1.0 wt%, the bamboo fibres were found to enhance the mechanical properties of the composites to a significant extent, without exerting an excessive negative impact on the processing properties of the materials. Conversely, higher (1.5 wt%) or lower (0.50 wt%) doping levels resulted in a decline in mechanical properties.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->3&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; --> Following the experimental study, it was determined that the optimal mechanical properties of BFRGCs were attained with a bamboo fibre length of 12 mm and a doping level of 1.0 wt%, as illustrated below:</p><p>Fig. 5. Variation of flexural strength of BFRPGCs.</p><p>Fig. 6. Variation of compressive strength of BFRPGCs.</p><p>3. Comment: The one-way experimental design is appropriate but limits the exploration of interactions between parameters. A factorial design could provide deeper insights.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your careful review and valuable comments on our work. We appreciate your suggestions regarding the experimental design. We agree with your observation that &#x0201c;the one-way experimental design is appropriate but limits the exploration of interactions between parameters, and a factorial design could provide deeper insights.&#x0201d; Due to time and resource constraints in the current study, we chose a one-factor experimental design to focus on the effects of bamboo fiber length and dosage on the mechanical properties of phosphogypsum-based cementitious materials. This limited our ability to perform ANOVA or explore interactions between parameters. We understand that a factorial design would offer a more comprehensive understanding, particularly in terms of multi-parameter interactions. We apologize for not being able to implement a factorial design in this study. However, in future research, we plan to expand the experimental design to incorporate a factorial approach, which will allow us to better explore the interactions among factors and conduct the relevant statistical analyses. This will provide deeper insights into the combined effects of individual parameters on the experimental results.</p><p>4. Comment: The study does not mention the use of statistical tools to validate the significance of observed trends in mechanical properties. Adding ANOVA or regression analysis could strengthen the reliability of findings.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your careful review of our study. We greatly appreciate your questions regarding the statistical analysis tools (e.g., ANOVA and regression analysis). We fully recognize the value of these methods in verifying the significance of trends in mechanical properties and in enhancing the reliability of the study. In the current study, statistical methods such as analysis of variance (ANOVA) or regression analysis were not employed because our experimental design was based on a one-way approach, focusing primarily on the effect of each individual variable (such as the length of raw bamboo fibers or the amount of blending) on the mechanical properties. Although we performed multiple repetitions in our experiments and observed relatively consistent trends across the experimental groups, which led us to believe that the results were reliable, we did not use statistical tools to quantify the significance of these trends.</p><p>We apologize for this omission and fully acknowledge the importance of your suggestions in further enhancing the rigor and credibility of our study. For future research, we plan to adopt more comprehensive experimental designs, including multifactorial and factorial approaches, which will enable us to apply statistical tools (such as ANOVA and regression analysis) to validate the significance of the results and strengthen the overall credibility of our findings.</p><p>Once again, we are grateful for your valuable comments, which have provided crucial direction for the improvement of our future research. We will incorporate your suggestions into our experimental design and ensure that appropriate statistical analyses are conducted in future studies. We look forward to receiving your guidance again in the future.</p><p>5. Comment: The mechanical properties of control specimens are referenced but not thoroughly analyzed to demonstrate the incremental benefits of bamboo fibers.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We appreciate your identification of the issues related to the analysis of the mechanical property control samples. We agree that this section requires further discussion to better highlight the positive effect of bamboo fibers. In the current study, while we did mention the mechanical properties of the control (blank) samples, the primary focus was on evaluating the impact of bamboo fibers on the mechanical properties of phosphogypsum-based cementitious materials. As a result, our description of the control samples was relatively brief. We now recognize that a more detailed analysis of the matrix strength without the addition of bamboo fibers is crucial to more clearly demonstrate the benefits provided by the bamboo fibers. We apologize for this omission and will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the control samples in the revised version.</p><p>Specifically, we will include a detailed data analysis of the control samples, focusing on mechanical property indices, and compare these with the samples containing bamboo fibers to better illustrate the gain effect of the bamboo fibers. This will not only make the results more thorough and persuasive, but will also clarify the actual contribution of bamboo fibers to the material properties.</p><p>Once again, we greatly appreciate your insightful comments. We have added the necessary analyses to the manuscript, and these additions are highlighted in red. The revised sections are provided below:</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->1&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; --> Fig. 5 illustrates the variation in flexural strength of bamboo fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum composites (BFRPGCs) as a function of bamboo fiber length and doping amount. Without the addition of bamboo fibers, the 7-day and 28-day flexural strengths of PGCs were 4.31 MPa and 4.95 MPa, respectively. After the incorporation of bamboo fibers, the flexural strength of BFRPGCs gradually increased with the increase in fiber content, while the length of the bamboo fibers remained constant.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->2&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; --> Fig. 6 illustrates the relationship between the compressive strength of Bamboo Fiber Reinforced Geopolymer Composites (BFRPGCs), the length of bamboo fibers, and the amount of doping. Without the addition of bamboo fibers, the 7-day and 28-day compressive strengths of PGCs were 16.20 MPa and 23.43 MPa, respectively. After the addition of bamboo fibers, the 7-day compressive strength of BFRPGCs increased gradually with the increase in fiber content, provided that the length of the bamboo fibers remained unchanged and did not exceed 12 mm.</p><p>6. Comment: The SEM analysis is informative but would benefit from quantitative metrics, such as porosity measurements or fiber-matrix adhesion strength, to substantiate qualitative observations.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your valuable comment. We greatly appreciate your suggestion to incorporate quantitative metrics into the SEM analysis. While SEM images provide important qualitative information, we agree that including quantitative analyses (e.g., porosity measurements or quantification of fiber-matrix bond strength) would enhance the credibility of our findings and better support our observations. In this study, the SEM analysis focused on examining the microscopic morphology of the samples and describing the fiber-matrix interface. However, due to the limitations of the experimental design, we did not conduct quantitative measurements of porosity or fiber-matrix bond strength. We apologize for this limitation and recognize that your suggestions are essential for improving the rigor of our study.</p><p>As you pointed out, porosity is an important factor influencing the mechanical and adhesive properties of the phosphogypsum matrix. In future studies, we plan to extend our analysis by incorporating porosity measurements, tests of fiber-matrix bond strength, and other relevant quantitative metrics. These additional analyses will allow us to validate the trends observed in the SEM images more comprehensively and further strengthen the reliability of our conclusions.</p><p>Thank you again for your professional guidance. We have revisited the paper and made improvements to the SEM images. The revised version, with changes marked in red, is shown in the figure below:</p><p>Fig. 9. SEM images of BFRPGCs specimens at different doping levels.</p><p>7. Comment: The long-term performance and durability of BFRPGCs under environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, freeze-thaw cycles) are not addressed, which is critical for construction materials.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your valuable comments. We take your question regarding the long-term performance and durability of bamboo fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum-based cementitious materials (BFRPGCs) under environmental conditions (e.g., humidity, freeze-thaw cycles, etc.) very seriously. We fully agree that these factors are critical for the practical application of building materials.</p><p>In the current study, we only conducted short-term performance tests, primarily focusing on a 28-day curing period. The main objective of these experiments was to evaluate the initial impact of bamboo fibers on the mechanical properties of phosphogypsum-based cementitious materials and to provide a preliminary assessment of the material's performance. Due to the limitations of the experimental design, we did not address long-term durability aspects (e.g., freeze-thaw cycles, humidity effects, etc.) or environmental adaptability in depth. We apologize for this limitation and fully understand your concerns regarding the long-term performance and durability of the material. These factors are indeed crucial for the practical use of building materials, especially in varying environmental conditions. As such, we plan to extend our future research to include long-term durability testing, specifically focusing on the performance of BFRPGCs under the influence of humidity, freeze-thaw cycles, and other environmental factors. These follow-up experiments will allow us to more comprehensively assess the long-term stability and durability of bamboo fiber-reinforced phosphogypsum-based materials and provide stronger support for their practical application in engineering projects. In addition, we intend to adopt standardized durability testing methods (e.g., freeze-thaw cycles, hot and humid enviro</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0323011.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323011.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0323011.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323011.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Oyebisi</surname><given-names>Solomon</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Solomon Oyebisi</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Solomon Oyebisi</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0323011" id="rel-obj004" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
