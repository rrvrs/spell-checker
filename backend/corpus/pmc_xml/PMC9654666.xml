The purpose of this study is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of ceRNAs in HCC. Methods: This study detects potential ceRNAs from HCC through whole genome analysis of lncRNA, miRNA and mRNA expression. We then performed high-throughput sequencing of tissues from five hepatitis B related HCC patients to screen ceRNAs and those screened ceRNAs expressions were verified on tissues from an independent group of six patients. Finally, the function of ceRNAs of interest was illustrated in vitro. Result: Functional and pathway analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed ceRNA networks. The high-throughput sequencing identified 985 upregulated and 1612 downregulated lncRNAs and 887 upregulated and 1116 downregulated mRNAs in HCC patients. Differentially expressed genes were parallel to cancer-associated processes, comprising 18 upregulated and 35 downregulated significantly enriched pathways including alcoholism and viral carcinogenesis. Among them, a potential ceRNA network was detected and verified in six HCC patients. CeRNAs of the lncRNA MAGI2-AS3/miR-374-5p/FOXO1 pathway were significantly dysregulated in HCC, and validation in vitro showed that FOXO1 is positively regulated by MAGI2-AS3 through the induction of miR-374a/b-5p in HCC cells. In addition, the overexpression of FOXO1 is associated with proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells and increases apoptosis of HCC cells. MiR-374a/b-5p caused an opposite effect by directly suppressing FOXO1 in HCC cells. Conclusion: CeRNA networks were found in HCC and aberrantly expressed ceRNAs of lncRNA MAGI2-AS3/miR-374-5p/FOXO1 plays a crucial role in HCC, assisting in diagnosis and providing a method for treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics analysis</kwd><kwd>ceRNAs</kwd><kwd>lncRNA MAGI2-AS3/miR-374-5p/FOXO1 network</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Key Research and Development Program of China</funding-source><award-id>2021YFA1100500</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>92159202</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Key Program, National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>81930016</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Zhejiang Provincial Health Science and Technology Plan</funding-source><award-id>2022RC058</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2021YFA1100500), the Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 92159202), the Key Program, National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81930016), and the Zhejiang Provincial Health Science and Technology Plan (No. 2022RC058).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-cells-11-03466"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become one of the most common types of neoplasms in the world, with a high mortality rate [<xref rid="B1-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and alcoholic liver disease. HCC has a high incidence in developing countries, especially in east Asia, and it has the second highest incidence and mortality among malignant tumors in adult male patients in China [<xref rid="B2-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Studies have shown that HCC progression is caused by abnormal genetic mutations [<xref rid="B3-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, serum markers such as alpha fetoprotein (AFP) [<xref rid="B4-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] have inhibitory effects for playing a role in the early detection of HCC, due to its lack of specificity and sensitivity. The diagnosis of HCC still depends on radiology and biopsy at the early stage of the disease. However, radiology and biopsy are known to have limited sensitivity. Therefore, we should attach great importance to understand the development of HCC and its growth mechanisms and then promote the effectiveness of the diagnosis and treatment regimens.</p><p>Recent studies which use microarray technologies and bioinformatics analysis have revealed that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), especially long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), participate in many biological and pathological processes [<xref rid="B5-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This approach can help to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) which related to the development and progression of HCC. LncRNA is a long non-coding transcript containing 2 to 100,000 nucleotides and has been shown to have various post-transcriptional and translational regulatory functions in living cells [<xref rid="B6-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, lncRNA has been reported to affect many aspects of cellular homeostasis [<xref rid="B7-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]), including proliferation [<xref rid="B9-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], apoptosis, migration, and gene stability [<xref rid="B10-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Some functional lncRNAs are tumor specific and may effect the biological function of tumor cells [<xref rid="B11-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and generate tumor-specific lncRNA biomarkers [<xref rid="B12-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma database (TCGA-LIHC) was used to screen DEGs and construct a ceRNA network. Microarray technologies and bioinformatics analysis were used to verify the related DEGs and microRNA pairs (mRNA/lncRNA) in HCC tissues. Finally, the function of ceRNAs of interest was illustrated in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-cells-11-03466"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-cells-11-03466"><title>2.1.

Gene Ontology and Pathway Analyses</title><p>In the analysis of the cellular component, the nuclear chromosomal part and the chromatin and chromosomal regions were the three most important component processes associated with elevated mRNA, and the three most important component processes associated with mRNA depletion were the extracellular matrix, the side of the membrane, and the external side of the plasma membrane. In molecular function analysis, protein heterodimerization activity, chromatin binding, and DNA catalytic activity were the three main functions in elevated mRNA levels, whereas cofactor binding, tetrapyrrole binding, and heme binding were the three most significant functions of downregulated mRNAs. In the biological process analysis, DNA conformation change, nuclear division, and eDNA packaging were the three most significant processes associated with elevated mRNA; the organic acid biosynthetic process, the carboxylic acid biosynthetic process, and the fatty acid metabolic process were the three most significant processes among downregulated mRNAs (<xref rid="cells-11-03466-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="cells-11-03466-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). A pathway analysis identified 18 upregulated and 35 downregulated mRNA target gene pathways, respectively (<xref rid="cells-11-03466-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The alcoholism, viral carcinogenesis, DNA replication, and cell cycle enrichment pathways in upregulated mRNA were important in the occurrence of HCC.

We found that miR-374a/b-5p had a high expression in HCC tissue (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and lncRNA MAGI2-AS3 had low expression in HCC tissue (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). mRNA had low expression (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), including FOXO1, ErbB receptor feedback inhibitor 1 (ERRFI1), and Carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2). The lncRNA MAGI2-AS3/miR374-5p/FOXO1 network was screened for further experimental validation because it was in line with expectations. StarBase v2.0 suggested that MAGI2-AS3 had binding sites that interacted with miR-374a/b-5p. Our results indicated that the miR-374a/b-5p mimics can reduce the luciferase activity of MAGI2-AS3-wt, but didn&#x02019;t affect MAGI2-AS3-mut (Figure. 7A). In addition, StarBase v2.0 predicted that FOXO1 might interact with miR-374a/b-5p, and the luciferase reporter showed that miR-374a/b-5p mimics could reduce the luciferase activity of wild-type FOXO1 (<xref rid="cells-11-03466-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). QRT-PCR and western blot results showed that miR-374a/b-5p expression decreased and FOXO1 expression increased when MAGI2-AS3 was overexpressed in HepG2 cells (<xref rid="cells-11-03466-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C) and miR-374a/b-5p expression increased and FOXO1 expression decreased when MAGI2-AS3 was suppressed (<xref rid="cells-11-03466-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-cells-11-03466"><title>3.5. CeRNA Effector FOXO1 Regulates Proliferation, Migration, Invasion, and Apoptosis In Vitro</title><p>In order to explore the biological function of FOXO1 on HepG2 cells, we constructed an overexpression lentiviral vector of FOXO1 and designed siRNA to reduce the expression of FOXO1.. QRT-PCR and western blot showed that the expression of FOXO1 mRNA and protein was significantly upregulated in HepG2 cells with the overexpression of FOXO1 (<xref rid="cells-11-03466-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>A,B).

The results of colony test showed that the OD450nm of HepG2 cells overexpressing FOXO1 decreased significantly, indicating that cell proliferation was inhibited (<xref rid="cells-11-03466-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>C), while knocking down FOXO1 increased the viability of HepG2 cells (<xref rid="cells-11-03466-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>I).

Meanwhile, knocking down FOXO1 showed the opposite effect; si-FOXO1 increased migration and invasion ability compared with the NC group (<xref rid="cells-11-03466-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>K,L). We then repeated those experiments in the LM3 cell line and found a similar result (<xref rid="cells-11-03466-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>).

Discussion</title><p>HCC is a heterogeneous disease, with different histopathological features and clinical behavior between different subtypes. LncRNA was receiving increasing attention to cancer due to its abnormal expression among numerous molecules which were shown to play a role in HCC.</p><p>In the present study, we provided novel targets among the many as yet uncharacterized lncRNAs and performed an analysis to identify potential key genes correlated with HCC. Indeed, the 2597 significantly differentially expressed (f &#x02265; 1.0-fold change) lncRNAs and 2003 mRNAs contained abundant information worthy of further study.</p><p>GO analysis provided a shortcut to describe the characteristics of gene products along with functional annotation data such as cell part, cellular process, and catalytic activity. Alcoholism and metabolic pathways were significantly enriched in the KEGG terms. We found that the significantly enriched terms derived from KEGG analysis agreed with the GO results. Among the GO enrichments and KEGG pathways, cell- and metabolic-related pathways appear to play vital roles in HCC carcinogenesis and progression.</p><p>The R package GDCRNATools (version 1.4.1) used in this study was applied to the TCGA-LIHC cohort to decipher relevant lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA pairs to construct a potential ceRNA network. A bioinformatics analysis identified potential key genes related to the occurrence and development of HCC, and then PCR verification found that genes such as FOXO1, ERRFI1 and CA2 had low expression in HCC tissue, indicating that these genes might play key roles in the occurrence and development of HCC. ERRFI1 is currently recognized as an immediate early response gene. The product of the ERRFI1 gene was readily induced by a variety of extracellular and intracellular stimuli [<xref rid="B13-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. ERRFI1 was located on chromosome 1p36 in humans and a locus that has long been thought to contain many putative tumor suppressor genes, and was frequently altered in many cancers including HCC [<xref rid="B14-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. CA2 was an isoform of the CA family, and the protein encoded by the gene was one of several co-acting enzymes of carbonic anhydrase and played an important role in the reversible hydration&#x02013;dehydration of carbon dioxide. This gene had been found to encode two transcript variants of different isoforms. The role of CA2 in cancer depended on the type of tumor. For example, if CA2 is overexpressed, it could be used as a powerful biomarker for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal matrix tumors (GIST) [<xref rid="B15-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, CA2 inhibited the growth of cancer cells in colorectal cancer [<xref rid="B16-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In bladder cancer, CA2 promoted tumor growth [<xref rid="B17-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, current research shows that CA2 expression is downregulated in HCC tissue and was associated with HCC growth and metastasis [<xref rid="B18-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was determined by bioinformatics and microarray and verified the results by qRT-PCR of HCC tissues. MAGI2-AS3/miRNA-374-5p/FOXO1 was in line with our expectation among those network, so we continued to study the lncRNA MAGI2-AS3/miRNA-374-5p/mRNA FOXO1 pathway. Even though part of the ceRNA of lncRNA MAGI2-AS3-miRNA-374-5p has been verified by related studies in HCC [<xref rid="B19-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we researched the regulatory axis from other perspectives. The signaling axis of miR-374a/FOXO1 was first verified in ovarian cancer, and miR-374a was found to modulate FOXO1 to control the proliferation in ovarian cancer cells [<xref rid="B20-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. FOXO1 is an important transcription factor in insulin signaling and an important repressor in PI3K/Akt signaling, which regulates various biological processes, such as cell cycle, cell differentiation, tumorigenesis, and oxidative stress responses [<xref rid="B21-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this study, we investigated the role of this pathway in HCC and found that it could regulate biological behaviors such as the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of HCC cells.</p><p>It was first time we confirmed that MAGI2-AS3 could modulate FOXO1 expression and miR-374a/b-5p play a tumor-promoting role by modulating FOXO1 in HCC. FOXO1 is a tumor-suppressing factor that inhibits carcinogenesis [<xref rid="B22-cells-11-03466" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Disruption of FOXO1 level/activity promoted carcinogenesis. MiR-374a/b-5p could bind to FOXO1 and negatively regulated its expression, which resulted in promoting carcinogenesis in HCC.</p><p>In our study, we found that the ceRNAs expressed in HCC tissue were significantly different compared to para-carcinoma tissue. However, the role of these genes in HCC is not clear now. With regard to a subsequent pathway, studies should be focused on the differentially expressed ceRNAs. Our study revealed a novel molecular mechanism of HCC cells caused by the lncMAGI2-AS3/miR-374-5p/FOXO1 pathway in vitro. Further investigations are required to deeply understand this complex mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-cells-11-03466"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Our bioinformatics analysis identifies a range of lncRNAs and mRNAs, which included the differential expression in HCC and para-carcinoma tissues. These DEGs constructed a ceRNA network and provided novel targets for studying HCC pathways and mechanisms, as well as new targets for developing diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-374a-5p and miR-374b-5p negatively regulate FOXO1 expression to modulate the biological behavior of HCC cells. These new findings showed that miR-374a/b-5p could be effective targets for the treatment of HCC.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-cells-11-03466"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following supporting information can be downloaded at: <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/cells11213466/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/cells11213466/s1</uri>, Figure S1: Heatmap top 700 to explore the significant expression of lncRNAs, Figure S2: Heatmap top 700 to assess the significant expression of mRNAs, Figure S3: the lncRNA and mRNA co-expression network.
