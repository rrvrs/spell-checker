The most researched role was in patients with achalasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], where the botulinum toxin is applied into the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The level of evidence in the non-achalasia esophageal motility disorders is somewhat scarce. The landmark study by Vanuytsel et al. confirmed the effect of botulinum toxin injected in the esophageal body in the improvement of dysphagia and reversal of weight loss one month after the application in patients with distal esophageal spasm (DES) and hypercontractile esophagus (HE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Conversely, botulinum toxin did not show any superior role to saline injection regarding non cardiac chest pain, heartburn, and regurgitation. Here we present a case report describing the endoscopic ultrasound-navigated application of botulinum toxin in severely symptomatic patient with unclassified esophageal motility disorder. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of EUS navigation of botulinum toxin application into the esophagus in its motility disorder.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Case report</title><p id="Par6">We state that subject of this case report gave written informed consent to publish her case, including publication of images. A 56-year-old female patient was recommended for evaluation to our tertiary center/motility laboratory due to dysphagia for solids and liquids, non-cardiac chest pain related to eating that had been lasting for 4&#x000a0;months and regurgitation with no effect of proton pump inhibitors. No weight loss was reported. Eckardt score was 8. Her past medical history included arterial hypertension, alcohol use disorder, and depressive disorder. Her medical history included proton pump inhibitors, hypotensive medication, venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and alprazolam<bold>.</bold> Importantly, the patient reported no opiate use. High-resolution manometry (HRM) showed normal LES integrated relaxation pressure (IRP 10.4&#x000a0;mmHg), signs of propulsive peristalsis and no panesophageal pressurization (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), however, it revealed a 7&#x000a0;cm long spastic segment extending from 23 to 30&#x000a0;cm from the nostrils (maximum pressure of 322&#x000a0;mmHg during the motility study within this segment), elevated distal contractile interval (DCI, maximum of 7762&#x000a0;mmHg in a single swallow, mean value 5482&#x000a0;mmHg). The spastic segment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was in manometric study clear in 80% of 5&#x000a0;ml swallows in the upright position. Distal latency (DL) was normal (8.9&#x000a0;s). Neither achalasia, nor any other spastic motility disorder could have been confirmed. The barium swallow study showed free passing of the contrast agent into the stomach. Due to inconclusive results, we proceeded to contrast CT scan that revealed esophageal wall thickening of 8&#x000a0;mm in the proximal part (maximal thickness of 15&#x000a0;mm) corresponding to the spastic segment revealed by HRM. While performing investigations, we administered nitroglycerine 15&#x000a0;min. before main dishes as an empirical therapy with limited symptomatic effect. We performed upper endoscopy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) that revealed no narrowing of the lumen however there was pseudodiverticular dilatation of esophageal lumen and tertiary spasms below. We repeated HRM to exclude the development of achalasia or Jackhammer esophagus, but its finding was almost unchanged, (IRP slightly elevated&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;18.8&#x000a0;mmHg with signs of propulsive peristalsis, spastic segment still present, mean DCI 2903&#x000a0;mmHg and DL 8.6&#x000a0;s).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>HRM study from the first visit of patient, where the relaxation pressure of lower esophageal sphincter was in physiological range (IRP 10,4&#x000a0;mmHg) with a 7&#x000a0;cm long spastic segment from 23 to 30&#x000a0;cm from nostrils</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12328_2024_2066_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Upper endoscopy with no stenosis of the lumen and pseudodiverticular dilatation in the upper third of the esophagus, 2 arrows point at spastic segment and a star points at pseudodiverticulum</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12328_2024_2066_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par7">Considering high symptom burden and not yet classifiable motility disorder we decided to apply botulinum toxin into the esophageal body. To secure its strict application into the bounded segment of thickened muscle layer of the esophagus (that was believed to be the major cause of symptoms) we decided to use EUS (endoscopic ultrasound) navigation. Because of the EUS probe compression, the submucosal and mucosal layer are visible only as a&#x000a0;thin hyperechogenic and hypoechogenic lines between probe and muscularis propria (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). After localizing the thickened part of the esophageal wall (20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;cm from front teeth according to the EUS), we applied botulinum toxin into 4 quadrants at the level of 24&#x000a0;cm from front teeth (muscularis propria layer thickness 8.8&#x000a0;mm) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and 20&#x000a0;cm from front teeth (muscularis propria layer thickness 4.9&#x000a0;mm). Botox Allergan (Allergan Pharmaceuticals Ireland) was dissolved in 8&#x000a0;ml of sterile saline solution, resulting in 12.5&#x000a0;IU/1&#x000a0;ml for the single application.&#x000a0;Indeed, EUS-FNI (endoscopic ultrasound&#x02013;fine needle injection) technology was employed with the use of the Olympus MAJ-67 needle. At the checkup 3&#x000a0;weeks after the procedure the patient reported improvement of symptoms and restoration of propulsive peristalsis on HRM with total elimination of spastic segment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The Eckardt score was 3. Gradual worsening of symptoms occurred 2&#x000a0;years after botulinum toxin injection, with Eckhardt score 8 (03/2021). The COVID-19 pandemic postponed scheduled visits of the patient and as late as in 05/2022 during another follow-up visit HRM revealed features fulfilling the diagnosis of II type achalasia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), with panesophageal pressurization in 40% of swallows, IRP was 21&#x000a0;mmHg. As the diagnosis of achalasia based on the HR manometry image was clear, we did not further confirm it with esophagogram and proposed peroral endoscopic myotomy to the patient.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>EUS image of thickened muscular layer of the upper third of the esophagus, white two-sided arrow points at muscularis propria, white arrow points at mucosal and submucosal layer represented by hyperechogenic and hypoechogenic line between the muscularis propria and the probe</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12328_2024_2066_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig><fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>HRM study 3&#x000a0;weeks after the botulinum toxin application and restoration of the propulsive peristalsis, normal LES relaxation pressure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12328_2024_2066_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig><fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>HRM image with panesophageal pressurization and elevated LES relaxation pressure suggesting type II.

Its time-limited effect has been demonstrated in multiple studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This restricted its utilization for elderly and/or comorbid patients in whom no requirement for anesthesia and low incidence of undesirable effects outnumbers the transient effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In achalasia, it is applied into the LES region, while in distal esophageal spasm and Jackhammer esophagus it is injected into the esophageal body. For all above mentioned indications, botulinum toxin is applied endoscopically into the muscularis propria layer.</p><p id="Par10">Some significant landmarks in the area of botulinum toxin utilization in esophageal motility disorders could be highlighted based on our case. From the motility point of view, the possibility to apply botulinum toxin in a disorder with spastic component that is not yet classified according to the Chicago classification. Although one might argue that during the second visit of the patient the manometric finding was esophageal outflow obstruction, we considered the spasm in the mid esophagus more relevant for the symptoms, and therefore, a&#x000a0;target for therapy. Significant symptom improvement further supports our approach. From the clinical point of view, there is the potential to expand the indications for the use of botulinum toxin not only in elderly comorbid patients, but also for younger subjects with yet unspecified motility defect. As it is shown by the natural course of the disease, this approach led to substantial symptom improvement until the motility disorder developed into achalasia.</p><p id="Par11">Last but not least, our case points out the possibility of significantly more precise EUS navigation of botulinum toxin application rather than more common endoscopic navigation. Although the use of EUS is in the esophagus, it has been mostly indicated for sampling lymph nodes or metastases in neoplastic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. EUS-guided tissue acquisition (TA) using fine needle aspiration (FNA) or fine needle biopsy (FNB) has been also widely used for subepithelial lesions (originating in the submucosa or muscularis propria) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We took the advantage of the fact that the muscle layer was significantly thickened in our patient in the level of the spastic segment (similarly to thickened muscle at the level of the lower esophageal sphincter in patients with achalasia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Our approach might prevent complications (e. g. mediastinitis due to paraesophageal application) not only in unclassified motility disorders, but also patients with distal esophageal spasm or Jackhammer esophagus that are more commonly indicated for botulinum toxin application.</p><p id="Par12">The relief of symptoms of our patient was considerable. Importantly, the effect was also confirmed by HRM with complete (although transient) elimination of the spastic segment that limits the possibility of the placebo effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par13">We suggest that in selected cases botulinum toxin injection might be used in motility disorders outside the Chicago classification, possibly with EUS navigation securing accurate application. This approach allows to gain time while the motility disorder is not yet developed.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>The manuscript has been read and approved by all the authors and it has not been published in another journal.
