To combat this pest, growers use various methods including insecticide sprays, biological control, and sanitation practices. However, these methods are becoming increasingly ineffective against <italic>D. suzukii</italic> due to increased resistance against insecticides and increasing labor costs. Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) has been used successfully to control many agricultural pests, but the use of irradiation, sex sorting, and the requirement to scale these insects make it costly to implement. pgSIT (precision guided Sterile Insect Technique) is a novel and efficient way to generate sterile males through genetic engineering and overcomes the drawbacks of traditional SIT. pgSIT has been implemented in multiple Dipteran insects, including <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, and has been shown to suppress wild insect populations. To further characterize sterile pgSIT males, we evaluated their fertility capacity, lack of mature sperm, and ability to induce a mating refractory period in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> wildtype females. In this study, we found that pgSIT sterile males do not produce mature sperm and can induce a refractory mating period in wildtype females. Furthermore, sperm DNA is not detected in the reproductive tracts of pgSIT-mated female reproductive tracts. These findings further support the penetrance of the pgSIT technology in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and provide further supporting data to governing regulatory bodies in their evaluation of this technology.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-88598-w.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Molecular engineering</kwd><kwd>Genetics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Agragene Inc.</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Spotted wing drosophila (<italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic>, SWD) is a significant invasive species, originating from eastern and southeastern Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. It was first spotted in North America and Europe in the late 2000s and their geographic spread has only increased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, unlike other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, are considered crop pests due to their attraction to fresh fruits rather than overripe, rotting fruits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Many soft-skinned agricultural crops such as strawberries, cherries, and raspberries are affected by <italic>D. suzukii</italic> females equipped with large, serrated ovipositors which enable them to lay eggs in the fresh fruits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. This allows the eggs to develop into larvae which feed on the fruits, causing them to become damaged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The fruit penetrating ovipositor can also lead the punctured fruits to be more susceptible to other insects, fungi, and bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These damaged fruits result in decreased crop yields and economic loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Management of this pest is key to addressing the economic losses growers face. Often, a combined approach using different strategies, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), is deployed. Common IPM approaches include cultural practices (i.e. pruning, mass trapping, fruit removal and sanitation), biological practices (i.e. nematodes, microorganisms, parasitoids), and chemical practices (conventional and organic insecticides)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Despite all these practices, growers rely on synthetic chemicals to reduce SWD populations. Although very effective at killing SWD, insecticides are broad spectrum and affect non-target insects including pollinators. Growers are faced with using multiple spray applications to combat this pest, but insecticide resistance develops after repeated exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Coupled with the high reproductive rates and short generation time of SWD, evolution against insecticides arises rapidly. Growers are now moving towards using more environmentally friendly practices due to the increasing demands for cleaner environments and safe food. Therefore, growers need novel and effective tools for managing SWD.</p><p id="Par5">The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is an effective pest control tool which relies on the use of sterile insects for the management or suppression of target insect pests. SIT has been used for over 70 years and it is responsible for successful eradication programs of some agricultural pests including the screw-worm fly (<italic>Cochliomyia hominivorax</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, Mediterranean fruit fly (<italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, tsetse fly (<italic>Glossina austeni</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and the Mexican fruit fly (<italic>Anastrepha ludens</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Implementing SIT requires mass rearing of the target insect, sex-sorting, and complete sterilization by irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The levels of radiation must be high enough to sterilize the insect, but not severely impact survival and ability to mate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. To overcome irradiation-associated fitness costs, multiple releases of these sterile insects must be performed to achieve population suppression. Despite the numerous successful SIT programs, SIT can be expensive to implement depending on the insect target. For example, SIT is challenging to implement in Lepidopteran pests because of the holokinetic structure of their chromosome that makes them resistant to radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In these Lepidopteran insects, the irradiated parents, which are partially sterile, produce completely sterile F1 offspring. This characteristic adds on to the operational costs of mass-rearing Lepidopteran sterile males. In other insect targets like Tephritids, the USDA-APHIS determined that an Oriental Fruit Fly SIT program costs outweigh the benefits in reducing eradication. Costs associated with operating the Hawaii rearing facility and Califonia eclosion facility, labor, shipping, and releases made the program expensive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This is one of the reasons why governments often sponsor and maintain these short term SIT eradication programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. These costs make it difficult for governments and private companies to establish/maintain SIT programs for pest management.</p><p id="Par6">Recently, pgSIT (precision-guided Sterile Insect Technique) has been developed to overcome the costs and drawbacks of traditional SIT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This novel form of SIT uses CRISPR-based gene editing to simultaneously disrupt genes essential for female viability and male fertility to result in the production of sterile males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. A simple genetic cross is required between the Cas9 and guide-RNA (gRNA) breeding lines to produce completely sterile males. No female offspring result after this cross and thus skips the costly sex sorting step prior to release. Both Cas9 and gRNA breeding lines scale separately and are only mated together when sterile males need to be produced&#x02014;a binary system providing a level of control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This technology has been demonstrated in several insects and provide little to no fitness cost on the breeding lines as well as the sterile male itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. pgSIT is a powerful technology that can be implemented in an IPM strategy for the control of agricultural pests. To date, this technology is characterized as a &#x0201c;biopesticide&#x0201d; and regulated as a pesticide by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) and as a &#x0201c;plant pest&#x0201d; by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Before pgSIT can be registered in the U.S., a rigorous evaluation process by both agencies must take place to assess the risk of using a biotechnology product to protect agricultural crops.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we seek to further dissect the sterility phenotype of the pgSIT sterile males in SWD for the small fruit industry stakeholders and U.S. regulating agencies. Here, we demonstrate a lack of genetic material passed on from pgSIT males to wildtype females after mating and the subsequent induced refractory mating period. We find no negative fitness costs associated with fertility in the Cas9 and gRNA breeding lines, further lending support to the scalability of this technology and a critical component in SIT programs. These findings provide insight into the unique aspects of pgSIT for insect population control and demonstrate that pgSIT SWD males behave like wildtype SWD males in terms of inducing mating responses in mated females. The data produced in this study will help regulatory bodies assess the potential risk of using pgSIT as a viable control method for suppressing SWD and other pest populations while minimizing the environmental footprint of pest control measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Generation of completely sterile <italic>D. suzukii</italic> males</title><p id="Par9">To assess the fertility of <italic>vas</italic>Cas9, gRNA<sup>sxl, &#x003b2;tub</sup>, pgSIT, and wildtype adult males, males from each strain were independently mated with virgin wildtype females and resulting offspring were counted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C).

To assess if pgSIT males could induce a refractory mating period in wildtype females, a series of mating crosses were performed, and the resulting offspring were counted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Throughout the duration of this experiment, the negative control (virgin wildtype females only) produced no offspring (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). The positive control (wildtype males paired with wildtype females) produced offspring throughout the experiment.</p><p id="Par13">Throughout the experiment, Treatment 1 (wildtype males switched to pgSIT males) experienced an increase in the average number of offspring between days 10 and day 13 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). After day 13, Treatment 1 experienced a downward trend until the experiment stopped at day 19. The pgSIT males in Treatment 2 (pgSIT males switched to wildtype males) induced refractoriness in wildtype females after the initial 7-day mating period. The average number of offspring went from 0 to 5, a slight increase in comparison to the offspring averages from Treatment 1 and the positive control (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). This clearly demonstrates a delay in the number of offspring produced when wildtype females initially mate with sterile pgSIT males. Treatments 1 and 2 increased offspring production after the second mating period (day 10) while the positive control decreased offspring production. After the third mating period (day 13), Treatment 1 experienced a downward trend in production of offspring.

Moreover, the EPA has been granted authority to set tolerances for these products which further ensures there is a &#x0201c;reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide residue.&#x0201d; To register and commercialize a biopesticide, the EPA and USDA must complete comprehensive and rigorous assessments of the product by utilizing existing and newly generated data&#x02014;for example, toxicology studies, in vitro digestibility studies, non-target organism evaluations, persistence studies, and physicochemical measurements&#x02013;as well as information from the literature. Additional (or less) information may also need to be submitted to the various agencies for a given product based on the modified fly&#x02019;s unique risk profile and related characteristics. Lastly, it is of paramount importance to fully assess and demonstrate the efficacy of the product through a series of confined and open release evaluations in the field as part of the product development process.</p><p id="Par23">To conduct field trials and obtain commercial registration in the U.S., regulatory approval must be granted from U.S. regulatory agencies including the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA). Fully characterizing the modified flies and ensuring there is complete penetrance of the desired sterility trait amongst released pgSIT males is critical to evaluating efficacy and ensuring release of these novel flies does not present a environmental safety concern. Therefore, in this study, we sought to understand the sterility phenotype of the pgSIT sterile males in SWD for SWD pest control. The efficacy of pgSIT depends on the penetrance of the male sterility and female lethality phenotype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). Consistent with previous pgSIT work in Drosophilds and mosquitoes, our study demonstrated 100% male sterility in pgSIT SWD males and complete female lethality in the F1 offspring of gRNA<sup>sxl, &#x003b2;tub</sup> and <italic>vas</italic>Cas9 parents. When examined independently, the breeding lines have comparable fertility to wildtype flies, suggesting no fitness cost is incurred in fertility in the breeding lines. This will allow for rapid expansion of the breeding lines for pgSIT sterile male production. In addition to confirming the sterility penetrance, we found that the pgSIT sterile males can induce a refractory mating period in their wildtype mates. Insect females can undergo a refractory mating period where they do not mate again for a period of time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The efficacy of pest control using SIT methods depend on the sexual competitiveness of the mass-reared males. Since pgSIT is a novel version of SIT, the in-field efficacy of this technology will also depend on the sexual competitiveness of the gene edited sterile males. Understanding whether the mated female undergoes a period of no mating after the initial mating (refractory mating period) is an important consideration for SIT programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The refractory mating period induced by pgSIT SWD males suggests that these males can induce these normal mating behaviors in females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Our data clearly demonstrates a delay in the number of offspring produced when wildtype females initially mate with sterile pgSIT males (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). In addition, a downward trend in the production of offspring is seen in wildtype females (initially mated with wildtype males) as they mate with the pgSIT sterile males throughout the duration of the experiment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). This data can be used to inform on release frequency to achieve maximum efficacy in the field.</p><p id="Par24">An examination of dissected ovaries from mated females did not yield any obvious differences amongst the treatments. In preliminary dissections (data not shown here), ovaries dissected five days post mating with pgSIT males resulted in large bundles of oocytes. We hypothesized that these females were undergoing the hormonal and physiological changes post-mating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, in the current study we were unable to see these post-mating characteristics in the dissected oocytes. This could be due to the timing of dissections. It is likely the mated females laid eggs before the dissections occurred and thus appeared to have less oocytes bundled in each ovary. Indeed, we did detect more mature oocytes in the samples from females mated to <italic>vas</italic>Cas9 and gRNA<sup>sxl, &#x003b2;tub</sup> males compared to the pgSIT mated female ovaries. This likely suggest fertile males were able to transfer sperm and induce egg production in mated females. In the virgin dissections, oocytes were present in the ovaries despite the lack of males in this treatment. It is well known that virgin <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> females will lay a small number of unfertilized eggs and represents the initial prerequisite for the evolution of parthenogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the wildtype ovaries from the pgSIT 5-day post mating treatment seem to have an oocyte in the oviduct (ovulation), suggesting the female was preparing to lay this egg immediately before dissections occurred. Furthermore, in the reproductive tracts of mated females, we were able to detect the genetic material passed on from the <italic>vas</italic>Cas9 males and not in the tracts of females that mated with pgSIT males using <italic>vas</italic>Cas9-specific primers. If genetic material was indeed transferred from pgSIT males to females, detection of the <italic>vas</italic>Cas9-specific amplicon would appear after PCR. The absence of the <italic>vas</italic>Cas9 amplicon coincides with the lack of mature sperm in the testis of pgSIT sterile males (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In the gRNA<sup>sxl, &#x003b2;tub</sup> mating, however, we were unable to obtain a signal (PCR amplicon using gRNA<sup>sxl, &#x003b2;tub</sup>-specific primers) in the DNA extracts of the reproductive tracts of wildtype females. We wonder if the gRNA<sup>sxl, &#x003b2;tub</sup> sperm transferred was sufficient to fertilize oocytes, but below the limit of detection. Although we would have liked to have detected the gRNA<sup>sxl, &#x003b2;tub</sup> amplicon for further evidence of our ability to detect transferred genetic material, the <italic>vas</italic>Cas9 PCR detection proved sufficient.</p><p id="Par25">The work detailed in this study expands on the unique characteristic of the pgSIT technology: no genetic material is transferred during mating. Other novel insect biocontrol technologies such as the Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal (RIDL), <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected insects, and gene drives have been proposed to combat insect pests. However, for these technologies to induce population suppression, they require the transfer of genetic material from the released male insect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. pgSIT has the advantages associated with genetically engineered insects without the risk of persisting and propagating in the environment. Before pgSIT can be widely used on the commercial scale, it must undergo rigorous evaluation by stakeholders, US-EPA, and USDA. Some biotechnologies, like RIDL and <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-based technologies, are further along in the regulatory approval process in some states as experimental use permits (EUP) for broad scale trials have been issued<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the release of irradiated sterile males (SIT) are not regulated by the U.S., despite the random DNA changes/mutations through DNA damage is caused by radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We hope that this study provides additional evidence of the sterility phenotype penetrance, precise gene edits at target genes and the lack of genetic persistence and propagation in pgSIT sterile males. pgSIT is a powerful and precise tool that can be implemented in the grower&#x02019;s IPM toolbox for insect pest control.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Construct design and assembly</title><p id="Par26">The initial development of the pgSIT strains in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> was originally described by Kandul et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The <italic>vas</italic>Cas9 construct was obtained from Dr. Omar Akbari and characterized in Kandul et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and was not modified prior to microinjection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). In this study, we chose to further modify the triple gRNA construct targeting &#x003b2;Tubulin 85D. To reduce the possibility of producing a functional mutation in the male-specific &#x003b2;Tubulin at 85D (&#x003b2;Tub85D or &#x003b2;Tub, NCBI GeneID:108015852), we chose to design and incorporate two gRNA target sites. CHOPCHOP v3 was used to choose the &#x003b2;Tub gRNA target sites that had minimal off-target activity. The sex lethal (<italic>sxl</italic>, NCBI GeneID:108016832) target sites described in Kandul et al., 2022 were used for targeting <italic>sxl</italic> gene to induce female lethality. For driving the expression of the gRNAs, we used the endogenous <italic>D. suzukii</italic> U6-1, U6-2, and U6-3 promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The 3&#x02019;-UTRs of each respective promoter were used directly after the gRNA scaffold to terminate gRNA transcription. To generate the pgSIT gRNA construct, gRNA<sup>sxl, &#x003b2;tub</sup>, containing a total of four gRNAs, we synthesized two intermediate dual gRNA constructs, Vector 11&#x000a0;A and Vector 11B using Genscript. Vector 11&#x000a0;A consists of a U6-3 promoter driving the expression of gRNA<sup>sxl#1</sup> and U6-1 promoter driving gRNA<sup>sxl#2</sup>. Vector 11B consists of a U6-2 promoter driving gRNA<sup>&#x003b2;</sup><sup>tub#1</sup> and U6-3 driving gRNA<sup>&#x003b2;</sup><sup>tub#2</sup>. We PCR amplified the <italic>Opie2</italic> promoter-<italic>mVenus</italic>-3&#x02019;UTR SV40 fluorescent marker as a fragment from the gRNA construct described in Kandul et al., 2022.

The male switch described in treatments #1 and #2 was done to imitate a scenario where a wild female mates with one strain then encounters another male of a second strain. After the switch, male flies were not replaced throughout the duration of the experiment. The F1 offspring was screened under a Leica Stereoscope with fluorescence. An mcherry/GFP double pass filter was used to simultaneously see both GFP and RFP markers. The total number of offspring and average offspring counts were determined.

Per treatment, 30 virgin wildtype females were paired with 15 males from gRNA<sup>sxl, &#x003b2;tub</sup>, <italic>vas</italic>Cas9, or pgSIT strains. As a negative control, virgin wildtype females were not paired with males. All flies, with the exception of the negative control, were allowed to mate with males for a total of five days to ensure all females had an opportunity to mate with a male. During this mating period, two females were randomly chosen on 1-, 3-, and 5- days post mating for ovary dissections and imaging. Ovaries were imaged using the View4K HD camera (Microscope Central) attached to the Leica M165FC stereomicroscope between 6.3X and 8.0X magnification.
