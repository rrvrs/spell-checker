The method relies on <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> proximity ligations produced by endonuclease cutting of cross-linked chromatin in cells that results in preferential binding of genomic fragments positioned physically near to each other in the nucleus. Given that a majority of reads represent intrachromosomal interactions, Hi-C is also an effective tool for haplotype phasing and genome assembly<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Short-read sequencing is classically employed in Hi-C with paired-end reads representing two interacting regions. While effective across a majority of the genome, short reads can fail to map uniquely across repetitive and low-complexity regions. Further, higher-order chromatin interactions that exist within the nucleus are difficult to parse when looking through a pairwise lens. Multi-contact 3C (MC-3C)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and Pore-C<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> have recently been developed that combine 3C with long-read sequencing (PacBio and nanopore, respectively) enabling a more complete picture of proximally-interacting concatemers. While these approaches are effective in disentangling three-dimensional (3D) genome folding at the allele level<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, both require significant starting material (e.g., 10 million cells for Pore-C) that have made them inaccessible to certain applications and organisms.</p><p id="P5">To overcome this challenge, we sought to optimize 3C coupled with PacBio HiFi sequencing. Testing library preparations on the human GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) with <italic toggle="yes">DpnII</italic> restriction endonuclease (as described for Pore-C<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>), we observed low sequence yields (10&#x02013;20% of standard Sequel II runs; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). While SMRT Cell loading was as expected, polymerase read lengths were short (mean 33.4 kbp) and showed a low abundance of HiFi reads (9.8% of polymerase reads; 3.46 Gbp at mean read length 7.24 kbp; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Repeating the experiment on LCLs using the MC-3C protocol yielded a similarly low HiFi yield, which is in line with published work<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S1</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Hypothesizing that residual cross-links remained on the DNA that prevent productive sequencing, following 3C we implemented a genome-wide amplification-based protocol designed for challenging samples<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, using a high-fidelity PCR enzyme to enrich for uncross-linked molecules ahead of sequencing (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This dramatically increased raw sequence yields and read lengths to standard sequencing performance (mean 105.3 kbp) and conversion to HiFi data (49.3% of polymerase reads; 30.6 Gbp at mean read length 9.35 kbp and median read quality value (QV) 38; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). The previous study<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> observed limited PCR biases; this was also the case for our GM12878 <italic toggle="yes">DpnII</italic> 3C library with 1.8% of our data representing PCR duplicates and no obvious dropouts evident when comparing read coverage with and without amplification (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To investigate the effects of multi-contact segment lengths and their resulting resolution of repetitive genomic regions, we performed 3C with <italic toggle="yes">DpnII</italic> (4 cutter) and <italic toggle="yes">HindIII</italic> (6 cutter), respectively, followed by amplification, size selection (&#x0003e;5 kbp), and Revio sequencing (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>). From the resulting HiFi reads (median lengths of 8.0 kbp; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>), subsequent <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> digestion produced a median of 17 segments at 350 bp for <italic toggle="yes">DpnII</italic> and 2 segments at 1,893 bp for <italic toggle="yes">HindIII</italic> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">D</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). We next mapped against the human reference genome (T2T-CHM13_v2<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>) and converted segments within each HiFi read into paired interactions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). For example, a single <italic toggle="yes">DpnII</italic> CiFi read with 17 segments represents 136 pairwise interactions, equivalent to 272 Illumina read pairs. Applying this to each CiFi datasets resulted in 2.1 billion interactions for <italic toggle="yes">DpnII</italic> and 38.5 million interactions for <italic toggle="yes">HindIII</italic>. Pairwise interactions showed the expected 3C decay with increasing distance (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) and spanned all length scales, going as far as &#x0003e;100 Mbp (the average size of a human chromosome).</p><p id="P7">Comparing mappings of CiFi segments with 101-bp paired-end Illumina Hi-C sequencing reads&#x02014;generated as a standard resource for GM12878<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>&#x02014;showed better representation across non-&#x0201c;unique&#x0201d; genome space, including short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) <italic toggle="yes">Alu</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Mir</italic>, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) <italic toggle="yes">L1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">L2</italic>, segmental duplications at both 90% (SD) and 98% (SD98) identity, and centromeres with and without the centromeric transition (CT) regions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). Improvements were most evident across SDs and centromeres, with only 33&#x02013;37% of Illumina Hi-C reads exhibiting a MAPQ cutoff &#x02265;1 compared with 83&#x02013;89% of CiFi with <italic toggle="yes">HindIII</italic> reads. Using pairwise data to generate genome-wide contact matrices (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>), we found an increased proportion of intrachromosomal interactions for <italic toggle="yes">DpnII</italic> CiFi (77.2%) versus Illumina Hi-C (65.7%). The two datasets largely correlate across chromosomes at 2.5 Mbp resolution (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.886), with unique regions more highly correlated (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.925) versus SDs and centromeres (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.687) due to the reduced read coverage of Hi-C (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Topologically-associating domains also exhibited concordance (MoC = 0.818) between methods across chromosome 1 and chromosome 2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref>), with notable differences at SDs. Together, CiFi and Hi-C similarly represent genome organization across a majority of the human genome, with CiFi providing notable improvements across repetitive and complex regions.</p><p id="P8">To explore the benefits of lower input requirements, we first scaled down GM12878 <italic toggle="yes">DpnII</italic> CiFi samples by over 100-fold, from 10 million cells (~60 &#x003bc;g of DNA input) to 62,000 cells (~370 ng), resulting in consistent sequencing metrics and contact matrices across all starting amounts (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S1</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). Moving beyond human cell lines, we next applied <italic toggle="yes">DpnII</italic> CiFi to a single <italic toggle="yes">Anopheles coluzzii</italic> mosquito (~250 ng starting input<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>) and generated 2.37 million HiFi reads and 21.1 million segments of median length 509 bp (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S1</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). From this, we successfully assayed pairwise chromatin interactions across the 263 Mbp reference genome (AcolN3) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7</xref>). Third, we leveraged CiFi to assemble the ~600 Mbp genome of a single Mediterranean fruit fly, <italic toggle="yes">Ceratitis capitata</italic>, by generating PacBio HiFi whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and CiFi reads from opposite halves of the same male individual split laterally (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref>). We successfully tested both the combining of HiFi and CiFi libraries in a single Revio sequencing run, and the barcoding and pooling of several CiFi libraries from different samples ahead of sequencing (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Using <italic toggle="yes">HindIII</italic> CiFi reads to both phase within<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and scaffold across contigs<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> resulted in a chromosome-scale, diploid assembly (2n = 12) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Adjusted QVs of the phased, chromosome-scale scaffolds ranged from 41.4&#x02013;58.1<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> with 96.7&#x02013;99.3% complete Diptera BUSCO values<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref>). Mapping CiFi fragments as paired-end reads back to the assembly showed the expected intrachromosomal contacts, and interactions between chromosomes 5 and Y, marking a known translocation characteristic of the strain used here<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Subsampling CiFi reads used to scaffold this assembly revealed that a minimum of 70,000 CiFi reads, resulting in approximately 300,000 proximity ligated pairs (equivalent to 1.5&#x000d7; coverage), were necessary for chromosome-scale scaffolding that is on par with the curated reference<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Highlighting limitations of the current CiFi approach, the use of restriction endonucleases has the potential to introduce biases in the regions assayed with certain loci naturally depleted for cutting sites; this can be mitigated by choosing alternative restriction sites or employing non-specific endonucleases<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, representing lines of future improvements. In addition, while we show that CiFi enables haplotype separation, phasing, and assembly scaffolding, improved computational approaches<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> that take full advantage of the higher-order multi-contact interactions inherent in CiFi reads can likely further enhance the resolving power of the approach.</p><p id="P10">In summary, CiFi enables efficient PacBio HiFi sequencing of 3C libraries from diverse species and sample types, and allows for high-quality, haplotype-resolved, chromosome-scale <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> genome assemblies with data from one sequencing technology, and, if desired, from a single sequencing run. A typical ~8 kbp CiFi read comprises multi-contact segments ranging in size from ~350 bp to 2 kbp that provides genome-wide chromatin contexts, including highly repetitive and low-complexity regions. We anticipate that the low-input requirement will expand the application of 3C with long-read sequencing to many single small organisms, as well as other samples, including isolated cell types and disease specimens such as tumor biopsies.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>METHODS</title><p id="P11">We developed an optimized protocol for multi-contact, long-read Hi-C library preparation with low DNA input, enabling efficient and accurate sequencing on the PacBio platform.
