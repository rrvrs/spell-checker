According to the World Population Prospects 2024 (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), the global population aged 65 and older is expected to reach 2.2 billion by the late 2070s, exceeding the number of individuals under the age of 18. As the country with the largest population of older adults (defined as those aged 60 and above) in the world (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), the number of older people in China has reached 296 million by 2023, accounting for 21.1% of the total population (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The huge older population has brought tremendous pressure on family, the social security system, and the healthcare system.</p><p>The older population is more likely to suffer from chronic diseases, the high-incidence of which include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, etc. These diseases often have prolonged courses and require multiple medical treatments. However, studies indicated that communications between older patients and healthcare providers were often negatively affected by a number of factors, including the patients&#x02019; cognitive impairment or physical dysfunction (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), the lack of family accompaniment during consultations (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and language barriers (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Moreover, older patients with comorbidities in Western countries face more difficulties when seeking medical treatment. For example, they often need to coordinate visit to different outpatient departments (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Long waiting time for medical treatment (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) also increases the difficulty for older patients to medical visit. In China, the first stop for diagnosis and treatment of older patients with chronic diseases is outpatient clinics (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In recent years, with the improvement of the information technology in Chinese hospitals, multi-functional self-service registration machines, electronic appointment and registration platforms, and convenient mobile payment methods have been employed in outpatient services. However, due to the fact that older patients learn and adapt to new technologies relatively slowly than younger ones, they generally encounter barriers when receiving high-tech outpatient services (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Barriers to healthcare access for older patients are becoming increasingly prominent worldwide, directly limiting the timely satisfaction of their health needs. As a result, worsened health conditions occur, thus increasing the physical and mental burden, impacting the quality of life, and even threatening the safety of life of older patients (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Ultimately, the healthy ageing process of the older population will be impeded.</p><p>As patient-centered health services, medical visit accompaniment (MVA) services can effectively cope with the difficulty in medical visits for older outpatient patients (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In the United States, family members such as spouse and children of older patients typically serve as medical visit accompaniment providers (MVAPs) (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). They participate in the entire medical visit process: assisting them in transportation, exchanging information with doctors, and follow-ups. Ishikawa et al. (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) found that the active participation of MVAPs greatly improved the efficiency of medical communication; as well as patients&#x02019; and doctors&#x02019; satisfaction with visits, appointment and treatment compliance. However, studies on MVA in Western countries mainly focused on the duties of the spouses, children of older patients or volunteers in community (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). On one hand, it is lacking of exploration of the MVA needs of older patients with chronic diseases; on the other hand, only few studies reported occupational MVAPs.</p><p>Chinese occupational MVA service is still in its infancy, however, its great potential in solving the problem of difficult consultation among older patients with chronic diseases cannot be ignored. In China, Medical visit accompaniment providers (MVAPs) refer to individuals who offer companionship and assistance to patients during medical visits as their occupation (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Their responsibilities include helping older patients with registration, waiting for consultation and examination, receiving medical reports, etc. (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Research showed that Chinese people have an urge for MVA services and prevailingly hold a positive attitude towards MVAPs (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Most studies on MVA in China focus on the perceptions and willingness of older patients and their family members regarding MVA services. However, research on the specific needs of older patients and family members for MVA is limited, which may affect the quality of MVA services and the medical experience of older patients.</p><p>Hence, this study explored the specific needs of outpatient older patients with chronic diseases and their family members for MVA services, aiming to provide insights for promoting the medical experience and healthy ageing of older patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec6"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec7"><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p>The study utilized a descriptive qualitative research methodology, and the research group adopted the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) guidelines (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), to ensure that the study meets the recommended standards for reporting qualitative data (see <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><label>2.2</label><title>Study setting and recruitment</title><p>The purposive sampling method was used to select outpatient older patients and their families from a tertiary hospital in Hangzhou from July to August 2024. The inclusion criteria for outpatient older patients were: (1) Age &#x02265; 60&#x0202f;years old; (2) Diagnosed with at least one chronic disease; and (3) Informed consent for the study. The exclusion criteria were: (1) Severe cognitive dysfunction; (2) Severe physical diseases; (3) Severe communicative problem such as hearing and/or speech dysfunction; and (4) Severe mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder). The inclusion criteria for family members were: (1) Having one or more older family members (&#x02265;60&#x0202f;years old) with at least one chronic disease diagnosed; (2) Able to communicate; and (3) Informed consent to the study. The exclusion criteria were: (1) Suffering from serious physical diseases; (2) Serious mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder); and (3) Serious hearing, speech, and cognitive dysfunction. The sample size was based on information saturation.

Based on the results of the pre-interviews and advice of experts, the interview outline was revised and optimized. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were then conducted to collect data by face-to-face. Before interviewing, researchers established a relationship with the interviewees. Researchers informed all interviewees of the purpose, significance, and methods of the study, promised confidentiality, and obtained their consent on recording the interviews. All interviewees signed informed consent forms and voluntarily participated in the study. The interviews were conducted in a conference room in the outpatient clinic to ensure quietness and privacy. During the interviews, the researchers avoided inducing conversation and paid attention to and recorded the nonverbal behaviours of the participants, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures. At the end of the interviews, the participants were given a brief reminder, and the interviews were concluded.

Older patients were coded as N1&#x02013;N19 and family members as S1&#x02013;S17 and their separate Word documents were created. The MAXQDA 2022 was used to store and manage the qualitative data obtained. Interview data were analyzed using directed content analysis (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The specific steps were as follows: (1) Key concepts were selected as initial coding categories based on ERG theory and literature. (2) By repeatedly reading the transcripts, the two researchers focused on the content related to the research question or ERG theory, labeling and annotating the contents, and extracting semantic units. (3) Codes were created by categorizing the relevant semantic units using the predetermined coding categories. (4) After completing coding, the researcher determined whether subcategories needed to be constructed based on the similarities and differences between the codes. (5) Texts that could not be classified using the initial coding scheme were given new codes, which ultimately led to the formation of new category genera, expanding the ERG theory.</p><p>The research team consisted of six researchers who had experiences in qualitative study. CHY, ZJY, FQY, and WCH conducted the interviews and took notes. CYH and ZJY independently analyzed the data of older patients while FQY and WCH independently analyzed the data from family members of older patients, with discrepancies resolved through consensus with HDQ. CHY, ZJY, FQY, YXY are female nursing undergraduates, WCH is a male undergraduate majoring in electronic commerce. HDQ, the lecturer from a nursing school, is a ph. D in nursing.

To enhance the credibility of this study, we adopted triangulation in data sources, peer debriefing and member checking. Triangulation was achieved through collecting interview data from both older adults and family members. Peer debriefing was conducted with a professor, a qualitative research expert outside the research team, who provided an external check to ensure the rigor of the results. As for member checking, the interviewees were asked to clarify any unclear information in real time during the interviews. After the interviews, transcripts were later returned to the interviewees for further confirmation. Revisions were made based on their feedback to ensure the authenticity and accuracy of the data. Detailed descriptions were used to ensure transferability, including vivid narratives, specific examples, and direct quotations from data sources such as interviews and memoranda. To ensure dependability, the research process was examined by two experts outside the research team, to assess potential researcher bias and the appropriateness of the research design. The data, findings, interpretations, and inferences were thoroughly reviewed by two experts, both external to the research team to achieve confirmability.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec14"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec15"><label>3.1</label><title>Characteristics of participants</title><p>The final sample included 19 outpatient older patients with chronic diseases, comprising 8 males and 11 females aged between 60 and 85 years (mean age:72.5&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;12.5&#x0202f;years).

In addition, the study found that older patients and their family members also had special needs for MVA services, including improving the efficiency of medical visits, enhancing the transparency of MVA service delivery, and providing personalized services. This is consistent with the statement proposed by the ERG theory that &#x0201c;an individual can have more than one need simultaneously&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><sec id="sec28"><label>4.1</label><title>Existence needs: fundamental requirements for MVA services</title><p>The results showed that the existence needs of outpatient older patients with chronic diseases and their family members included needs for basic services, security needs and the qualification of the MVAPs.</p><sec id="sec29"><label>4.1.1</label><title>Continuum of basic services needs in MVA services</title><p>The needs for basic services, which were the main content of the MVA, ran through the entire MVA service process&#x02014;before, during and after medical visits. These needs involved understanding the patient&#x02019;s conditions in advance, assisting in registration, assisting in medication and examination and explaining the doctor&#x02019;s instructions, etc. This finding is in line with previous studies (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Although those studies primarily focused on older patients&#x02019; family members, friends, or volunteers, their responsibilities closely resemble the existence needs identified in this study. This suggests that occupational MVAPs can enhance the quality of their services by drawing on the practices and roles traditionally undertaken by informal caregivers to offer more thoughtful and personalized care.</p></sec><sec id="sec30"><label>4.1.2</label><title>Security needs: first aid training and emergency response</title><p>The security needs for MVA services were mainly in coping with accidents. Chen et al. (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) emphasized the importance of safeguarding patients&#x02019; lives in the process of MVA, pointing out that the administrators of MVA services need to strengthen the training of MVAPs about first aid skills, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Consequently, the legitimate rights and lives of older patients could be protected. In South Korea, the Medical Dispute Mediation and Arbitration System establishes an emergency response plan, and immediately starts an early warning or alarm mechanism once an abnormal situation is found, effectively guaranteeing the safety of older patients (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Currently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in China has incorporated first aid training into the standardized curriculum for MVAPs, covering essential skills such as CPR, handling falls, and managing acute symptoms like chest pain or dizziness (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These equip MVAPs with the necessary competencies to address potential emergencies during medical visits, thereby enhancing patient safety.</p></sec><sec id="sec31"><label>4.1.3</label><title>Professional qualification requirements for MVAPs</title><p>MVAPs were expected to demonstrate professional competence, including possessing medical or nursing knowledge, relevant certificates, effective communication skills, and both physical and mental qualifications. Previous studies have found that older patients are often accompanied temporarily by their spouses, children, other relatives, friends and even community volunteers, which means that they have no clear qualification requirements for accompanying patients. Thus, they just fill the vacancy of accompanying patients (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, this study found that older patients with chronic diseases and their families were more inclined to be accompanied by MVAPs who had undergone professional training, held certifications and were familiar with medical knowledge. While MVA services are predominantly implemented across Asian countries, most of these services have not yet been deployed by unified institutions or departments (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). For example, MVAPs in Japan are typically patient&#x02019;s family members and lack professional qualifications (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In China, although institutions offering MVA services are gradually emerging, the industry remains in an early stage. A significant proportion of MVAPs still lack professional qualifications, contributing to limited public acceptance of their services (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>Another key finding of this study was that the interviewees generally emphasized the importance of MVAPs possessing both physical and psychological qualities. This may be due to the fact that, on one hand, MVAPs are required to perform physical tasks, such as carrying older patients up and down stairs and carrying objects; on the other hand, they need to show sufficient patience, empathy, and emotional management skills as older patients experience physical decline, decreased visual abilities, cognitive decline and slow reactions (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In recent years, under the organization of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Chinese government has gradually trained a group of qualified MVAPs to meet the needs of patients and their family members (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, there is still a large gap in the number of professional MVAPs at present. Moving forward, it is crucial for government departments to provide policy guidance and continuously expand the scale of professional training to ensure a solid talent base for the industry&#x02019;s development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec32"><label>4.2</label><title>Relatedness needs: social and emotional dimensions</title><sec id="sec33"><label>4.2.1</label><title>Relationship dynamics with MVAPs</title><p>The relationship needs of older patients with chronic diseases and their families in outpatient clinics included the relationship with the MVAPs and needs for emotional support. Regarding their relationship with accompaniment providers, older patients expressed a desire to connect with MVAPs like a family member or friend, while family members preferred that MVAPs maintain a more formal relationship, akin to that of an employee or friend. This finding indicated that older patients sought closer emotional bonds with MVAPs, which aligns with the Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The theory proposed that emotional goals become increasingly significant with age, leading older adults to prioritize emotionally meaningful social partners compared to younger individuals. In contrast, family members exhibited an instrumental relationship orientation consistent with the cost&#x02013;benefit analysis framework of Social Exchange Theory (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Accordingly, MVAPs should adopt differentiated strategies: providing emotion-focused support for older patients while maintaining professional boundaries and delivering standardized services for family members.</p></sec><sec id="sec34"><label>4.2.2</label><title>Emotional support strategies for MVAPs</title><p>Studies have found that older adults with chronic diseases were prone to loneliness and social isolation (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Coupled with the unfamiliar hospital environment, it is essential for MVAPs to provide warmth and care during their interactions. In terms of emotional support needs, both older patients and their family members hoped that the MVAPs could accompany the patients to alleviate their anxiety by chatting with them and providing psychological comfort while waiting for treatment. This finding is in line with the report (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) that simple conversational interventions, including active listening and empathetic communication, significantly reduce anxiety among older patients during medical visits and improve overall visit satisfaction. However, it should be noted that the psychological comfort provided by MVAPs is fundamentally different from professional psychological counseling offered by licensed therapists. Research indicates that psychological counseling conducted by non-professionals may carry potential risks (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This suggests that the psychological comfort provided by MVAPs should follow closely defined professional boundaries, avoiding interventions beyond their competence, particularly diagnostic questioning and the use of clinical terminology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec35"><label>4.3</label><title>Growth needs: educational and developmental aspects</title><sec id="sec36"><label>4.3.1</label><title>Learning needs: the opposite reviews</title><p>This study showed that a key subtheme of the growth needs of outpatient older patients with chronic disease and their family members was the willingness to learn. More than half of the older patients expressed their willingness to learn about knowledge of their diseases and how to go through the medical consultations. This is consistent with the findings of Swor et al. (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), who found that 58.6% of older patients were willing to learn healthcare-related knowledge and skills and believed they were capable of implementing these skills. The theory of re-socialization for older patients suggests that (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) they can adapt to society and maintain their physical and mental health through positive learning behaviours. Therefore, MVAPs could use simple language and visuals aids to help older patients understand and retain information (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Furthermore, the learning content must be practical: the information provided should not only be accurate but also applicable to the patients&#x02019; daily lives. For example, offering patients practical advice on improving their diet and exercise habits can enhance their self-management abilities.</p><p>In contrast, this study also indicated that most family members believed that older patients with chronic diseases did not need to learn. This perception may stem from family members&#x02019; stereotypes about older adults (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Internalized stereotypes on age can influence family members&#x02019; perceptions and behaviours towards older patients unconsciously. This leads them to believe that older patients fail to cope with changes in society and are more dependent on others (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). MVAPs should encourage family members to recognize and support the willingness of older patients to learn, thereby boosting patients&#x02019; self-confidence and sense of self-worth. However, MVAPs alone may not be sufficient to eliminate these stereotypes, which requires a broader societal effort. Promoting intergenerational communication between younger and older generations could be an effective way to reduce the stereotypes (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec37"><label>4.3.2</label><title>Learning contents: difference between the two populations</title><p>Another subtheme of the growth needs among older patients and family members was learning contents. The interviewees in this study believed that the learning contents should include both learning knowledge about diseases and how to complete medical consultation. This is a new finding that older patients could put forward detailed learning needs according to their physical conditions, while the needs expressed by family members were less specific and lacked in-depth understanding. The possible reason for this phenomenon is that family members give advice more from the perspective of a bystander, without the deep knowledge that older patients have about their own conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec38"><label>4.4</label><title>Service optimization needs: efficiency and personalization</title><p>This study revealed that family members had a more urgent need to shorten the waiting time for outpatient consultations. Although the procedures of outpatient care vary in different countries, long waiting time for patients is a common and prominent problem worldwide (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Mwanswila et al. (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) believed that optimizing the scheduling of outpatient appointments plays a crucial role in shortening the waiting time of patients. This requires MVAPs to coordinate appointment schedules effectively, ensuring that the waiting time of older patients is minimized as much as possible. This study found that family members were concerned about the transparency of MVA services. They sought to be fully informed about the older patient&#x02019;s care and be better involved in their medical visits. Rosland et al. (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) indicated the importance of family member involvement in managing older patients with chronic diseases, as it can improve both prognosis and quality of life. The transparency of MVA services can be better guaranteed by recording while the older patients and family members receive the MVA services and the provision of feedbacks of the MVAPs after service.</p><p>The results of the interviews also showed that both the older patients and their family members required individualized service, according to physical and psychological conditions, as well as language barriers. The needs for targeted and differentiated accompanying services in this study are in line with the findings from Yang et al. (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). To meet these individualized requirements, MVA service institutions should enhance their recruitment criteria by preferentially selecting candidates with relevant medical backgrounds, such as nursing or allied health professionals. This approach ensures that MVAPs possess the requisite professional knowledge and competencies to meet the diverse needs of older patients. Furthermore, existing patented technologies for intelligent matching of MVAPs can be implemented to optimize service delivery. Specifically, aligning patients with the most suitable MVA provider based on medical specialization, language proficiency (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), and experiences can significantly improve service precision and effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="sec39"><label>4.5</label><title>Family-centered care in MVA services</title><p>The results of this study coincided with the concept of family-centered care (FCC) emphasized by Hsu (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), as reflected in the desire of family members to be actively involved in older patients&#x02019; security, the transmission of medical advice, emotional support, encouragement of diseases education, and assistance with medication management and other aspects of disease management. The concept of family-centered care enables family members to effectively participate in the health management of older patients with chronic diseases, which greatly improves the health outcomes (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Therefore, by encouraging family members to actively participate in the MVA services, the platform can empower them to contribute meaningfully to both the MVA service and disease management of older patients, thus promoting a better medical experience and higher quality of life for patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec40"><label>4.6</label><title>Aligning MVA services with global healthy ageing initiatives</title><p>Globally, the United Nations General Assembly has declared 2021&#x02013;2030 the United Nations Decade of Action on Healthy Ageing, which brings together governments, international agencies, academic institutions, and professionals to foster coordinated and catalytic cooperation aimed at improving the lives of older adults, their families, and communities (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). The issue of difficult access to medical care for older patients are prominent, exposing the inadequacy of the global health system to respond to the specific needs of older population. This study focused on the MVA services, aiming to improve the experience and satisfaction of the older patients during medical treatment by refining service delivery and providing practical guidance for the healthcare system improvements.</p></sec><sec id="sec41"><label>4.7</label><title>Limitations</title><p>The results of the study are important for helping construct and improve the MVA service system and improving the medical experience of older patients.
