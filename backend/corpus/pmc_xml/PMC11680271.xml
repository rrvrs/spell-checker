Introduction</title><p>The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assay is commonly used to assess metabolic activity in both mammalian and microbial cells [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. First introduced in 1968, it initially served as a key diagnostic tool in human medicine for chronic granulomatous disease in infants [<xref rid="B3-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Over time, its applications in human medicine have expanded to include the assessment of various inflammatory and infectious conditions, such as viral meningoencephalitis [<xref rid="B4-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], tuberculosis [<xref rid="B5-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], hepatic abscesses caused by amebiasis [<xref rid="B6-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and several skin diseases [<xref rid="B7-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, the test has been employed as a general indicator of infection risk [<xref rid="B8-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The NBT reduction test is designed to indirectly assess the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils by measuring their NADPH oxidase activity [<xref rid="B9-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. During the process, NBT, which is initially soluble and colorless, is reduced by NADPH oxidase in active neutrophils within the phagosome, converting into formazan, an insoluble substance with a greyish-blue color. The rate at which NBT is reduced is assessed by calculating the percentage of neutrophils that contain formazan in the cytoplasm through conventional optical microscopy. The level of NBT reduction correlates directly with the amount of ROS generated by phagocytes during the oxidative burst [<xref rid="B10-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, the NBT reduction test serves as a method to indirectly evaluate ROS release by neutrophils by measuring NADPH oxidase activity [<xref rid="B9-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In veterinary practice, the NBT reduction test has been used to evaluate neutrophil activity in various conditions, including canine leishmaniosis [<xref rid="B2-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], ehrlichiosis [<xref rid="B12-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], diabetes mellitus [<xref rid="B13-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and transient immunosuppression following polyvalent vaccination [<xref rid="B14-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In a study on ehrlichiosis, although no significant differences were observed in the NBT test between infected and healthy dogs, neutrophils from infected dogs showed higher NBT-reducing activity after stimulation, suggesting an active response during the acute phase of the disease [<xref rid="B12-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In studies on leishmaniosis, neutrophil oxidative activity was found to be higher in the early stages of infection compared with seropositive healthy dogs and in the advanced stages of the disease [<xref rid="B2-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In dogs with diabetes mellitus, another study showed an increase in NBT reduction, which decreased after stimulation, possibly indicating a reduced bactericidal capacity of neutrophils [<xref rid="B13-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Finally, one study reported a significant decrease in neutrophil activity following polyvalent vaccination, suggesting a transient immunosuppression associated with a regulatory shift towards a TH2-type immune response [<xref rid="B14-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although the NBT has been studied in a variety of veterinary conditions, no studies have investigated its use in the diagnosis of bacterial skin infections in dogs.</p><p>In veterinary dermatology, several diseases may exhibit similar clinical patterns. For example, superficial pyoderma and immune-mediated diseases like sterile neutrophilic dermatitis can present as papulopustular dermatitis [<xref rid="B15-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, for an accurate diagnosis, complex clinical reasoning with the implementation of several diagnostic tests. Such as cutaneous cytology, dermatopathological examination, bacterial cultures, and even response to specific antibiotic treatment, is needed [<xref rid="B15-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Due to the challenges associated with the diagnosis of this clinical pattern, the initial hypothesis for this study was that the NBT reduction test may be a valuable tool for differentiating between certain bacterial infections from non-bacterial diseases. Therefore, the objective was to evaluate and compare the differences in ROS production by peripheral blood neutrophils in healthy dogs, dogs with superficial pyoderma, and those with sterile neutrophilic dermatitis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vetsci-11-00634"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-vetsci-11-00634"><title>2.1. Study Animals</title><p>Eighteen dogs of different breeds were selected from patients attending the dermatological service at the veterinary hospital of Universitat Aut&#x000f2;noma de Barcelona (Fundaci&#x000f3; Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nic Veterinari). These dogs were retrospectively divided into two groups. Group 1 included ten dogs with superficial pyoderma diagnosed based on clinical signs (papulopustular dermatitis), skin cytology (neutrophilic inflammation with intracellular cocci), and a favorable response to antibiotic treatment. Group 2 included eight dogs with sterile neutrophilic dermatitis. This diagnosis was based on clinical signs (papulopustular or placo-nodular dermatitis), skin cytology (neutrophilic inflammation in the absence of bacteria), and histopathological examination (neutrophilic pustular dermatitis with or without folliculitis) and confirmed through negative bacterial cultures or lack of response to specific antibiotic treatment and response to immunomodulatory treatment. Subgroup 2A consisted of three dogs with sterile neutrophilic pustular dermatitis, all seropositive for <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> spp. Two of the dogs were in stage IIa and one was in stage IIb according to the LeishVet stage [<xref rid="B17-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] classification. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed an increase in gamma globulins. The urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC) was &#x0003c;0.5 in two cases (non-proteinuric) and between 0.5 and 1 in one case (proteinuric). The ELISA for <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania infantum</italic> antibodies was highly positive (&#x02265;300 EU) in all three dogs. Subgroup 2B included five dogs with sterile neutrophilic dermatitis that were seronegative for <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> spp. Moreover, ten healthy dogs were included in group 3 as control dogs. Group 3 consisted of residual samples obtained during preliminary analytical tests for castration and ovariohysterectomy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-vetsci-11-00634"><title>2.2.

Blood Nitroblue Tetrazolium Reduction Test</title><p>In this study, the chosen form was powder (N6876, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), and it was prepared by diluting it in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution to a concentration of 0.1%. The NBT test was performed as previously described. The procedure carried out was as follows [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]: 100 &#x003bc;L of blood was placed into separate Eppendorf tubes and left for 15 min at room temperature. The blood was gently mixed before filling three 40 mm/20 &#x003bc;L hematocrit capillary microtubes. These capillary tubes were centrifuged at 2910&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 5 min to collect the buffy coat. The buffy coat from the three hematocrit tubes (5 &#x003bc;L total) was transferred into an Eppendorf containing an equal amount of 0.1% NBT solution. The Eppendorf was gently mixed and incubated at 37.5 &#x000b0;C for 15 min, then allowed to rest at room temperature for an additional 15 min. Two blood slides were prepared from each Eppendorf by placing 2 &#x003bc;L of the NBT-treated blood on each glass slide. To evaluate the NBT percentage, 100 neutrophils with distinct morphology were counted on each slide using standard light microscopy (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00634-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Only one author (MG) performed all the examinations. The NBT percentage was calculated by determining the proportion of activated neutrophils, indicated by the presence of blue-black formazan deposits, among the total neutrophils counted.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-vetsci-11-00634"><title>2.5. Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis of the data was performed with GraphPad Prism 8.0 for Mac (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). A series of normality tests, including Anderson&#x02013;Darling, D&#x02019;Agostino and Pearson, Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk, and Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov, were conducted to assess the normality of NBT rates. The NBT rates followed a normal distribution, and a <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Discussion</title><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the changes in the generation of ROS by neutrophils in the peripheral blood of healthy dogs, dogs with superficial pyoderma, and those with sterile neutrophilic dermatitis. Identifying a rapid and accurate indicator that can differentiate between a bacterial infection and a sterile condition would have significant clinical implications, facilitating therapeutic decision-making and reducing the risk of unnecessary diagnostic or therapeutic interventions [<xref rid="B18-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Currently, there is no available information in the literature on the use of the NBT reduction test to diagnose any bacterial infection in dogs other than ehrlichiosis. However, in human medicine, this is a controversial issue as some studies have supported its use as an indicator of bacterial infections [<xref rid="B18-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], whereas others have questioned its utility, arguing that the test measures a disease response that is not exclusive to bacterial infections and depends on the normal phagocytic function of neutrophils [<xref rid="B21-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The rate of reduction in NBT that was observed in the healthy group was like that reported in previous studies [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, the results of the study presented here revealed no significant differences between healthy dogs and dogs with superficial pyoderma, suggesting that there is no systemic activation of neutrophils in cases of superficial pyoderma. Interestingly, differences were identified between dogs with sterile neutrophilic dermatitis and healthy dogs and dogs with superficial pyoderma. These findings suggest the possibility of increased oxidative metabolism of neutrophils in the presence of a systemic immune-mediated condition. However, due to the limited number of cases in each group, further studies are necessary to verify this observation. Additionally, within the group with sterile neutrophilic dermatitis, dogs with leishmaniosis had a significantly higher NBT reduction test rate compared with seronegative dogs, suggesting that neutrophil activation is closely related to <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> infection. According to the reviewed literature, the increase in neutrophil oxidative metabolism is more pronounced in dogs with a mild stage (I LeishVet [<xref rid="B17-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) and healthy seropositive dogs than in dogs in more advanced stages of the disease (II-III-IV LeishVet [<xref rid="B17-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) [<xref rid="B2-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although clinical staging of dogs with leishmaniosis was not an initial objective, it is interesting to note that they were highly seropositive. The dogs in our study were at an advanced stage of leishmaniosis (stage IIa and stage IIb LeishVet [<xref rid="B17-vetsci-11-00634" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). This difference from previously published data could be due to the combination of systemic immune-mediated disease and leishmaniosis.</p><p>There are some limitations in the present study. The main one is the small number of dogs included. To confirm the usefulness of the NBT reduction test to discriminate bacterial and non-bacterial neutrophilic dermatitis, it would be necessary to increase the number of subjects studied, particularly in cases of sterile neutrophilic dermatitis without leishmaniosis. In addition, it would be very interesting to include patients with pemphigus foliaceous in this group, which is the most known purulent, immune-mediated skin disease in dogs. Moreover, it would be interesting to evaluate this test on peripheral neutrophils, especially in dogs with purulent skin diseases. However, although the authors attempted this experimental design, it was unsuccessful due to technical aspects (personal observation).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vetsci-11-00634"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The results indicate that the NBT test does not appear to distinguish between healthy dogs and those with superficial pyoderma. However, dogs with sterile neutrophilic dermatitis showed significantly higher NBT rates, especially if they were seropositive for <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> spp., suggesting increased production of ROS.
