These models vary in the factors used to predict risk, and have previously included various combinations of sociodemographic, cognitive, imaging, biomedical and genetic variables.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> However, while the availability and use of dementia risk scores is increasing, there are many limitations which still need to be addressed.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>For example, risk scores are often developed in a single population without external validation. While increased attention to this issue has been paid in recent years,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6 7</sup></xref> problems with external validation still persist. For instance, a 2019 systematic review of 61 available dementia risk scores found that only eight had been externally validated.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Moreover, those that had been validated often had poor and inconsistent performance in external samples. An external validation of four commonly used prediction models in a Dutch population found that only one model performed strongly (c-statistic &#x0003e;0.8) and all models were poorly calibrated with underestimation of low risk and overestimation of higher risk.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> A recent large-scale validation study assessed the performance of 17 risk models in an Icelandic population and found that only models which included comprehensive cognitive testing achieved moderate prediction accuracy (c-statistic &#x0003e;0.75), while all other models performed poorly (c-statistic &#x0003c;0.75).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>Several reasons may underlie the poor out-of-sample performance of dementia risk scores. First, the factors associated with dementia, as well the importance of each factor, may vary across different geographical locations. Most development cohorts are typically from North America, with few others coming from across Europe.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3 8</sup></xref> To our knowledge, there is only one dementia risk model that has been developed for the UK population, and little is known about how other externally-developed dementia risk models may perform in the UK.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Second, the risk factors associated with dementia may vary across the lifespan. Interestingly, Hou <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> noted that only four risk scores have been developed for use in mid-life compared with 39 developed for use in elderly populations.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Thus, many of the available models may not be applicable to adults in mid-life who stand to benefit the most from early interventions. Third, model overfitting could underlie poor out-of-sample performance, particularly as, until recently, the standard approach for developing risk scores involved conducting numerous univariate models to identify the best predictors of dementia from a long list of candidate predictors. Many dementia risk scores may integrate invasive (cerebrospinal fluid), time-intensive (cognitive batteries), or expensive (MRI) markers. While such scores may offer modest improvements of prediction accuracy, they are more appropriate for specialised clinical settings rather than routine primary care or for population screening where these measurements are not available at scale.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Objectives</title><p>In this study, we address these limitations by using data from the UK Biobank (UKB) study to develop a novel 14-year dementia risk score specific to a mid-life UK population, which we refer to as the UK Biobank Dementia Risk Score (UKBDRS). We externally validate our score in the Whitehall II (WHII) study, another UK-based cohort with mid-life assessments. We focus on easily accessible sociodemographic and clinical data to enable the wider use of the score for routine care or large-scale screening for preventative trials. To combat the challenge of overfitting, we employ regularised regression methods to select variables used in the UKBDRS. We also compare the performance of our score to three previously published dementia risk scores: the Australian National University Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Risk Index, ANU-ADRI<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>, the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Ageing, and Dementia score, CAIDE<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>, and the Dementia Risk Score, DRS<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>. We chose these other scores as they are widely used in research studies worldwide, have previously been validated in at least one external cohort,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3 6</sup></xref> are composed of easily accessible risk factors, and therefore offer a reasonable comparative framework against which to test our novel score.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sample selection</title><p>The UKBDRS was developed and validated internally in the UKB study and tested externally in the WHII study cohort. The UKB<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> is a longitudinal cohort study of over 500&#x02009;000 individuals (age range 40&#x02013;73 years). The WHII cohort<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> includes 10&#x02009;308 British civil servants recruited in 1985 (age range 35&#x02013;55 years) who have since received comprehensive clinical examinations approximately every 5&#x02009;years across 12 study waves. In both samples, we excluded individuals younger than 50 years in order to focus our analysis on those with increased likelihood of developing dementia within the study follow-up period, and to reduce the likelihood of including those with monogenic risk of developing dementia. We also excluded individuals with missing data on any of the candidate risk factors described. For detailed sample selection and inclusion/exclusion criteria, please see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1</xref> and the <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental methods</xref>. The UKB sample was split into a training set (80% of sample) and test set (20%), stratified for proportion of incident cases. APOE genotype is a strong, but less readily available, risk factor. Thus, we performed a second analysis to compute a version of the UKBDRS including APOE genotype.</p><p>The UKB study received ethical approval from the Northwest Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee and the WHII study obtained ethical approval from the University College London Medical School Committee on the Ethics of Human Research.

Importantly, the discriminative performance of our score was consistently higher than three other established risk models, further supporting its utility in predicting individual-level risk of dementia in a mid-life UK population. We offer an excel sheet (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/MelisAnaturk/dementia_risk_score/blob/main/results/UKB-DRS_Calculator.xlsx" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/MelisAnaturk/dementia_risk_score/blob/main/results/UKB-DRS_Calculator.xlsx</ext-link>) to calculate an individual&#x02019;s risk of dementia (we stress that this tool is for illustrative purposes only, not for clinical use, and does not replace clinical judgement). Individuals can also be classified into low-risk and high-risk groups, according to sensitivity and specificity thresholds reported in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 9</xref>. As the information required for computing the UKBDRS can be easily collected at a population level, and some can be managed by targeted interventions, the UKBDRS may be a promising screening tool for stratifying middle-aged UK individuals for preventative interventions. Our study also raised important considerations about the reliability of dementia risk scores, as evidenced by the poor out-of-sample performance of some external scores. We therefore discuss recommendations for using dementia risk scores in clinical trials.</p><p>The UKBDRS includes established modifiable risk factors for dementia, namely stroke, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and depression.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Our score also included material deprivation, fewer years of education, parental history, and living alone (ie, social isolation) as markers of increased risk, all of which have been repeatedly associated with dementia.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 26 27</sup></xref></p><p>In contrast to other risk scores, our model identified male sex as a predictive factor for dementia. Interestingly, a recent study of the UKB found that the risk of dementia was higher in men than women, and that a greater proportion of men had impaired cardiovascular health.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Thus, our findings are in line with other studies of the same population and may be driven by underlying cardiovascular issues. Our model also did not identify other factors previously linked to dementia risk, such as body mass index (BMI) and physical inactivity.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 3</sup></xref> It is possible that even if these lifestyle factors have been linked to risk of dementia, (1) their predictive utility for dementia may change with age and time to diagnosis, and (2) their non-specific role in the development of other diseases in later life may lessen their sensitivity and specificity for dementia. It is important to note that the goal of our study was to create an accurate, parsimonious model, as opposed to identifying all factors associated with dementia.</p><p>The UKBDRS consistently outperformed three scores previously developed for dementia risk prediction (ie, DRS, ANU-ADRI, CAIDE) in both internal and external validation samples. Our AUCs for the external dementia scores fell within the range of values reported from previous validation attempts (CAIDE 0.49&#x02013;0.78<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6 7 11</sup></xref>; ANU-ADRI 0.49&#x02013;0.78<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6 7 10</sup></xref>; DRS 0.56&#x02013;0.84<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6 9</sup></xref>). Both ANU-ADRI and CAIDE also performed worse in comparison to a model based solely on age, a striking observation but in line with their recent evaluation in the Rotterdam cohort.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> This could be for several reasons. First, certain predictors may not map precisely from one dataset to another. For example, CAIDE defines physically active individuals as those who exercise at least twice a week, lasting at least 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;min each time. UKB participants were instead asked how many minutes were spent being physically active on a typical day. Second, ANU-ADRI was developed for older individuals (60+), while our cohort is slightly younger (50+). However, our sensitivity analysis found that the ANU-ADRI also performed poorly when restricting our cohort to an age range matching its development sample. Third, CAIDE was designed to predict dementia over 20 years, while our cohorts had timeframes of only 14 and 17 years, respectively. Fourth, there were differences in diagnosis procedures between cohorts. CAIDE performed diagnosis according to DSM designations. Similarly, ANU-ADRI was developed specifically for Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease as opposed to the all-cause dementia outcome in our study. Finally, despite including all the predictors from the CAIDE and ANU-ADRI (except pesticide exposure) in our initial LASSO regression, only four of the seven predictors from CAIDE and four of the 12 predictors from ANU-ADRI were identified as important predictors in UKB. Five of the 14 predictors from the DRS model were initially selected as relevant predictors by our LASSO model. Thus, the performance of risk scores may be driven by population-specific differences.</p><p>Our score included age, which may be questioned as it is not a modifiable target. However, if the goal is to stratify for risk, then the inclusion of age is obvious. In this context, we note the good performance of the baseline age-only model. Age may proxy relevant information from several age-associated medical predictors (eg, cardiovascular health). A recently developed risk score which explicitly excluded age to focus on modifiable factors achieved an AUC of 0.59, demonstrating that age can be expected to be the driving force in many risk scores and poor discrimination can be expected when not considering age.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> We therefore suggest that risk scores with the explicit goal of risk stratification include age and other non-modifiable factors to achieve a stronger predictive performance.</p><p>It is possible our score could be improved by adding cognitive tests, brain MRI, and blood-based biomarkers of neurodegeneration.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> A recent review noted that high-performing risk scores included these variables, but as they are expensive and/or time consuming they would have limited application in population-level settings.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Moreover, UKB uses cohort-specific cognitive tests rather than established cognitive batteries typically used for dementia screenings which would have made it difficult to validate a cognition-based UKB score in other cohorts that do not have similar cognitive measures. Therefore, the UKBDRS may best be used as an initial screening tool to stratify individuals into risk groups, and those identified as high risk could then benefit from more time-consuming follow-up assessments described above for more detailed characterisation.</p><p>Several limitations need to be considered when interpreting our findings. First, we note that the UK Biobank does not have a gold standard clinically adjudicated dementia diagnosis. Nonetheless, our approach, which used a combination of primary care, hospital inpatient records, death certificates, and self-report, has previously demonstrated a strong PPV of 82.5% when compared with clinical adjudication,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> and has been used extensively in the UKB cohort.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14 15</sup></xref> As the reported PPV of this approach is lower when stratifying outcomes by dementia sub-type, we restricted our outcome to all-cause dementia.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref></p><p>Second, the UKB and WHII cohorts differed in the availability of data used for dementia classification, which may partly explain the difference in the prevalence of all-cause dementia (1.7% in UKB vs 3.2% in WHII). While death, primary care and hospital records were supplemented by self-report in UKB, only hospital inpatient records and self-report were available for the WHII which may have affected how sensitive we were in identifying &#x02018;true positives&#x02019;. We also note cohort differences in demographics, lifestyle, and health variables which may partly explain the lower AUC achieved in the external WHII sample.</p><p>Third, there were differences in the prevalence of factors used to compute the external scores, potentially affecting their predictive ability. For example, the UKB version of the ANU-ADRI excluded the cognitive component while the WHII version of this score missed information on traumatic brain injury and pesticide exposure. Moreover, WHII participants consumed more units of alcohol per week relative to UKB (18.8 units/week vs 14.3 units/week) and had substantially fewer women (28% vs 51%). The UKB also does not offer information on whether participants need help with their finances or medications, which prevented us from computing other risk models. We used complete case analyses and did not impute missing data to mimic settings in clinical practice. This may have introduced certain biases in our results.</p><p>Fourth, it is possible the samples of UKB and WHII data assessed introduced a healthy volunteer bias. While there were statistically significant differences between the included and excluded participants in terms of age, sex, and education, these were small (eg, age: 59.97 vs 60.71). The UKB and WHII cohorts are also healthier than the general population. For example, the prevalence of risk factors (eg, BMI, smoking) and rates of disease in the UKB are lower than in the general population.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> We used electronic health records to derive diagnoses, which make this large sample analysis feasible but may be less sensitive than clinical adjudication. Notably, the incidence of dementia in the UKB and WHII is lower than values reported for European and American populations and therefore under-ascertainment of dementia may be a limitation. Both the UKB and WHII cohorts are predominantly Caucasian and are less likely to live in socioeconomically deprived areas than the general UK population.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13 30</sup></xref> It is well known that dementia risk, onset and prevalence vary by race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Therefore, while the consistent performance of UKBDRS across these two independent cohorts adds confidence to its robustness, we emphasise the need to evaluate it across more diverse cohorts both in and out of the UK before translating it for wider use.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>We have developed and validated a novel dementia risk score, which outperformed other established risk scores in both an internal and external validation dataset. We recommend the UKBDRS for future studies interested in midlife dementia risk in a UK population. The UKBDRS includes age, education, material deprivation, history of diabetes, depression, stroke, parental history of dementia, hypertensive status, cholesterol status, sex, and household occupancy, making it easy to assess in large populations. We also present a version of the UKBDRS which includes APOE4 and can offer improved performance if this information is available. With further validation, the UKBDRS may be useful as a dementia screening tool for a wide range of middle-aged adults in either a clinical or research setting.</p><p>Importantly, this study raises concerns about the overall generalisability of dementia risk models. Our findings and others have shown that dementia risk scores typically have reduced predictive accuracy when applied under different settings. This suggests that there is unlikely to be a single &#x02018;one-size-fits-all&#x02019; dementia risk score for all populations. Instead, we suggest that any clinical trial should carefully consider the demographics of their participants and either identify a closely matched risk score, or pool together predictions from multiple risk models, with the UKBDRS potentially serving as one of these models.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjment-2023-300719</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xlink:href="bmjment-2023-300719supp001.pdf" id="d67e1430" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all participants of the UK Biobank and Whitehall II studies for dedicating their time towards these projects.
