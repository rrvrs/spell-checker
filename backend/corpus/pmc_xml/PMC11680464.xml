The Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and Two-Minute Walk Test (2MWT) are commonly used to assess functional exercise capacity in COPD patients. This study aims to evaluate the correlation between the distance covered in the 2MWT and 6MWT with spirometric indices (such as Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV&#x02081;), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), and FEV&#x02081;/FVC) in COPD patients.</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>This cross-sectional study involved 50 severe and very severe COPD patients diagnosed according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria. Systematic random sampling was adopted to select the study participants. Each patient underwent spirometry to measure FEV&#x02081;, FVC, and FEV&#x02081;/FVC ratio. Following spirometry, both the 2MWT and 6MWT were conducted on separate days under standardised conditions.</p><p>Results</p><p>The average distance covered by the patients with very severe obstruction in 6MWT and 2MWT was 148&#x000b1;5.0 and 113.60&#x000b1;4.4. Patients with severe obstruction in 6MWT and 2MWT covered an average distance of 163.10&#x000b1;12.4 and 125.73&#x000b1;11.8, respectively. The mean FEV&#x02081;/FVC ratio and the mean FEV&#x02081; %&#x000a0;in 6MWT were 38.4 and 30.6 with a significant p-value of &#x0003c;0.001. The mean FEV&#x02081;/FVC ratio and the mean FEV&#x02081; % in 2MWT were 32 and 29, respectively, with a significant p-value of &#x0003c;0.003.&#x000a0;Both 2MWT and 6MWT distances were significantly correlated with spirometric indices, particularly FEV&#x02081; and FEV&#x02081;/FVC ratio.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>We found that there was no significant difference among spirometric indices between the two groups. Hence, 2MWT can be used as a reliable prognostic screening tool as it poses an advantage like decreasing the exhaustion for COPD patients as they find it more difficult to complete the 6MWT, resulting in increased heart rate and easy fatiguability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>2-minute walk test</kwd><kwd>6-minute walk test</kwd><kwd>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(copd)</kwd><kwd>sp02</kwd><kwd>spirometry</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dyspnea, coughing, sputum production, and exacerbations are among the chronic respiratory symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a heterogeneous lung condition caused by abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that result in persistent, frequently progressive airflow obstruction [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. About 90% of deaths from COPD occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), making it the third most common cause of mortality at the moment. Early diagnosis and therapy are essential to lessen flare-ups and decrease the progression of symptoms [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Due to ongoing exposure to COPD risk factors and population aging, the burden of COPD is expected to rise globally over the next several decades. Globally, COPD is the primary cause of chronic morbidity and mortality. Many people with COPD or its consequences die young and suffer from the illness for years [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While the incidence of tobacco use is frequently closely linked to the prevalence of COPD, major risk factors for COPD in many nations include indoor, outdoor, and workplace air pollution from burning wood and other biomass fuels [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is estimated that COPD causes over three million deaths worldwide each year [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Over 5.4 million people will die from COPD and related diseases each year by 2060 as a result of rising smoking rates in LMICs and aging populations in high-income nations [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Exercise capacity, a crucial component of COPD management, is typically assessed using field walk tests that provide insights into disease severity and patient prognosis. The Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) is a study that offers prognostic, treatment response, and functional data useful for treating patients with heart and respiratory conditions with its simplicity and consistency&#x000a0;provide a combined picture of the musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary responses to exercise, making it a popular tool [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since the 6MWT is directly correlated with low quality of life indices, respiratory and functional impairment, and survival, it has been recognized as a key indicator of disease severity for patients with COPD, which also shows the clinical reaction to chronic respiratory conditions and procedures like lung volume reduction surgery [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The average Six-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) for chronic lung illness is between 300 and 400 meters [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The risk of aggravation, hospitalization, and death is inversely connected with a 6MWD of 350 meters in people with COPD [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>However, for patients with severe COPD, including those with comorbidities like cardiovascular disease, neuromuscular disorders, or frailty, completing the 6MWT can be challenging due to fatigue and dyspnea. As a result, the Two-Minute Walk Test (2MWT), which is shorter in duration, has been suggested as a potentially useful alternative for assessing functional capacity in patients who cannot perform the full 6MWT [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although less commonly used, the 2MWT may offer advantages in severe cases by reducing physical exhaustion while providing valuable prognostic information&#x0200b; [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hence, 2MWT, which has a shorter duration, would possibly be an effective alternative tool for the&#x000a0;assessment of prognosis in severe COPD patients.&#x000a0;Our study aimed to assess the correlation of 6MWT and 2MWT with spirometric indices among severe and very severe COPD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study area and setting</p><p>The present study was conducted by the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Sri Manakula Vinayagar Medical College and Hospital, Puducherry.

To achieve the desired sample size, all the patients attending the respiratory medicine department with severe and very severe COPD were included in the study after spirometric evaluation. Patients visiting OPD on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday were chosen for a 2MWT followed by a&#x000a0;6MWT on the next day, and patients visiting on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday were made to perform a 6MWT followed by a 2MWT on the next day.</p><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</p><p>Patients over 18 years old with severe and very severe COPD (GOLD criteria) who provided informed consent were included. Exclusion criteria were patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, other chronic lung diseases, systemic diseases, or those unwilling to participate.</p><p>Data collection procedure</p><p>Data was collected by the Principal Investigator (PI) using a pretested semi-structured questionnaire (Appendix), which comprised sociodemographic details, clinical history, anthropometric measurements, and severity of COPD assessed using GOLD criteria. The procedure of spirometry was explained to the patient in simple language. It was done using a computerized vitalograph series using WinspiroPRO 5.8 pneumotach, following the principles of spirometry in a sitting position. Spirometric indices (such as FEV&#x02081;, FVC, and FEV&#x02081;/FVC) were evaluated in patients.</p><p>The tests were carried out in the fixed hour of the day (10.00-14.00 hrs) to minimize diurnal variation, and the walk test was also performed in the same hours of the day to avoid intraday variability. All walk tests were conducted by the trained PI on the same 30-meter track and time of day, following the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS). Patients were instructed to remain on regular medication schedules and were allowed to walk at their own pace. The distance walked by the patients, as well as pre-and post-test saturation and vitals, was recorded and analyzed at the end of two minutes and six minutes.</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>All data were entered in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and analyzed in SPSS v26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics, expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, captured baseline characteristics such as distance walked and spirometric values (FEV&#x02081;, FVC, FEV&#x02081;/FVC) and frequency with percentage for categorical variables.&#x000a0;Comparative analyses were done using independent t-tests for continuous variables. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated a strong, statistically significant correlation between the distance covered in both walk tests and spirometric indices. All tests were considered statistically significant if the p-value was less than 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In this study, 50 patients with severe and very severe COPD participated; the study population primarily consisted of older adults, with 34 (68%) aged over 60 years and 16 (32%) below 60 years.

Similarly, the highest breathing frequency was strongly correlated with disease severity (r = 0.75 in MMRC III and r = 0.79 in MMRC IV), as patients in advanced COPD stages required higher respiratory rates to compensate for limited airflow.&#x000a0;</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><title>Correlations Between Two-Minute Walk Test and Six-Minute Walk Test Parameters Among the Study Participants (n = 50).</title><p>MMRC - Modified Medical Research Council</p><p>Pearson's correlation test</p><p>*p-value &#x0003c;0.05 is considered significant</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameters</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMRC III (n=24) r</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMRC IV (n=26) r</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Walk distance</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.80*</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.77*</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Minimum oxygen saturation during test</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.81*</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.83*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Maximum heart rate during test</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.85*</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.76*</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Highest breathing frequency during test</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.75*</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.79*</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The study was carried out among 50 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COPD as per GOLD guidelines, and they were subjected to 6MWD and 2MWD followed by spirometry on alternate days.&#x000a0;The present study assessed the association between the 2MWT and 6MWT&#x000a0;distances with spirometric indices in patients with severe and very severe COPD. The findings indicate a statistically significant correlation between the distance walked in both tests and spirometric parameters, specifically FEV&#x02081;, FVC, and the FEV&#x02081;/FVC ratio. Patients in the severe COPD group (GOLD stage III) consistently walked longer distances in both the 2MWT and 6MWT compared to those in the very severe COPD group (GOLD stage IV), reflecting progressive functional decline with increasing COPD severity.&#x000a0;</p><p>Gupta et al. studied the relationship between lung function tests (spirometry), the 6MWT, and breathlessness severity in COPD patients. They found that the distance covered during the 6MWT was closely linked to the severity of dyspnea as measured by the MMRC scale. However, patients with other health issues like heart disease, muscle disorders, or arthritis often found it difficult to complete the 6MWT due to fatigue [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This suggests that the 2MWT is a suitable alternative to the 6MWT, especially for patients with severe COPD. Our study addresses including the 2MWT as an alternative assessment, a shorter test with potential advantages for patients with severe COPD. Gloeckl et al. compared the 2MWT&#x000a0;and the 6MWT&#x000a0;to see how well they detect exercise-related drops in oxygen levels in COPD patients. They found no significant difference in the lowest oxygen saturation recorded during the two tests&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Hajare RB et al. investigated the relationship between 6MWD&#x000a0;and spirometry parameters in 50 stable COPD patients. They performed spirometry tests measuring FEV&#x02081;, FVC, and FEV&#x02081;/FVC&#x000a0;finding a significant positive correlation between the percent predicted 6MWD and these parameters [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, Chandra et al. studied the correlation between 6MWT results and spirometric findings in 60 confirmed COPD patients. Using pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry, they observed that 6MWD was significantly positively correlated with FEV&#x02081;, FVC, FEV&#x02081;/FVC, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), highlighting the relationship between lung function and exercise capacity in COPD&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>According to a study by Mitali et al., which evaluated the relationship between 6MWT and spirometry in 130 individuals with COPD, there was a substantial association between the two measures [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To measure the functional exercise capacity of 50 COPD patients, Beaumont et al. conducted a study to validate the three-minute step test (3MST) and compare the 3MST and 6MWT in stable patients with COPD. At the conclusion of the 3MST and the 6MWT, there was a significant difference in heart rate and SpO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Following the 3MST, lower limb tiredness was noticeably higher. According to the study's findings, patients with stable COPD can have their functional exercise capacity estimated using the 3MST instead of the 6MWT.</p><p>In a newly published study, Roberts et al. looked at adverse events that occurred during 6MWT in a large cohort of 1136 patients with moderate to severe COPD, which showed that 2.2% of the participants under investigation experienced an adverse event during the 6MWT, according to the findings. Palpitations, chest tightness, chest pain, and dizziness were the most frequent side effects. There were no noteworthy cases of morbidity or death noted. Given the significantly shorter test duration, a 2MWT would probably lower the likelihood of test-related incidents, even though the exact time of the 6MWT event occurrence was not disclosed. We observed no adverse effects from the two- or six-minute walk assessments, even though the current study was not designed to evaluate safety [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Beyond safety considerations, the 2MWT offers additional potential benefits over the 6MWT, particularly for patients with severe COPD. Using a shorter-duration walk test could be more practical and less tiring as it provides comparable results to the 6MWT. The 2MWT&#x02019;s shorter time requirement could allow for more frequent repetitions, which would be useful for interim evaluation of treatment effects or for fine-tuning the optimal oxygen flow rate during physical activity. The 2MWT may also be useful in determining the right level of intensity for a training program that involves walking. More research is needed to determine if the 2MWT is as good as the 6MWT at determining training intensities based on walking speed.&#x000a0;In clinical settings, the 2MWT could serve as a quicker assessment tool, saving time in busy daily clinical routines.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>Our study is the first to assess the relationship between spirometric indices and the distance covered&#x000a0;in the 2MWT and 6MWT among severe and very severe COPD patients. However, the study has several limitations that warrant attention. First, the sample size of 50 patients, although adequate for detecting significant associations, limits the generalizability of the results, particularly across different demographics or less severe COPD cases. Secondly, the study focused exclusively on severe and very severe COPD patients, meaning that findings may not apply to patients with mild or moderate COPD, where the correlation between walk tests and spirometric indices might differ. Additionally, the study did not account for other variables like comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or musculoskeletal disorders) that could affect walking performance, potentially confounding the results. Finally, the cross-sectional design limits the ability to assess changes in functional capacity or spirometric indices over time, which would be valuable in longitudinal COPD management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The 2MWT and the 6MWT show good grades of congruence and correlation when evaluating exercise-induced oxygen desaturation, a critical indicator of disease condition in patients with severe COPD. Other 6MWT indicators, including heart rate, breathing rate, and perceived effort levels, were comparable to 2MWT in individuals with severe COPD. The 2MWT is easy to use and practical; these patients tolerated it well. As a result, the 2MWD might be more significant than previously thought, and there was a significant correlation between spirometric parameters and 2MWT among severe COPD patients. Hence, we conclude that the 2MWT can be used as a simple, reliable, and effective alternative tool for the&#x000a0;assessment of prognosis in severe COPD patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
