Despite efforts to prevent it, the risk remains high. Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG, an AUTOLOGOUS fibrin matrix with thrombocytes derived from the patient&#x02019;s blood, shows promise but has not been thoroughly tested in rectal anastomosis.

Treatment with curative intent often includes surgery with a bowel resection. Here it is often possible to re-establish bowel continuity by creating an anastomosis. Unfortunately, the anastomosis does not always heal sufficiently, and an anastomotic leak (AL) may develop.</p><p id="Par6">AL is a feared and serious complication, where bowel content will flow into the abdominal or pelvic cavity. Usually, AL occurs within the first 2&#x000a0;weeks after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The risk of AL following rectal cancer resection is 10&#x02013;15%, whereas it is less than 3&#x02013;4% following colon cancer resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Several factors appear to influence the risk of developing AL. They can be classified into preoperative factors such as patient- and disease-related characteristics, intraoperative factors such as surgical and anastomotic issues and surgeon&#x02019;s experience, and perioperative factors such as use of medications that might impair healing. For rectal resections, the increased AL risk can, to some extent, be attributed to difficulties in performing the anastomosis in the narrow pelvic cavity; a challenging blood supply of the anastomosis, in close vicinity of anal sphincters; and male sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the case of rectal cancer, having received neoadjuvant radio- chemo-therapy further increases the risk of AL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To this day, there are no well-established, validated, internationally recognized prediction model for AL, and the incidence of AL is still unpredictable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Several initiatives aiming to reduce the AL rate following rectal cancer resection have already been made. These include refinement of surgical and anastomotic techniques, intraoperative evaluation of blood supply of the oral bowel and anal rectal stumps, preoperative oral antibiotics and mechanical bowel preparation, and prohibition of non-steroidal inflammatory drugs and steroids in the perioperative course, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite these, the AL rate following rectal cancer surgery is still much too high.</p><p id="Par8">In a pilot study, Shamiyeh et al. examined the benefit of applying an autologous fibrin matrix in combination with thrombocytes, named Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG, onto and around the anastomotic area, during colorectal anastomotic creation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The rationale was that this would reinforce the anastomosis as well as strengthen the healing process. Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG was applied in all 271 cases included in this retrospective, two-center observational study. The AL rate was 2.3% (4/177) following colonic resection and 2.4% (2/84) following rectal resection. Although no comparison group was used, these AL rates are definitely promising, suggesting this method warrants further research.</p><p id="Par9">Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG is prepared from the patient&#x02019;s own blood, which following a processing leaves a fibrin matrix with a high concentration of embedded non-activated thrombocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At the site of application, these thrombocytes are, over a period of 4&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days, released and activated through natural proteolytic absorption and degradation of the fibrin matrix. Activated thrombocytes will release growth factors and hereby activate fibroblast differentiation and migration, promote angiogenesis, and stimulate wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]<italic>.</italic> The fibrin matrix of Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG acts therefore as a carrier material, which protects the growth factors and releases them slowly in the application area. However, it also acts as a hemostatic agent, due to its high elasticity and tensile strength, which leads to better tissue adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These characteristics can be used to reinforce the anastomosis. Autologous fibrin sealant is increasing being evaluated in different clinical settings, like in pancreatectomy, to reduce the risk of pancreatic fistula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], during pulmonary resection, to control alveolar air leak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], during esophageal anastomosis, to reduce the risk of AL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], during the treatment of anal fistulas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and others.</p><p id="Par10">Due to the above reasons, and as part of multi-year process aiming to reduce the AL rate, our department planned to implement the use of autologous fibrin matrix in combination with thrombocytes, Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG, in restorative rectal cancer resection. However, first we aimed to assess the feasibility of successful use and application of Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG as a supplemental procedure in the creation of rectal anastomosis when performing minimally invasive rectal cancer resection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par11">This prospective cohort study was a single-center, observational, clinical study investigating the feasibility of applying Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG on rectal anastomosis during minimally invasive rectal cancer resection.</p><p id="Par12">The study was approved by The Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics (journal no. 1&#x02013;10&#x02013;72&#x02013;187-20), registered at the Danish Data Protection Agency (1&#x02013;16-02&#x02013;60-22), preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05293054) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and conducted in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and the IDEAL stage 2a framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Written informed consent was obtained from included patients and the Helsinki declaration was followed in all aspects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par14">The study was conducted at Department of Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital (AUH) from December 2021 through November 2023.

Prior to the start of the study, the sponsor (LHI) and a colorectal surgeon had an on-site visit at Kepler University Clinic, Linz, Austria, to observe the use Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG by Professor A.

A product manager instructed theater nurses and all colorectal surgeons in the preparation of the autologous fibrin matrix by use of Vivostat&#x000ae; System (Vivostat A/S, Lillerod, Denmark). All colorectal surgeons were trained in the application of Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG with minimally invasive technique in the form of e-learning (instructional videos).

The mixture was heated, underwent centrifugation, and was merged with 30 units of Batroxobin. This process separated the mixture into a concentrate of fibrin I and thrombocytes, and excess serum, the latter of which was led into a waste chamber. The concentrate was then mixed with 3.5&#x000a0;mL of pH4 sodium acetate buffer, and was transferred into an empty syringe. The 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;mL concentrate was thus ready for application, and the syringe was loaded into the Vivostat&#x000ae; System applicator unit. This whole process took approximately 30&#x000a0;min.</p><p id="Par23">During application, the applicator unit simultaneously delivered the fibrin- and thrombocyte-concentrate together with a pH10 buffer solution, ensuring a neutral pH necessary for Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Application of Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG</title><p id="Par24">When the rectal cancer resection was completed and the specimen was extracted, Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG was applied using minimally invasive technique and an endoscopic kit device connected to the applicator unit.</p><p id="Par25">The application process was divided into 3 steps:</p><p id="Par26">Step 1: 1.5&#x02013;2&#x000a0;mL Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG was applied onto the rectal stump, with the circular stapler device inserted transanally into the rectal stump.

This doubt is further strengthened by the evaluation of its user friendliness, where surgeons found the application &#x0201c;Difficult, but can be performed&#x0201d; in one third of procedures. Application on the posterior part of the anastomosis was especially challenging for the surgeons, due to lack of sufficient space to visualize the anastomosis safely.

The use of the Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG matrix in rectal anastomosis has already been reported in a retrospective study of Shamiyeh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], who reported a low AL rate of 2.4% following rectal resection. Our study was not designed to investigate effect of the Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG matrix on anastomotic healing. We noted a somewhat higher AL rate of 10.6% although within the 95% CI of the national clinical quality indicator standard for rectal anastomotic leakage set at&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;8% by the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The observed AL rate was comparable to rates previously reported from our institution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, the discordant AL rates could stem from variations in surgical technique, patient selection, and use of neoadjuvant therapy, among others, underlining the necessity for standardized protocols in future trials. Here, we have shown that the application of Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG is feasible, and thus enabling implementation of this technique, should future research demonstrate a beneficial effect on the AL rate.</p><p id="Par81">Some limitations should be mentioned. None of the rating assessment scale and the self-assessment scale were validated instruments. However, both were pre-defined before study start. Due to the nature of our study design, the definition of a feasible application was arbitrary. Although we strove to provide a fair definition, this can lead to questions about whether or not the application was indeed feasible. Moreover, even though we felt that an &#x0201c;Almost complete&#x0201d; application should be counted as feasible, as the most important steps in the process had been completed, others might criticize this. A further limitation is the single-center design, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. However, six different surgeons performed the 50 applications.</p><p id="Par82">An important consideration in the use of Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG is the required 120 mL blood draw for its preparation and the iatrogenic blood loss this entails. While the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group (DCCG) guidelines ensure that colorectal cancer patients are routinely screened for anemia and treated with intravenous iron if needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and while the overall intraoperative blood loss, seen in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, was minimal due to the use of minimally invasive techniques, untreated anemia has been linked to decreased long term survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Interestingly, this same multicenter snapshot study found no association between anemia and postoperative complications or 30-day mortality.</p><p id="Par83">Recent recommendations from an Italian multisociety consensus on patient blood management in major digestive surgery emphasize the importance of minimizing phlebotomy for laboratory blood tests when not clinically justified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. While the 120 mL blood loss is indeed small, and was not deemed problematic by The Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics, the impact of preoperative blood draws should not be disregarded. In surgical settings with an anticipated high intraoperative blood loss or in patients with untreated anemia, it might be considered to avoid this blood loss, until the potential benefits of Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG are better understood.</p><p id="Par84">For future research, our OBANORES trial lays the groundwork for larger-scale, multi-center studies to further investigate the efficacy of Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG. Randomized clinical studies with placebo-controlled use of Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG as the ongoing, international multi-center ORSY trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] or Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG versus other anastomotic reinforcement techniques will be essential to establish its effect on AL rates. It should also be investigated whether all three steps in the application are necessary to achieve the potential strengthened healing of a rectal anastomosis, or if certain steps can be omitted. Of notice, we found no difference in AL rate following &#x0201c;Complete&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Almost complete&#x0201d; applications, recognizing our study was not powered to evaluate AL rate. Its impact on long-term outcomes, such as cancer recurrence rates and overall survival, as well as its effectiveness across diverse patient demographics should also be explored.</p><p id="Par85">In conclusion, the OBANORES trial exhibits the successful integration of the Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG autologous fibrin matrix in minimally invasive rectal cancer resection. Given the nature of rectal cancer surgery and its complications such as anastomotic leakage, Obsidian&#x000ae;ASG could be instrumental in improving patient outcomes, though further research is mandated to validate these results, before this technique should be integrated into standard clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contribution</title><p>All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
