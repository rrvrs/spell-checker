</p><sec id="eat24343-sec-0007"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Eating disorders (EDs) are distressing and disabling mental health disorders which affect up to 15% of cisgender women and 5% of cisgender men (Hay et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Micali et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Despite their impact and prevalence, access to treatment is often delayed or does not occur at all (Hart et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Weissman and Rosselli&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). A systematic review of Duration of Untreated ED (DUED) found that, when treatment does occur, mean DUED is 30&#x02009;months for anorexia nervosa (AN), 53&#x02009;months for bulimia nervosa (BN), and 67&#x02009;months for binge eating disorder (BED) (Austin et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). This review captured literature from before the COVID&#x02010;19 pandemic, and demand on ED services is known to have increased since (e.g., Viljoen et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Improving access to treatment and reducing DUED requires promotion of help&#x02010;seeking but also sufficient resources to meet treatment demand (Kazdin, Fitzsimmons&#x02010;Craft, and Wilfley&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Currently, ED services are under&#x02010;resourced to meet demand (Viljoen et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>), and there is not an adequate workforce available to provide ED&#x02010;focused psychological therapies via the &#x02018;dominant model of treatment delivery&#x02019; (Kazdin, Fitzsimmons&#x02010;Craft, and Wilfley&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This refers to the historical tendency for psychological therapies to be delivered via individual, in&#x02010;person sessions with a highly trained mental health professional in a specialist mental health or ED treatment center. This approach is resource&#x02010;intensive and limits the accessibility and availability of treatment. Novel models of intervention delivery have been proposed (e.g., Kazdin&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>), with key areas of emphasis including task&#x02010;shifting (where possible) to a less highly trained workforce and making use of &#x0201c;disruptive innovations&#x0201d; which are more readily scalable, including digital technologies.</p><p>Programme&#x02010;led and focused interventions offer opportunities for disrupting the dominant model of treatment delivery and reducing the gap between resources and demand. Programme&#x02010;led interventions have been defined as interventions where the expertise is in the programme (e.g., within a book or digital programme) rather than the therapist/professional, and focused interventions as those which require 50% or less therapist time than the standard alternative treatment (Davey et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Evidence&#x02010;based programme&#x02010;led interventions for EDs include guided self&#x02010;help (GSH) based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED). Focused treatment is available in 10&#x02010;session CBT for non&#x02010;underweight EDs (CBT&#x02010;T) (Waller et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). These interventions may be offered as standalone treatments or as part of a stepped care pathway, where initial non&#x02010;response to GSH or CBT&#x02010;T sees patients &#x0201c;stepped up&#x0201d; to a more senior clinician and/or a longer form of therapy.</p><p>GSH based on CBT is recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as the first&#x02010;line treatment for BN and BED (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). GSH is also recommended in other international clinical guidelines for BN and BED, although without specific advice about when to offer this relative to other treatments (Hilbert, Hoek, and Schmidt&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). There is good evidence for the effectiveness of GSH in reducing binge eating and ED psychopathology, often with outcomes that are comparable to those from longer forms of CBT for EDs (CBT&#x02010;ED, usually 20 sessions) (Traviss&#x02010;Turner, West, and Hill&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Wilson and Zandberg&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The addition of a &#x0201c;guide&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;coach&#x0201d; improves outcomes compared to pure self&#x02010;help, and support is generally provided via 4 to 9 sessions, each lasting 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;min, over 12 to 16&#x02009;weeks. GSH is cost&#x02010;effective as well as clinically effective (K&#x000f6;nig et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Lynch et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and allows for task&#x02010;shifting from highly trained psychological therapists to more junior &#x0201c;coaches&#x0201d; who can provide guided support using a structured protocol and under expert supervision (Davey et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).</p><p>Since 2019, CBT&#x02010;T has provided another CBT&#x02010;based treatment that is quicker than, but comparable in effectiveness to, 20&#x02010;session CBT&#x02010;ED (Waller et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). A systematic review and meta&#x02010;analysis of 10 studies found that 61% of those who start CBT&#x02010;T complete it, and 65% of treatment completers achieve a good outcome (Keegan, Waller, and Wade&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). These results were from studies of patients with a pre&#x02010;treatment Body Mass Index (BMI) &#x0003e;&#x02009;18.5, and so included those with BN and BED but also other forms of other specified feeding or eating disorders (OSFED). Like GSH, CBT&#x02010;T may be delivered by relatively junior therapists and provides opportunities for task shifting as well as cost savings, improved treatment throughput, and a more diverse workforce that is better able to meet the needs of a heterogeneous patient population (Davey et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).</p><p>There has been one study directly comparing GSH to CBT&#x02010;T (Wade, Ghan, and Waller&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). This employed a randomized controlled design to allocate 98 adolescents and adults (&#x02265;&#x02009;15&#x02009;years) to 10 sessions of CBT&#x02010;T (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;46) or 10 sessions of GSH CBT with an emphasis on motivation (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;52). Both treatments were associated with statistically and clinically significant reductions in global ED psychopathology, clinical impairment, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. There were no overall group differences, but moderator analyses found that patients with low motivation to change at pre&#x02010;treatment did better with GSH than with CBT&#x02010;T. Of note, however, this study offered 10 sessions in the GSH condition, which is more than many forms of GSH provide.</p><p>Group psychotherapy for EDs, including group CBT&#x02010;ED, also produces treatment effects that are comparable to those from longer individual therapies (e.g., Grenon et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In current UK treatment guidelines, group CBT&#x02010;ED is recommended as the second &#x02018;step&#x02019; in treatment for BED if GSH is unacceptable, contraindicated, or ineffective after 4&#x02009;weeks (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In contrast, individual CBT&#x02010;ED is recommended for BN if GSH is not possible or effective.</p><p>To date, no studies have directly compared GSH, CBT&#x02010;T, group CBT&#x02010;ED, and individual CBT&#x02010;ED. Evaluating how these different treatments are used, and how they compare to each other, will help improve our understanding of their relative effectiveness and may inform treatment matching. This would have benefits for resource allocation and improving access to effective ED care. While CBT&#x02010;based interventions are the leading evidence&#x02010;based treatment option for binge/purge EDs, there is also evidence for the effectiveness of interpersonal psychotherapy (Hilbert, Hoek, and Schmidt&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Miniati et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and family&#x02010;based interventions for adolescents and emerging adults (Schmidt et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).

FREED consists of a service model and a care package and was developed to provide evidence&#x02010;based early intervention for 16&#x02010; to 25&#x02010;year&#x02010;olds with an ED of less than 3&#x02009;years duration (Schmidt et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The service model focuses on proactive engagement and provides waiting time targets for assessment and treatment, with a central focus on reducing DUED. The care package involves adapting existing evidence&#x02010;based treatments for EDs (including GSH, CBT&#x02010;T, and CBT&#x02010;ED) to the developmental needs of emerging adults with a recent&#x02010;onset ED. This includes an even greater emphasis on early behavioral change, as well as attention to emerging adulthood, transitions (e.g., out of education, into work, in living circumstances), social media/app use, and family involvement (Allen et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Between 2018 and 2023, FREED scaled from 8 to 54 NHS Trusts. FREED Network services provide core, de&#x02010;identified FREED patient data on a quarterly basis. These data are managed by the FREED National Team at King's College London (KCL) and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM), overseen by the SLaM Information Governance Team and with an approved Data Protection Impact Assessment.

Services differed in their processes for collecting questionnaire data and completion rates varied within and across services with high rates of missing data overall (see below). Ideally, patients were asked to complete the EDE&#x02010;Q and CORE&#x02010;10 at assessment, pre&#x02010;treatment, mid&#x02010;treatment, and post&#x02010;treatment. Assessment and pre&#x02010;treatment data points were combined for this research as data were often only available at one of the timepoints. Where both timepoints were available, the assessment measure was retained as the earlier data point.</p></sec></sec><sec id="eat24343-sec-0016"><label>2.4</label><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>All analyses were conducted in SPSS 27.</p><sec id="eat24343-sec-0017"><label>2.4.1</label><title>Treatment type and use</title><p>The types of treatments offered to patients were reported descriptively.

Generalized linear mixed models using negative binomial regression were used to assess for effects of time and treatment group on binge eating and purging episodes/month. Negative binomial regression is suited to count variables (i.e., binge/purge episodes) that are over&#x02010;dispersed due to non&#x02010;normal distribution and a skew towards zero (i.e., as patients stop binge eating/purging).</p><p>Time and treatment group were initially entered as fixed effects before re&#x02010;running models with an interaction effect between time and treatment group. Fixed effects test for overall differences over time and across treatment groups, whereas interaction effects test whether any changes over time differ between the treatment groups (i.e., whether one group showed greater improvements than another). Random effects were included to account for repeated measurement and the clustering of patients within services.</p><p>Models were run without adjusting for baseline variables, and then with baseline age, DUED, and waiting time for treatment (days between referral and treatment) added as covariates. A second set of analyses were run to add number of treatment sessions as a further covariate, to account for treatment dose/completion. Finally, for Global EDE&#x02010;Q scores, CORE&#x02010;10 scores, binge eating episodes, and purging episodes, additional models were run adding baseline BMI as a covariate.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="eat24343-sec-0019"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="eat24343-sec-0020"><label>3.1</label><title>Missing Data</title><p>All participants had information provided regarding ED diagnosis and the type of treatment they received.

Patients who received another psychological therapy also reported significantly more binge eating than patients who received individual CBT&#x02010;ED. The group CBT&#x02010;ED condition showed a marked decrease in binge eating from pre&#x02010; to mid&#x02010;treatment, with an increase in mean binge eating from mid&#x02010; to post&#x02010;treatment. Patients in the GSH, CBT&#x02010;T, and individual CBT&#x02010;ED conditions showed decreases between each time point, while those who received another psychological therapy showed reductions from mid&#x02010; to post&#x02010;treatment only. The pattern of results was similar when adjusting for baseline age, DUED, and waiting time for treatment; when adding number of treatment sessions; and when adding BMI. However, in the adjusted models, binge eating was no longer significantly elevated in the GSH and group CBT&#x02010;ED groups compared to other treatment conditions.

Patients who received group CBT&#x02010;ED also reported higher levels of purging, on average, than those who received GSH. As with binge eating, purging reduced significantly between pre&#x02010; and mid&#x02010;treatment for patients who received GSH, CBT&#x02010;T, group CBT&#x02010;ED, and individual CBT&#x02010;ED, but not for patients who received another psychological therapy. Patients who received group CBT&#x02010;ED then showed a slight increase in purging between mid&#x02010; and post&#x02010;treatment, while other patients experienced stable or reducing purging over this time period (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). This pattern of results remained after adjusting for baseline age, DUED, and waiting time, when adding number of treatment sessions, and when adding baseline BMI. Of these covariates, only age and BMI were significant predictors of purging, with a small negative association between younger age and greater purging (estimate&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.10&#x02010;, <italic toggle="yes">p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0</italic>.001) and between lower BMI and greater purging (estimate&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.04, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>).</p><p>For BMI, there was no statistically significant effect of time, <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>(2,231)&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.35, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.272, but there was a significant effect of treatment group, <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>(4,906)&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.91, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001.

On average, patients who received GSH had higher BMI scores than those who received another treatment (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This pattern of results did not change after adjusting for baseline age, DUED, or waiting time for treatment, but both age (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and DUED (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) predicted BMI significantly. This reflected positive associations between higher age (estimate&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.39) and longer DUED (estimate&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07) and BMI. The pattern of results also remained when adding number of treatment sessions, which predicted BMI significantly (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) with a negative association between higher number of sessions and lower overall BMI (estimate&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.16) (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="eat24343-sec-0023"><label>3.4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>This study compared use of, and outcomes from, GSH, CBT&#x02010;T, group CBT&#x02010;ED, individual CBT&#x02010;ED, and &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; individual psychological therapies for patients with a non&#x02010;underweight binge/purge ED. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare these treatments directly. Results provide insight into how these treatments are used in routine clinical practice and how they perform in a sample of emerging adults presenting with a recent&#x02010;onset ED.</p><p>Current UK treatment guidelines recommend GSH as the first&#x02010;line intervention for BN and BED (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Despite this, only 11% of the current sample received GSH. An additional 24% received 10&#x02010;session CBT&#x02010;T. Patients with a recent&#x02010;onset ED may be particularly well suited to programme&#x02010;led and focused treatments and so this combined rate of 35% appears low. In this study, patients who received GSH and CBT&#x02010;T had similar Global EDE&#x02010;Q and CORE&#x02010;10 anxiety/depression scores compared to patients who received longer CBT&#x02010;ED. Thus, GSH and CBT&#x02010;T were not only offered to patients with &#x02018;mild&#x02019; ED presentations. Purging was less likely to be present in patients who received GSH but binge eating was higher in the GSH group than in other conditions, suggesting greater use with BED versus BN presentations. Interestingly, this group difference in binge eating was not significant after adjusting for covariates, and DUED was positively associated with binge eating, even in this early intervention sample.</p><p>Where GSH and CBT&#x02010;T were offered, they were similarly effective across all outcomes compared to group and individual CBT&#x02010;ED and other longer individual therapies. As this is not a non&#x02010;inferiority trial, the absence of significant difference does not allow us to conclude that these treatments were equivalent. Moreover, we recognize that patients will have been allocated to treatment conditions in non&#x02010;random ways and we are limited in our ability to understand the clinical and service&#x02010;level factors which may have influenced treatment allocations. While ED symptoms were not milder in the GSH and CBT&#x02010;T groups than in other conditions, clinicians often (and understandably) avoid offering programme&#x02010;led and focused treatments to patients with acute suicidality or deliberate self&#x02010;harm, other psychiatric risks, and high physical health risks (e.g., Dalton et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>; Davey et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Patients who received GSH and CBT&#x02010;T are therefore likely to be meaningfully different from those who received other treatments. Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with prior results showing that programme&#x02010;led and focused interventions can be effective with non&#x02010;underweight EDs (e.g., Keegan, Waller, and Wade&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Traviss&#x02010;Turner, West, and Hill&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and add to our understanding of how these treatments are used in varied &#x02018;real world&#x02019; settings.</p><p>Treatment completion rates were comparable across conditions and were high overall (83%) in this early intervention sample. Treatment length did vary, however, and deviated from the standard protocol of 20 sessions of CBT&#x02010;ED for non&#x02010;underweight patients and 10 sessions of CBT&#x02010;T. The mean number of individual CBT&#x02010;ED sessions attended was 11, although with a large range around this (1&#x02013;53 sessions). For group CBT&#x02010;ED the mean number of sessions was 8, equivalent to the mean for CBT&#x02010;T, although again with considerable variability (1&#x02013;26 sessions for group CBT&#x02010;ED and 1&#x02013;20 for CBT&#x02010;T). The relatively low mean session numbers may reflect early intervention patients requiring fewer sessions, on average, to achieve a good outcome than patients with longer&#x02010;standing EDs. The extension of session numbers, in a small number of cases, to more than twice the recommendations for CBT&#x02010;T and CBT&#x02010;ED also speaks to the personalization of treatment via shortening <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> lengthening of treatment length. It is not clear if treatment extensions occurred when prior sessions had not been beneficial or reflected evidence&#x02010;based but personalized practice (e.g., if a patient was experiencing benefits but needed additional time to extend progress, or to navigate life events such as starting university) (Richard&#x02010;Kassar et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Irrespective, these findings arguably add to the case for offering non&#x02010;underweight early intervention patients GSH or CBT&#x02010;T first (unless specifically contraindicated), with longer CBT&#x02010;ED reserved for those patients who do require additional or longer&#x02010;term support. This approach is consistent with existing clinical guidelines (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and our finding that number of treatment sessions did not, overall, predict clinical outcomes. Information on when patients were stepped up to other treatments was variably available in this sample, but in most cases, GSH and CBT&#x02010;T were offered as standalone interventions rather than being part of a stepped or augmented care pathway. This may disadvantage patients who are not able to benefit from focused interventions, while also putting clinicians off from offering these interventions if they are unsure over whether the patient will benefit.</p><p>The primary focus of this study was GSH, CBT&#x02010;T, and CBT&#x02010;ED. Nevertheless, it is interesting to reflect on the 136 patients who received a non&#x02010;CBT&#x02010;based intervention. These patients waited longer for both assessment and treatment than other patients, suggesting additional barriers or delays to engagement with the ED service right from the point of initial referral. They also started treatment with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms, and higher rates of purging, than other patients. As has been found in prior comparisons of CBT&#x02010;ED and non&#x02010;CBT&#x02010;based interventions (e.g., Miniati et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), this group took longer to experience behavioral reductions in ED symptoms than other patients, with no substantial reductions from pre&#x02010; to mid&#x02010;treatment. They did then catch up between mid&#x02010;treatment and post&#x02010;treatment. In contrast, we observed an increase in binge eating (and to a lesser extent purging) from mid to post&#x02010;treatment for patients who received group CBT&#x02010;ED, which was significantly different to the stable or decreasing symptoms seen over this time period in other treatment groups. A prior systematic review found that group psychotherapy for EDs (including group CBT&#x02010;ED) performed comparably to individual therapy (Grenon et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), so our finding was unexpected. With the development of CBT&#x02010;T, services may now offer this in place of group CBT&#x02010;ED and/or be calibrating who is offered CBT&#x02010;ED relative to other treatments. Current UK guidelines also differ in the advice given around CBT&#x02010;ED for BED (where group treatment is recommended as part of a stepped care approach) relative to BN (where group treatment is not specifically advised). Continuing to evaluate group CBT&#x02010;ED relative to GSH, CBT&#x02010;T, and individual CBT&#x02010;ED would help improve understanding of how these treatments compare, and who they are best suited to. It is also unclear if services offered group CBT&#x02010;ED for FREED patients specifically or as a mixed group with FREED and non&#x02010;FREED patients. It is plausible that emerging adults with a recent&#x02010;onset ED would engage differently in an early intervention&#x02010;focused group relative to a group with more diverse ED presentations. This possibility could be investigated via future qualitative and quantitative research.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that 37 patients received brief psychoeducation or motivational interviewing support only. There is growing interest in the potential benefits of single session interventions (SSIs) in mental health generally and EDs specifically (e.g., Schleider, Smith, and Ahuvia&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>) and clinicians offering psychoeducation may benefit from formalized, evidence&#x02010;based protocols in how to provide this support as a standalone intervention. More work is needed in this area, including research on how single session or very brief interventions may sit alongside existing focused treatments like GSH and CBT&#x02010;T. There is some evidence that SSIs can predict subsequent response to treatment, which speaks to the potential for the ED field to move away from stepped care to more personalized augmented treatment decisions based on assessment information plus early response to treatment (Wade&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).</p><p>We found that mean pre&#x02010;treatment BMI was higher in the GSH group than in other conditions. This may correlate with the higher rates of binge eating seen in GSH patients. It is also possible that weight bias plays a role in treatment decisions, such that patients with higher weights are more likely to be offered a programme&#x02010;led intervention than patients with lower weights. This would be consistent with prior research showing that healthcare professionals are less likely to perceive ED symptoms as severe when they're reported by larger bodied individuals, and are more likely to offer programme&#x02010;led or focused treatments to these patients (McEntee, Philip, and Phelan&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). We also found that higher BMI was associated with receiving a lower number of treatment session, on average and across models.</p><p>The possible impact of weight bias could be investigated further as part of research into how decisions are made about treatment provision. Our findings suggest that programme&#x02010;led and focused treatments may be under&#x02010;utilized but we do not have information on factors that influenced treatment decisions. This is an important area for future research, as we know that clinical outcomes can be improved with shorter waiting times (Carter et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and DUED (McClelland et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), but that the demand&#x02010;capacity gap undermines access to timely evidence&#x02010;based care (Kazdin, Fitzsimmons&#x02010;Craft, and Wilfley&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Improving our understanding of when GSH and CBT&#x02010;T are offered, and when not, and when these treatments are effective, and when not, will help to improve treatment matching and optimum use of resources (Davey et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).</p><p>This study has several advantages, including comparison of all evidence&#x02010;based CBT interventions for EDs (GSH, CBT&#x02010;T, CBT&#x02010;ED), consideration of multiple outcomes (depressive/anxiety symptoms as well as ED symptoms), and the use of a large, naturalistic, national sample. A major limitation is the amount of missing data and associated small group sizes for some analyses (particularly for CORE&#x02010;10 scores). This reflects data being collected in routine clinical practice in 54 different NHS Trusts, typically in labor&#x02010;intensive, non&#x02010;automated ways. Data of this type can be described as Flawed Uncertain Proximal and Sparse (FUPS) and are not uncommon in routine healthcare settings (Wolpert and Rutter&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). We acknowledge that results may not generalize to other contexts, that patients will have been allocated to treatments in non&#x02010;random ways, and that replication and extension of our results are important. Improving the quality of routinely collected data is a key challenge for FREED and UK ED services more generally. A new, in&#x02010;process Eating Disorders Clinical Research Network (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/eating-disorders-clinical-research-network" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/eating&#x02010;disorders&#x02010;clinical&#x02010;research&#x02010;network</ext-link>) provides hope for future improvements in data collection. Other limitations of this work include reliance on services accurately reporting the treatments they provided and a lack of corroboration over whether treatments were delivered according to evidence&#x02010;based protocols. For GSH, there was also variability in the type of GSH provided, both in relation to the source of information (book vs. online programme) and the format and number of support sessions offered. We were not in a position to conduct moderator or mediator analyses and do not have data on additional variables which may help to explain why some patients were offered focused interventions and some were not (e.g., baseline self&#x02010;reported motivation to change, comorbid diagnoses). We draw on data collected before, during, and after the COVID&#x02010;19 pandemic and so some patients may have had their treatment disrupted by the need to pause treatment and/or move treatment online. We have previously shown that FREED Network referrals increased after the pandemic, although this reflected increased referrals for AN rather than for non&#x02010;underweight presentations (Hyam et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Others have shown that ED therapies can be effectively delivered online, with results comparable to those from face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face therapy provision (e.g., Raykos et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), but also that ED symptom severity may have increased in response to public health lockdown measures (Devoe et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eat24343-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Continued evaluation of ED treatment effects post&#x02010;pandemic will help to extend our results.</p><p>Despite these limitations, this study provides new and novel data on how GSH, CBT&#x02010;T, CBT&#x02010;ED, and other ED therapies are used in routine practice and how outcomes from these treatments compare. Results suggest that GSH and CBT&#x02010;T perform comparably to longer forms of CBT&#x02010;ED, despite patients starting with similar levels of ED psychopathology and receiving fewer sessions. However, only 35% of patients were offered one of these interventions. Future studies should consider when GSH and CBT&#x02010;T are offered, and when they are not, in order to improve use of these focused interventions with patients who may benefit from them.</p></sec></sec><sec id="eat24343-sec-0028"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>
