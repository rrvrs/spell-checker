Seventeen patients diagnosed with moderate chronic periodontitis with bilateral nearly symmetrical sites having a pocket depth of &#x02265;4 mm but &#x02264;6 mm were included in the study. A total of 60 sites were randomly divided into two groups, with 30 sites in each group: Group A, scaling and root planing (SRP) with subgingival delivery of liquorice gel, and Group B, SRP with subgingival delivery of placebo gel. The clinical parameters, plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), samples were collected at baseline, 15th day, and 30th day after gel placement.

The disease is associated with microbial plaque and contributing factors, including exaggerated immune response, genetic predisposition, and environmental factors [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The management of periodontitis concentrates on eradicating supragingival and subgingival plaque and calculus, intending to restore the healthy state of oral tissues. However, the complete elimination of periodontal pathogens may not be achieved by nonsurgical procedures alone due to the unique characteristics of pathogens that reside in deep and inaccessible areas. Therefore, it appears reasonable to combine mechanical periodontal therapy with the administration of systemic or local chemotherapeutic agents.</p><p>To avoid undesirable adverse effects of systemic antimicrobials, Goodson et al. first proposed the concept of controlled local drug delivery of drugs in periodontal pockets for treating periodontitis [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Numerous pharmacological agents have already been used, including doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline, metronidazole, chlorhexidine, alendronate, simvastatin, and others. Recently, herbal extracts containing phytochemicals responsible for the desired anti&#x02011;inflammatory and antimicrobial effects have been used in modern medicine [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Liquorice (<italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>), commonly known as sweet wood, is indigenous to the Mediterranean and a few areas of Asia.&#x000a0;The term&#x000a0;<italic>Glycyrrhiza</italic> originates from the ancient Greek words glycos, meaning sweet, and rhiza, meaning root, also known as "mulaithi" in north India.&#x000a0;The bioactive components found in liquorice have shown anti-inflammatory [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], antimicrobial [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>],&#x000a0;and anti-adherence [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] effects that can help prevent and treat periodontal disease as well. Key bioactive ingredients in liquorice extract are glycyrrhizin, glabridin, licoricidin, licochalcone A, and licorisoflavan A.</p><p>In vitro, studies suggested that liquorice prevents cyclooxygenase activity, potentially leading to inhibition of various components in the inflammatory cascade, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and reactive oxygen species at the inflammatory site and, thus, may reduce the inflammatory markers at the site of infection [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>PGE2, an arachidonic acid metabolite, induces vasodilatation, increases vascular permeability, and has multiple effects on different cell types in the periodontium [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A reduction in PGE2 level in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) indicates a reduction in inflammation and, thus, reduces bone resorption. Therefore, it can serve as a valuable indicator of periodontitis progression.</p><p>Based on this background, the present study will evaluate the efficacy of subgingivally delivered liquorice gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) on clinical parameters and prostaglandin E2 level in chronic periodontitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A prospective, randomized, comparative, single-blind, split-mouth study was conducted in the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dental Sciences, Uttar Pradesh University of Medical Sciences, Saifai, Etawah, UP, India. The study was conducted over 15 months, from January 2023 to April 2024, after getting approval from the Uttar Pradesh University of Medical Sciences Ethical Committee (approval number: 38/2022-23) on 19 patients with 64 sites having moderate chronic periodontitis. Out of these, two patients with four sites were lost to follow-up. The written informed consent was obtained from each patient after explaining the treatment procedure before the commencement of the study. The sample size was calculated based on variation in gingival score change from baseline to last follow-up in two study groups [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Type II errors may be termed as "statistical power," i.e., having a 10% type II error is the same as the study had 90% "power." Therefore, based on this formula, 30 sites in each group were sufficient for conducting the study with a power analysis of 90%. The study was registered at ctri.nic.in with CTRI no. CTRI/2024/05/067674.</p><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</p><p>The inclusion criteria include patients aged 25 to 50 years with moderate chronic periodontitis with bilateral nearly symmetrical sites with a pocket depth of &#x02265;4 mm but &#x02264;6 mm. Systemically healthy patients were also enrolled in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient after explaining the treatment procedure before the commencement of the study.</p><p>Medically compromised patients, smokers, pregnant or lactating mothers, and patients who had undergone periodontal therapy or used antibiotics/analgesics/anti-inflammatory drugs in the last six months were excluded from the study.</p><p>Study design</p><p>A split-mouth, parallel, randomized, controlled clinical trial with single blinding was conducted. Sites meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two groups using the flip-coin method. Group A underwent SRP with the subgingival placement of liquorice gel, prepared in the Department of Pharmacognosy with a 0.1% liquorice extract concentration. Group B received SRP with the subgingival placement of a placebo gel, also prepared in the Department of Pharmacognosy, containing a polymeric base.

Clinical parameters were plaque index (PI) by Silness and Loe [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], measured using a two-tone disclosing solution (AlphaPlac&#x000ae;); gingival index (GI) by Silness and Loe [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; probing pocket depth (PPD), measured using a&#x000a0;UNC-15 periodontal probe; and clinical attachment level (CAL), measured using a customized occlusal stent from the lower border of the stent to the base of the pocket. The biochemical parameter was PGE2&#x000a0;levels, measured using an ELISA kit (Elabscience&#x000ae; Co. Ltd., USCN, Wuhan).</p><p>Preparation of the liquorice extract</p><p>Liquorice root powder was mixed with 70% ethanol and left for 72 hours at ambient temperature. After 72 hours, filtration was done using Whitman&#x02019;s filter paper. The resultant clear filtrate was dried in a hot air oven to obtain a uniform, semi-solid, dark brown-colored liquorice extract. A concentration of 0.1 mg/ml of ethanol extract of liquorice was utilized to develop a local drug delivery gel, with Carbopol 940 serving as a gel base as a mucoadhesive polymer.</p><p>Preparation of the liquorice gel</p><p>To prepare liquorice gel, 4 gm of Carbopol 940 was dissolved in 80 milliliters of water and constantly stirred for 30 minutes. Subsequently, 8 mg of liquorice extract was added and thoroughly mixed. The mixing was continued for one hour until a semisolid, homogeneous, light brown-colored gel was obtained. The pH of the formulated gel was 3.08, with adequate viscosity. The consistency of the formulations was investigated by pressing a small amount of gel between the index finger and thumb.</p><p>Preparation of the placebo gel</p><p>To prepare the placebo gel, 0.5 gm of Carbopol 940 was dissolved in 10 milliliters of distilled water and constantly stirred for 30 minutes. To ensure proper blinding of participants, the color additives were added to transform the initially prepared clear, transparent gel into a light brown-colored gel.</p><p>Procedure</p><p>After the selection of patients, a customized occlusal stent was prepared. Baseline GCF samples were collected from both group sites before oral hygiene instructions and SRP. After drying and isolating the area, the end of the filter paper (Periopaper&#x000ae; strip) was inserted within the selected pocket sites. GCF was collected intrasulcularly until the absorbing paper strip became wet. The GCF volume collected by this method was 0-1.2 &#x003bc;l per strip. The strips suspected to be contaminated with blood and saliva were excluded from the study. The collected GCF samples were immediately transferred to sterilized Eppendorf tubes containing 100 &#x000b5;l phosphate buffered saline 10X solution and stored at -4&#x000ba;C in the refrigerator, transported in a thermo-insulated flask having ice cubes to the biochemistry lab and stored at -40&#x000ba;C to keep the loss of reactivity of biomarkers to a minimum. After the collection of GCF, all the clinical parameters were recorded. Full mouth SRP was performed within two to three days using ultrasonic and manual instruments, followed by subgingival placement of prepared liquorice&#x000a0;gel on the same visit using 30-gauze side vent irrigation needles in the selected pocket sites at varying depths until the resistance was felt. Similarly, the prepared placebo gel was placed subgingivally in the selected pocket sites on the same visit. The sites were then covered by periodontal dressing (Coe-PakTM). Patients were given post-operative instructions and recalled after seven days for removal of periodontal dressing. Biochemical and clinical parameters were re-evaluated on the 15th day and 30th day after gel placement.

The host response to pathogenic microorganisms involves a sophisticated interplay of cellular and humoral components of the immune system, which interact with each other. Host response is orchestrated by various biologically active compounds like cytokines that are pivotal in regulating the immune system, causing tissue destruction and healing [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Among various pro-inflammatory cytokines, PGE2 emerges as a particularly potent mediator found in abundance at sites of inflammation. PGE2 exerts multiple effects on different cell types in the periodontium, such as gingival fibroblasts, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and immune cells. It triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-8, by gingival fibroblasts and macrophages, which can further amplify the inflammatory response and cause tissue damage [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The levels of PGE2 in GCF exhibit a direct association with the presence of periodontal inflammation and impending tissue destruction [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, targeting PGE2 or its receptors may be a potential strategy for regulating inflammation and preventing tissue destruction in periodontitis.</p><p>It seems reasonable to combine mechanical periodontal therapy with the local delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to enhance the effectiveness of SRP, reduce patient discomfort, and optimize treatment outcomes. The usage of herbal agents for the treatment of periodontal disease is considered an intriguing alternative to conventional antibiotics due to their higher benefit-to-lower risk ratio. Natural products like neem, propolis, curcumin, etc. are preferred because they are safe, economical, and more effective. [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Notably, liquorice is one such herb that is derived from dried, unpeeled stolons and roots of <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> and <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>. Glycyrrhetinic acid, a constituent of liquorice extract, resembles the structure of glucocorticoids, thereby exhibiting steroid-like anti-inflammatory activity. This is due to inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity, an enzyme crucial in various inflammatory processes [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].&#x000a0;Hasan et al. [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found that liquorice diminishes the synthesis of nitric oxide, PGE2, and IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophage cells. Bodet et al. [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] documented that liquorice extract exhibits robust anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting the periodontopathogen LPS-induced IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&#x003b1; responses of macrophages.</p><p>Henceforth, the present study aimed at knowing the anti-inflammatory effect of subgingivally delivered liquorice gel when used as an adjunct to SRP in inflamed periodontal tissues in chronic periodontitis patients by measuring changes in clinical parameters and PGE2 levels in GCF.</p><p>The liquorice and placebo gel used in this study were prepared as per the protocols specified by Khan et al.&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] To increase the substantivity of liquorice at the target site, Carbopol was employed as a carrier to deliver the antimicrobial agent in a controlled manner and increase its substantivity. Carbopols can expand to 1000 times their original size in water to form a large adhesive area with mucin [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The gel becomes thicker with the swelling of the polymer, limiting water penetration and resulting in controlled drug release.</p><p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of glycyrrhetinic acid for periodontopathogens was estimated to be 8 mg/L to 16 mg/L. [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Therefore, in the present study, liquorice gel was prepared with a concentration of 0.1% liquorice extract to achieve a MIC of 16 mg/L. the optimal efficacy of liquorice is observed within 15 days, with the sustained effect lasting up to 30 days. Later, the overlapping effect of oral hygiene as a confounding factor is observed. Thus, data collection intervals were set at baseline, 15th day, and 30th day after gel placement [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Statistical analysis has shown a significant reduction in PI and GI over time in both groups. This improvement could result from SRP aiming to reduce the microflora and their toxic products and the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties of liquorice gel. These findings were similar to other studies by Ali and Mohammed [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], who also found a decrease in PI and GI over time in SRP with liquorice mouth rinse than SRP alone. Similarly, Sharma et al. [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Jain et al. [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] also found a decrease in GI score post-treatment with liquorice mouth rinse in both groups. Furthermore, Madan et al. [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] found a similar result regarding a decrease in gingival inflammation using <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> gum paint.</p><p>The results of PPD and CAL were statistically significant in both groups at each time interval. On comparing the two groups, the results were statistically significant, with a significantly greater reduction observed in Group A than in Group B on the 30th day. Similarly, Shivprasad et al. [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] also found more PPD reduction and CAL gain in the liquorice group than in the control group.</p><p>The reduction in PGE2 levels on the 30th day could be due to the inhibitory effect of liquorice on COX-2, which results in decreased synthesis of PGE2 [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As discussed, liquorice is believed to show its maximum potency by 15 days, and the effect continues till 30 days. Here also, the reduction in inflammation, both clinically and biochemically, was appreciated on the 30th day.</p><p>Limitations and future prospects</p><p>The limitation of the current study is the small sample size, which can reduce its generalizability. The subgingival placement of gels may result in inappropriate retention of the drug for the desired period of time in the selected sites. Prolonged follow-up intervals are required to establish the outcome of this study conclusively.</p><p>Choi [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] indicated the enhancement of osteoblast function by glabridin (a constituent of liquorice), preventing osteoporosis and inflammatory bone diseases by reducing TNF-&#x003b1;-induced production of PGE2 and nitric oxide in osteoblasts. Further studies can be conducted to evaluate the role of liquorice in bone regeneration and regulation of localized bone destruction associated with inflammatory bone diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of the present study conclude that subgingivally delivered liquorice gel can potentially reduce inflammation in inflamed periodontal tissues. Therefore, it can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent to provide an adjunctive effect to SRP in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. Also, as an herbal agent, it is a cost-effective, easily available new treatment modality with minimum adverse effects that can be considered in daily practice. Therefore, liquorice gel can be used as an effective local drug delivery agent for the treatment of chronic periodontitis. To establish this fact, further research on a larger sample size is required to better understand its specific role in the management of periodontitis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Dr. Padmini Shukla, Assistant Professor at the Department of Pharmacy, UPUMS, Saifai, for her assistance in developing liquorice and placebo gel.
