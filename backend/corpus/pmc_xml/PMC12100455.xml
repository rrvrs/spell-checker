This is done using different types of contraceptives, including hormonal methods, barrier methods, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and natural methods [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Barrier methods, such as male and female condoms, block sperm from reaching the egg and also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Intrauterine devices (IUDs), which can be either hormonal or copper-based, can also be placed inside the uterus and act as a long-term way to prevent fertilization [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hormonal contraceptives, like birth control pills or implants, work by changing a woman's hormones to stop ovulation [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Other natural methods of contraception include avoiding sex during fertile days, the lactational amenorrhea method, which delays ovulation during breastfeeding, and the withdrawal method, where the man pulls out before ejaculation [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Family planning (FP) is a key strategy to improve women&#x02018;s reproductive health and reinforce women&#x02018;s autonomy through informed choices about their sexual and reproductive needs and modern contraceptive use is an important indicator of reproductive health and FP program success [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The Nigerian government has implemented several policies and programs aimed at improving access to and uptake of family planning services. The Nigeria Family Planning Blueprint (Scale-Up Plan 2020-2024) aimed to achieve a modern Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (mCPR) target of 27% by the year 2024, outlining strategies to increase contraceptive use and reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancies [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Unintended pregnancy poses a wide array of health risks for both the mother and the child&#x000a0;such as malnutrition, illness, abuse, neglect, and even death. It can also reduce educational and&#x000a0;employment opportunities and increase poverty, which can go on to affect many generations&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>However, despite these efforts, the country continues to face significant challenges, with a substantial proportion of women experiencing unmet needs for contraception and high rates of unintended pregnancies [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. An estimated 218 million women have an unmet need for modern contraceptives, leading to 121 million unintended pregnancies annually [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The burden is particularly heavy in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 66% of unintended pregnancies occur [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Osun State, located in south-western Nigeria, reflects the broader reproductive health challenges in the country. The state experiences high fertility rates as a result of significant unmet needs for contraception and a considerable burden of unintended pregnancy. Socio-cultural norms, including religious beliefs, myths about contraceptives and gender norms further hinder the uptake of family planning services [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>An in-depth understanding of the barriers to uptake of family planning services among women of reproductive age will provide valuable insights for collaboration with local communities, religious groups, and women's organizations, which can help break down cultural barriers and promote awareness about family planning options, leading to increased uptake of family planning services. Therefore, this study aims to assess the perceived barriers to the uptake of family planning services among women of reproductive age in Osun State, Nigeria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was carried out in Osun State, located in southwest Nigeria. The study employed a qualitative study design using Focus&#x000a0;Group Discussions (FGDs).&#x000a0;The study population was women of reproductive age, 15-49 years old.</p><p>Inclusion criteria</p><p>Inclusion criteria include women of reproductive age, 15-49 years old, irrespective of their marital status residing in the selected local government areas within Osun State, women who had past history of ever being pregnant irrespective of the outcome of the pregnancy and women with or without current contraceptive use at the time of study.</p><p>Exclusion criteria</p><p>Exclusion criteria include women who were less than 15 or over 49 years old during the study period and women who were residing outside the selected local government areas within Osun State during the study period.</p><p>Participants were selected using a multi-stage sampling technique; at the first stage, two local government areas were randomly selected (balloting method) from each of the three senatorial districts in Osun State. At the second stage, two high-volume markets were selected from each of the local government areas using random selection (balloting method), making 12 markets. The selected markets include Odo-ori and Oja-oba markets in Iwo Local Government, Oja-oba and Ola markets in Ejigbo Local Government, Ode-omu and Olufi markets in Ayedaade Local Government, Igbona market and Anoye market in Olorunda Local Government, Oke-ila and Ora markets in Ifedayo Local Government, and Iragbiji and Iree markets in Boripe Local Government. At the third stage, participants were selected by purposive sampling method from each market after the market women had been screened for eligibility criteria.</p><p>One focus&#x000a0;group discussion (one group consisting of five participants) was done in each market, giving a total of 12 focus group discussions with 60 participants. A key in-depth interview was also carried out with the permanent secretary of the Osun State Ministry of Health and the Family Planning program coordinator for Osun State.&#x000a0;Data was collected by doctors and public health professionals from 8th to 29th of April 2024. Separate interview guides were carefully designed for Focus Group Discussions and Key Informants to delve into the themes related to the socio-ecological model, health belief model, diffusion of innovation theory, and feminist theory, which together formed the conceptual framework of the study. The primary goal was to create a comprehensive guide that would facilitate in-depth discussions. To achieve this, open-ended questions were designed to elicit detailed responses while being mindful of ethical considerations. It was ensured that the questions were sensitive to the participants' privacy, consent, and overall well-being and respected the ethical principles of research, including confidentiality and voluntary participation. Interviews were primarily conducted in the local language or the language preferred by the respondents. All qualitative data were recorded, and notes were taken. At the end of each field day, the data were backed up on the study computer to minimize the risk of data loss.</p><p>Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Adeleke University Review Ethical Committee and Osun State Health Research Ethics Committee (OSHREC) in the Ministry of Health.&#x000a0;The study ensured that the sensitive data records were meticulously anonymized using unique identifiers, such as pseudo names, to safeguard the privacy and confidentiality of the individuals associated with the information.</p><p>All discussions from key informant interviews and focus group discussions were recorded. Thematic content analysis was adopted in the analysis of the data based on grounded theory. The interviews were transcribed, and then the transcripts were read and reread for emerging themes. These themes were later re-organised into themes and subthemes based on the centrality of ideas within each category. The data was coded and analyzed using ATLAS.ti (Version 24) qualitative data analysis software.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 62 participants were recruited, 60 were involved in a focused group discussion, while two were involved in a key in-depth interview&#x000a0;(Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Sociodemographic Characteristics of Participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sociodemographic Characteristics (N=62)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Frequency</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Percentage</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (in years)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15-19</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20-24</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.0</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">25-29</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30-34</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.9</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">35-39</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">40-44</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.1</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">45-49</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Level of education</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primary/Arabic</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">35.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Secondary</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">28</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">45.2</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tertiary</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Religion</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0; &#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0; &#x000a0;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Christianity</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">32</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Islam</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.4</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Barriers to the uptake of family planning services</p><p>Four major themes emerged from the discussion on evaluating barriers and challenges to the uptake of family planning services in the study area.

And here is the madam now, to take up coming to the facility and the provider now says, you have to pay a token to get the consumables they claim to be off, but I was told it was free, and so here now it is no more free, so the clients can decide to go away and thereby reducing the, the uptake.

However, some of these services were usually taken without the husband&#x02019;s knowledge as they stated that it was possible for a man to not cooperate with his wife taking it. One of the women mentioned that a man was worried that family planning services could make his wife infertile&#x000a0;(Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>System factors</p><p>One of the primary system challenges is related to the shortage of personnel. The Ministry of Health staff expressed concern about how it has been hard to replace people who were retiring from work because of people relocating outside the country. Another issue of concern had to do with the availability of family planning materials, where the requisite materials were not sufficient to meet the needs of people. Also, there were remote communities that were often hard to reach because of their distance, and finally, there was the issue of family planning mobilisers who ask women to pay for accessing family planning materials, which are actually free, and thus put off the women from family planning. Women in the FGD discussions further talked about the unpleasant attitude of healthcare providers, which usually discourages them from seeking family planning services&#x000a0;(Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>Religious and socio-cultural barriers against family planning</p><p>Participants spoke about several norms and beliefs that could militate against women&#x02019;s adoption of family planning services.</p><p>Most of these reasons were based on rumours, false beliefs and largely ignorance about family planning and how it worked.&#x000a0;Also, some of the women also mentioned that family planning can lead to being stigmatized by others and that it could also counter their religious practices, such as when a Muslim woman is unable to observe her religious duties because of spotting. One of the most common ideologies was that sex education and subsequently adoption of family planning could promote promiscuity among women because they now know how to avoid getting pregnant while sleeping around or engaging in extra-marital affairs&#x000a0;(Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>Another cultural norm was that men have control over women&#x02019;s bodies, and they could decide whether they should use contraception or not. Also, one of the women spoke about rivalry and jealousy in a polygamous home that may make women prioritise having children over uptaking family planning, irrespective of the existing number of children in the family. Other norms were associated with the role of religious institutions that encourage women to have unlimited children and also oppose family planning (Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Family planning is important for improving health and well-being, but many people face challenges in using it. These challenges can be personal, related to a spouse, influenced by society, or caused by problems in the healthcare system.</p><p>One of the most significant barriers identified was the fear of health complications associated with family planning methods. Many women expressed concerns about side effects such as irregular menstrual cycles, weight gain, prolonged bleeding, and potential damage to reproductive health. These fears were reinforced by personal experiences, other people&#x02019;s experience and misinformation. Similarly, Adedini and Omisakin [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported similar concerns in their study among adolescents and young women. Some women believed that contraceptive methods, particularly hormonal ones, could lead to infertility, preventing them from conceiving in the future, as noted in recent studies, where women expressed concerns about their future ability to have children after using birth control [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Education and counseling can help people have a correct understanding of the benefits and potential side effects of family planning.</p><p>Spousal disapproval was also found to play an important role in contraceptive uptake. A husband&#x02019;s opinion about family planning can affect a woman&#x02019;s decision to use contraceptives. In some families, men make most of the decisions, and if they do not support birth control, their wives may not use it [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A recent study found that women who felt unsupported by their partners were more likely to avoid or discontinue contraceptive use [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In some cases, partners worry about potential side effects on their wives or see contraception as unnecessary if they prefer larger families [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Studies show that involving men in family planning education can help change their views and increase contraceptive use [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Cultural beliefs and societal norms were also identified as major barriers to family planning. Many misconceptions and rumors about contraceptives deterred women from using them. For instance, some respondents believed that family planning could lead to permanent infertility or cause prolonged bleeding. Others cited religious reasons, stating that spotting caused by contraceptives interfered with religious observances, particularly among Muslim women. Additionally, societal stigma surrounding family planning made some women reluctant to seek services, as they feared being labeled as promiscuous or irresponsible. Similarly, the study of Isa et al.&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] revealed similar concerns about violating cultural or religious beliefs. Biney et al.&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] also highlighted the role of societal acceptance in patriarchal settings. This highlights the need for culturally sensitive health education programs that work with community leaders and religious institutions to dispel myths and encourage informed decision-making.</p><p>Problems in the healthcare system can also make it hard for people to use family planning. Some clinics do not have enough contraceptive supplies, so women may not get the method they want. The cost of contraceptives is another issue, especially for people who cannot afford them. Some women also avoid family planning services because they feel healthcare workers judge them or do not respect their privacy [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Addressing these systemic issues requires targeted interventions such as strengthening healthcare workforce capacity, ensuring the availability of contraceptives, enforcing free service policies, and training providers on respectful and patient-centered care.</p><p>The strength of the study lies in the engagement of the Ministry of Health and Family Planning officials, which gave the first insight into the system factors affecting family planning. This&#x000a0;can help to inform policymakers and other stakeholders. However, the study used a small sample size within six local governments in Osun State and therefore has limited generalizability of findings beyond Osun State.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this study have important implications for public health programs and policies aimed at improving family planning uptake. The identified barriers - health concerns, spousal disapproval, system factors, and religious and socio-cultural influences - reveal the complexity of challenges that women face when trying to access contraceptive services.&#x000a0;Health system issues such as shortages of trained personnel, unavailability of materials, and unofficial charges by healthcare workers contribute to poor service delivery and discourage use. These findings suggest the need for strengthening the healthcare system through better staffing, improved supply chains, and enhanced accountability.&#x000a0;Furthermore, the presence of misinformation and fear of side effects highlights the need for targeted health education that addresses myths, promotes awareness, and encourages informed decision-making. Spousal disapproval and gender power imbalances were also notable barriers, indicating the importance of involving men in reproductive health discussions and promoting shared decision-making within households. Programs should also focus on empowering women to make autonomous choices about their reproductive health.</p><p>Religious and socio-cultural beliefs emerged as powerful influences, with stigmatization, fears of promoting promiscuity, and religious restrictions being commonly cited. This underscores the importance of engaging religious and community leaders in sensitization campaigns, as well as developing culturally respectful communication strategies. Addressing these deeply rooted norms will be essential for increasing acceptance and use of family planning services.&#x000a0;This study serves as a baseline for future research which includes exploring the effectiveness of community-based interventions, strategies for male involvement, the role of cultural and religious leaders, and the impact of empowerment initiatives on women&#x02019;s reproductive choices. Overall, the study provides a valuable foundation for designing more effective and inclusive family planning programs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Data for this study is available upon reasonable request from corresponding author.</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
