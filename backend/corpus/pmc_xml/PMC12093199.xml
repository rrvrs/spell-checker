Unaddressed, these issues can lead to the attrition of the workforce. Retention of speech and language therapists (SLTs) is an ongoing concern, but little is known about the relationship between SLT wellbeing and their workplaces.</p></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0020"><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of the present study were therefore to: (1) Explore the levels of job satisfaction and general wellbeing of SLTs working clinically. (2) Describe the occupational environments of SLTs working clinically. (3) Investigate the relationship between job design and wellbeing outcomes. (4) Establish whether job satisfaction and general psychosocial wellbeing levels were consistent over time. (5) Explore whether personal changes/changes to work made by participants over a 3&#x02010;month period impacted their job satisfaction and/or general wellbeing.</p></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0030"><title>Method</title><p>All SLTs practising clinically in the UK were eligible to participate. Participants were recruited via selective sampling (advertising in Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists publications) and snowballing (using social media). A longitudinal study, using an online survey at two time points (P1 and P2), approximately 3&#x000a0;months apart, measured work stressors of SLTs, job satisfaction and general wellbeing, using the Speech&#x02010;language Pathologist Stress Inventory, Generic Job Satisfaction Survey and General Health Questionnaire&#x02010;28 (GHQ&#x02010;28). Relationships between job types, wellbeing and subsequent changes were analysed using multivariate analysis of variance.</p></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0040"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 632 participants at P1, 98% were women, 95% were white and the average age was 38.7 years. Ninety&#x02010;one percent were working in England, and 85% were organisationally employed. At P1, 53.3% of participants who completed the GHQ&#x02010;28 reported anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms of stress and social dysfunction. Those in high&#x02010;demand, low&#x02010;control, and low&#x02010;support (&#x02018;Isostrain&#x02019;) jobs (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 105) had the lowest job satisfaction (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001, partial <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b7;</italic>

Psychosocial risks are embedded within work organisation, suggesting that employers and managers of SLTs consider the overall psychosocial design of jobs, with a view to improving retention. The use of a step&#x02010;by&#x02010;step risk assessment and intervention approach is recommended. Further research may corroborate the results and ensure better psychosocial risk management.</p></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0060"><title>WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS</title><p>

It is essential that the voices of SLTs who are primarily clinical are heard and used to inform this appraisal; collaboration between managers and clinicians is necessary for success in this endeavour.</p></list-item></list>

Fostering their wellbeing is therefore good for them, good for the organisations where they work and good for service users. According to the World Health Organization, health care workers are at risk of occupational stress, burnout and fatigue due to time pressures, a lack of control over work tasks, long working hours and a lack of support (WHO <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>). Individual efforts, such as attending yoga or owning a pet, have been associated with better wellbeing (Alexander <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; McConnell et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, occupational wellbeing is the responsibility of both the employee and the employer. Employers have the ability to design favourable workplaces for health workers, including SLTs; it is therefore incumbent on them to manage the possible causes of stress identified by the WHO (<xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>). Further research into the relationship between working as an SLT and wellbeing is necessary. The purpose of the present study was to explore this relationship, using a longitudinal design to allow measurement of the effect that personal changes (e.g., practicing mindfulness), and/or workplace&#x02010;based changes might have on wellbeing.</p><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0080"><label>1.1</label><title>Theoretical Models</title><p>The term &#x02018;wellbeing&#x02019; deserves definition: In addition to the physical (biological) elements of health, the Biopsychosocial (BPS) model (Engel <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>) includes the psychological (e.g., anxiety) and social (e.g., feeling isolated) components of wellbeing. The way that work contributes to these elements of wellbeing is described in the Job Demand Control Support (JDCS) model (Johnson and Hall <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Karasek <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>). The model has been used extensively in studies investigating the psychosocial work experience (H&#x000e4;usser et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Within the JDCS model, psychological demand is conceptualised as workload. Control is comprised of &#x02018;decision latitude&#x02019; (autonomy) and &#x02018;skill discretion&#x02019; (a variety of work tasks providing opportunities to utilise different skills and control over which specific skills to use to accomplish tasks). Finally, support refers to work&#x02010;related social support from both coworkers and supervisors/managers.</p><p>The principal prediction of the JDCS model is that high psychological demands with low control will result in a &#x02018;high strain&#x02019; job, associated with increased stress, decreased job satisfaction, and exhaustion and depression (Karasek <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>). High&#x02010;strain jobs are also potentially associated with physical outcomes, for example, an increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to higher blood pressure and raised serum cholesterol (Karasek and Theorell <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). In addition to the &#x02018;high strain&#x02019; job, Karasek (<xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>) proposed three more outcomes of the demand&#x02013;control relationship. Firstly, he posited that combining high demand <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> high control would result in an &#x02018;active job&#x02019;, where learning and motivation are optimised, and job satisfaction is high. Secondly, jobs with low demand and low control would result in &#x02018;passive jobs&#x02019;, associated with low satisfaction, and finally, those with low demands and high control would lead to &#x02018;low strain&#x02019; jobs. Support (or the lack thereof) serves to either buffer the impact of demands or exacerbate those demands. Jobs with good support are classified as being &#x02018;collective&#x02019;, while those with limited support are &#x02018;isolated&#x02019;. Circumstances characterised by both high strain and high isolation are labelled &#x02018;Iso&#x02010;strain jobs&#x02019;, and this job type is posited as being the most detrimental to wellbeing. The JDCS model is presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jlcd70046-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="jlcd70046-fig-0001"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>The job demand&#x02010;control&#x02010;support model (Johnson and Hall <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JLCD-60-0-g005" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-1"/></fig></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0090"><label>1.2</label><title>Health Worker Wellbeing</title><p>The WHO's (<xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>) statement regarding workplace risks to healthcare practitioner wellbeing is supported by research reporting the occupational and mental health of these workers. Allied health professionals have been reported to experience psychological distress due to high demands and low support (Bonsaken et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), and targeting job control can improve job satisfaction and mental health in nurses (Elliott et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Across the limited extant literature on SLT wellbeing, insights into two areas are provided: the job satisfaction of SLTs, and the stress/burnout that they experience resulting from their work.</p><p>Research has produced mixed findings regarding levels of SLT job satisfaction. Although some studies have reported average SLT job satisfaction (Blood et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2002a</xref>), others have found low satisfaction for &#x0201c;operating conditions&#x0201d; (Kalkhoff and Collins <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, p. 172), and an intention to leave the profession due to a lack of job satisfaction (Heritage et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Factors contributing to low levels of job satisfaction have included unmanageable workloads (Smith&#x02010;Randolph and Johnson <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). However, reporting regarding the relationship between job satisfaction and caseload size has been mixed. Blood et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2002a</xref>) reported a negative correlation between the two, but Kalkhoff and Collins (<xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) found that caseload size did not predict satisfaction.</p><p>Although some studies have described low levels of SLT stress (Blood et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2002b</xref>; Blood et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2002c</xref>); burnout has been variably reported as being present in 99.7% (Kasbi et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and 51% (Kaegi et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) of SLTs, depicting some variation across different settings. Stress and burnout have been associated with limited autonomy and a lack of professional support (LPS) (Bruschini, et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Blood et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2002b</xref>). Previous studies, however, have not taken a holistic view of how job design and the combination/interaction of job features is linked to SLT wellbeing, possibly explaining conflicting findings around wellbeing. A systematic review of wellbeing, job satisfaction and burnout in SLTs by Ewen et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) included 17 studies and concluded that there is a need for more theoretically driven studies. Furthermore, not enough longitudinal research has been carried out.</p><p>The aims of the present study were therefore to:

Inclusion criteria were therefore (a) qualified SLTs working in the UK, who were (b) practising clinically.</p></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0140"><label>2.4</label><title>Recruitment</title><p>To encourage candid responses about work experiences, potential participants were contacted independent of their employing organisations. Failure to procure a membership list of the profession prohibited random sampling, meaning that selective sampling combined with snowballing was used. This form of nonprobability sampling is potentially susceptible to bias, which may threaten the generalisability of findings. However, it is appropriate when an exercise aims to gather information to describe a specific group, and a population listing (or in this case membership list) is not available. In January 2018, an article was published in &#x02018;Bulletin&#x02019;, the professional magazine published by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT, the professional body for SLTs in the UK), describing the study and providing contact details for the primary researcher. Following this, respondents (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 68) were emailed a link to the questionnaire. In addition, 56 of the 116 Clinical Excellence Networks (CENs) in the UK were emailed with information about the study and a link to the questionnaire (60 CENs with National Health Service email addresses were not contacted, as NHS Health Research Authority approval was not sought for this study). Following this, &#x02018;passive&#x02019; recruitment was used, through publication of the link to the questionnaire via the following web&#x02010;based channels: the RCSLT e&#x02010;Research newsletter; the online Association of Speech and Language Therapists in Independent Practice<xref rid="jlcd70046-note-0001" ref-type="fn">1</xref> forum (available to all ASLTIP members) and the Independent Practitioners in Speech and Language Therapy<xref rid="jlcd70046-note-0002" ref-type="fn">2</xref> Yahoo Group. Finally, social media was used. A direct message was sent via X (then Twitter) to UK&#x02010;based SLTs who followed the primary researcher. A general public tweet was not sent, as this risked the questionnaire being available to non&#x02010;SLTs. Seven weeks after the survey was initially made available, further funding was procured, and an advertisement for the study was published in the RCSLT Bulletin in June 2018. In total, the initial survey was available to SLTs from 16 April 2018 to 18 July 2018 for the first phase (P1). In September 2018, the second questionnaire was emailed to the 480 participants who had agreed, at P1, to complete a follow&#x02010;up survey. Of these, three returned automatic messages stating that the person in question was no longer in post. A further 22 returned &#x02018;undeliverable&#x02019; messages. Due to the potential that emails were rejected owing to being part of a mass mailing, individual emails were sent to these addresses, and seven participants were reached. This meant that of the 480 potential participants, 462 (96.3%) emails were delivered. By the beginning of October 2018, 235 participants had responded. A reminder email was sent to the remaining 228 people who had provided an email address but who had not yet completed the questionnaire. On 14 October, 327 (70.8%) responses had been received. The survey was closed at this time, having been made available for a month for phase two (P2).</p></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0150"><label>2.5</label><title>Sample Size</title><p>To determine the sample size needed to facilitate any relationship between the variables being investigated, a power analysis was performed, using G*Power 3.1.9.2 (Faul et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The current study aimed to use the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) to measure wellbeing. Therefore, previous studies utilising the GHQ were used to determine an estimated effect size.

<sup>2</sup> = 0.03), and indicated that a sample size of 607 was required. The original online survey received 863 responses from UK&#x02010;based SLTs, and Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jlcd70046-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the flowchart for the inclusion process of participants at P1.

It was piloted in January 2018 and issues that were identified (e.g., lack of clarity for some questions, too long taken to complete the questionnaire) were addressed.</p><p>The questionnaire at P1 included mostly closed&#x02010;ended questions and consisted of five sections:
<list list-type="roman-upper" id="jlcd70046-list-0005"><list-item><p>participant demographics,</p></list-item><list-item><p>working profiles, for example, full time/part time, tenure in current job,</p></list-item><list-item><p>job characteristics and psychosocial work environments, that is, caseload size, amount of control over service delivery, professional support received,</p></list-item><list-item><p>dispositional traits, for example, self&#x02010;esteem, optimism (these results, and the mediating effect that they had on the relationship between work and wellbeing, will be reported elsewhere),</p></list-item><list-item><p>wellbeing, for example, job satisfaction, anxiety, depression.</p></list-item></list>

The SLPSI has four subscales: &#x02018;Time and Workload Management&#x02019; (TWM), &#x02018;Bureaucratic Restrictions&#x02019; (BR), &#x02018;Instructional Limitations&#x02019; (IL) and &#x02018;Lack of Professional Support&#x02019; (LPS).

GHQ&#x02010;28 scores, measuring general psychosocial wellbeing, are calculated using a binary method (with the two least symptomatic answers scoring 0 and the two most symptomatic answers scoring 1). The GHQ&#x02010;28 classifies any total score meeting the threshold value of 4 as achieving &#x02018;caseness&#x02019; (Jackson <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). This &#x02018;caseness&#x02019; is an indication of psychological distress. The binary scores can be further classified into three bands (Nolan and Ryan <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>): no stress, mild stress (likely to resolve with intervention) and severe stress (unlikely to resolve without intervention).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Reliability of the outcome scales was assessed for this study and is reported in the Results section.</p><p>At P2, only the GJSS and GHQ&#x02010;28 were retained, and two questions were added:

Data was collected in 2018, before the onset of COVID&#x02010;19, and therefore describes the &#x02018;typical&#x02019; working life of SLTs, and their wellbeing associated with this work; without the confounding experiences of practicing during a pandemic. The study compared data collected from SLTs across the UK at two time points; Phase One (April to July 2018) and Phase Two (September to October 2018).</p><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0310"><label>4.1</label><title>Levels of General Wellbeing and Consistency Over Time</title><p>The majority of SLTs in the sample achieved &#x02018;caseness&#x02019; on the GHQ&#x02010;28, meaning that should they present at their GP; their symptoms (e.g., levels of anxiety) would attract further attention (Jackson <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In addition, a significant number were classified as having severe distress, that is, symptoms that were unlikely to resolve without intervention. Scores were stable over a 3&#x02010;month period, indicating that responses were unlikely to be the result of transient mood.</p><p>The GHQ&#x02010;28 has not been used with SLTs before, and results can therefore not be compared to other SLTs. It has, however, been employed in numerous studies investigating general wellbeing in other occupational groups and general populations. The current cohort's scores were worse than those that have previously been achieved by health workers in the UK (Wall et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), but better than those achieved by South African nurses (Khamisa et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Considering Karasek's (<xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>) theory regarding the relationship between employment conditions and wellbeing, a cautious interpretation of these differences may be that work environments differ in these assorted professions, or in these varied locations, resulting in dissimilar levels of general wellbeing.</p></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0320"><label>4.2</label><title>Levels of Job Satisfaction and Consistency Over Time</title><p>Research in the USA has shown some SLTs to have high job satisfaction (Hutchins et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The current UK&#x02010;based study found that the majority of the survey participants had average/high job satisfaction, providing some corroboration of existing information. However, a significant minority of participants surveyed reported low or very low job satisfaction.</p><p>The longitudinal findings of the survey revealed a small, but significant increase in job satisfaction over 3 months.</p><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0330"><label>4.2.1</label><title>The Effect of Personal Changes</title><p>Making positive personal changes between the two time points did not improve job satisfaction. This finding is consistent with that of Fleming (<xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>), who questioned the efficacy of common wellbeing interventions (e.g., wellbeing apps, mindfulness programmes and relaxation training), reporting no reliable difference in mental wellbeing between workers who had received intervention and those who had not. It is, however, in contrast with previous research that does demonstrate that personal wellbeing strategies improve health in the workplace&#x000a0;(Puerto Valencia et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). This difference could be because the current study required participants to report whether they had made any &#x02018;positive personal changes&#x02019; between the two questionnaires but did not control for what those changes were, how they were implemented, or whether there were confounding influences, therefore making comparison problematic.</p></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0340"><label>4.2.2</label><title>The Effect of Changing Jobs</title><p>Although the subgroup of SLTs who left their jobs was small, they had significantly lower job satisfaction at the time of the first survey than those who did not leave. Interpreted cautiously, this could indicate that those who are unhappiest choose to resign from their roles. Changing jobs resulted in an improvement in job satisfaction. Examining whether this improvement is maintained or whether it was a temporary spike in satisfaction was not within the scope of this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0350"><label>4.3</label><title>The Relationship Between Job Types and Wellbeing</title><p>The JDCS model (Johnson and Hall <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Karasek <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>) enabled exploration of the combined effect of the psychosocial elements of demand, control and support within the work environment on the wellbeing of SLTs. The model was applied to the data collected from the survey, and job types were identified. Of this sample, almost one fifth were in IsoStrain jobs. Consistent with several research studies (e.g., Nieuwenhuijsen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) participants who experienced high demand, low control and low support were more likely to experience case&#x02010;level psychological distress and low job satisfaction. Conversely, those SLTs in Active Collective/Low&#x02010;strain Collective jobs had the best general wellbeing and the highest job satisfaction. This study therefore provides novel information about SLT jobs and how these are associated with wellbeing, as well as further corroboration for previous findings linking jobs with high demands and low control to negative psychological wellbeing (van Doorn et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and low levels of job satisfaction (H&#x000e4;usser et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0360"><label>4.4</label><title>Clinical Implications</title><p>Healthy SLTs are more likely to stay in their jobs (Loan&#x02010;Clarke et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and to have the personal resources to support their service users effectively. The first step in supporting SLT wellbeing is to ensure that there is a clear understanding of the psychosocial composition of their jobs. The focus of this study has been broad, without the scope to assess individual workplaces. Leka et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) argue that psychosocial risks are embedded within work organisation, although a false distinction between the two is sometimes made. This study has revealed that a combination of potential workplace features, including demands, control (autonomy) and support, are associated with SLT job satisfaction, suggesting employers consider the overall psychosocial design of SLT jobs, instead of viewing occupational factors individually. The JDCS model has proved a suitable framework for describing SLT jobs, and it could be used in the future to gain detailed knowledge about different elements that constitute particular SLT jobs. A useful resource for employers in the UK is the Health and Safety Executive Management Standards Indicator Tool and workbook, a step&#x02010;by&#x02010;step risk assessment and intervention approach (Health and Safety Executive Standards, <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">n.d</xref>.). Risk is likely to be different in different settings, and depending on the employer. It is essential that the voices of SLTs who are primarily clinical are heard and used to inform this appraisal; collaboration between managers and clinicians is necessary for success in this endeavour. Working parties could facilitate this appraisal, which should include details of the demands (physical, emotional, psychological and in terms of workload), control (e.g., levels of autonomy regarding service delivery) and support (supervision and informal support) that characterise a job. This work will potentially be difficult, given the prevailing culture within healthcare, which places responsibility for wellbeing on the individual by encouraging self&#x02010;reliance and coping (Harvey et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). However, clear knowledge of the psychosocial elements of SLT jobs is the starting point for change, and once this knowledge is in place, areas that require development can be addressed.</p></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0370"><label>4.5</label><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>This research was the first of its kind to directly investigate the occupational as well as general wellbeing of SLTs practising clinically in the UK, to use a theoretical model to frame the research and to focus on wellbeing per se. With 632 participants at P1 and 295 paired responses at the follow&#x02010;up, this is also the largest study of its kind in the UK. Participants were recruited from across the country and included paediatric SLTs and those working with adults, as well as employed and self&#x02010;employed SLTs, possibly supporting the generalisation of findings. A further strength of this study was its longitudinal element, as repeated measurement can go some way to ameliorating the effects of common method variance, including mood and context (Siegrist et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of the study was that self&#x02010;report was used, which could have resulted in participant response bias, with either the happiest or the most stressed SLTs not being represented. Although unequivocally identifying whether the survey results were affected by response bias is not straightforward, the questionnaire was carefully designed and piloted in an attempt to minimise this. A further limitation was that the survey instrument used was published online. Although self&#x02010;administered survey modes may reduce the impact of social desirability, the online survey could have resulted in selection bias, resulting in an unrepresentative sample. At P2, the number of participants who had changed jobs was small, meaning that cautious interpretation of findings is prudent. Finally, the questionnaire at P2 did not include questions about job factors, meaning that a cause&#x02010;effect relationship between work and wellbeing could not be established.</p></sec></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0380"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results of this study indicate that, before the onset of COVID&#x02010;19, just over half of SLTs working clinically in the UK were at risk of being psychologically vulnerable to anxiety, depression, experiencing somatic symptoms of stress and social dysfunction. This is a worrying finding, suggesting that there were psychological health issues in the workforce before the COVID&#x02010;19 pandemic commenced, and having possible implications for SLT career longevity.</p><p>More recent studies have focussed on the effects of working during COVID&#x02010;19 on the wellbeing and job satisfaction of health workers (e.g., Gilleen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) and SLTs more specifically (Farquharson et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Although long&#x02010;term effects of the psychological impact of working as an SLT during the pandemic are currently unknown, there is a danger of presuming that SLTs enjoyed high levels of mental health and job satisfaction pre&#x02010;COVID&#x02010;19. It is arguably important to establish wellbeing indicator benchmarks associated with typical jobs for comparison purposes and to guard against return to a &#x02018;normal&#x02019; that might not be supportive of worker wellbeing. Currently, postpandemic research continues to report burnout and extreme emotional exhaustion in SLTs (Coleman et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>), suggesting poor wellbeing continues to be an area requiring attention.</p><p>Although some stakeholders consider psychosocial risks difficult to address in a preventative fashion, focussing on opportunities and resources is necessary to mitigate risk (Leka et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="jlcd70046-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Findings of this study suggest that SLTs with the lowest job satisfaction leave their jobs. There is therefore a need for holistic appraisal of SLT job design to ensure that workplaces provide the environments necessary for promoting manageable demands, effective support and genuine autonomy. This appraisal must include input from front&#x02010;line practitioners and can determine whether and how the design of jobs requires addressing. Finally, this research is a first step in the attempt to understand and support the wellbeing of SLTs associated with their typical jobs. It is a snapshot of their lives and as such, given the findings, it is the ethical responsibility of researchers to continue to study this neglected area to assist in attempts to ensure that psychosocial risks are managed, and hazards are remedied.</p></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0390"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from The Business, Law and Social Sciences Faculty Research Committee at Birmingham City University.</p></sec><sec id="jlcd70046-sec-0400"><title>Consent</title><p>All respondents provided written and informed consent to participate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="jlcd70046-sec-0410"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group id="jlcd70046-ntgp-0001"><title>Endnotes</title><fn id="jlcd70046-note-0001"><label>1</label><p>The Association of Speech and Language Therapists in Independent Practice (ASLTIP) is an organisation to which many independent SLTs in the UK voluntarily belong.</p></fn><fn id="jlcd70046-note-0002"><label>2</label><p>Independent Practitioners in Speech and Language Therapy (IPSLT) is an online support group for any SLTs in independent practice in the UK.</p></fn></fn-group><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="jlcd70046-sec-0430"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
