Vaccination during pregnancy provides protection to pregnant woman and her infant through antibodies that can pass through the placenta to stimulate the infant&#x02019;s immune system, thereby providing an effective defense against potential complications prior to the infant&#x02019;s vaccination taking effect [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This preventive strategy offers a promising path to saving lives and promoting healthy beginnings for infants and mothers worldwide [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p id="P7">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends several vaccines for pregnancy, including vaccines against maternal and neonatal tetanus, influenza, and infant pertussis [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The tetanus vaccine has been routinely used in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), and its safety profile has been demonstrated despite limited monitoring systems for antenatal vaccination [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the safety of other vaccines used, for example, in disease outbreaks in LMICs, has not been extensively studied. The anticipated deployment of new vaccines targeting diseases such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Group B streptococcus (GBS) is imminent to reduce newborn morbidity and mortality. Some new vaccines employ novel technologies underpinning the need for strengthened safety surveillance systems [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Currently, LMIC safety surveillance systems are predominantly passive, thus presenting challenges in monitoring and analyzing adverse events following maternal immunization (AEFMI) [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Passive systems suffer from several limitations, including underreporting, varying data quality, lack of a denominator data to obtain incidence rates, and lack of background information on medical events [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Systems that are integrated into current safety reporting practices and can systematically track and monitor the outcomes of pregnant women and their infants over time are necessary for both new vaccines and those used in pandemic or disease outbreaks [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Electronic medical records, custom software platforms (e.g. District Health Information System) and research networks (Health and Demographic Surveillance systems) are available in resource-limited settings with potential to collect data and tracking the progress of pregnant women and their infants during the perinatal and postnatal periods. However, there has been limited utility of these systems for post-marketing surveillance of vaccines administered to pregnant women, underscoring the need to adopt them for the surveillance of vaccine safety in pregnancy [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Uganda recommends that pregnant women receive two doses of the tetanus-diphtheria vaccine, with a maximum of five doses to women in childbearing years (ages 15-45)[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ugandan pregnant women were also offered COVID-19 vaccines despite a lack of safety data in pregnancy. In addition, vaccines not generally recommended during pregnancy have been occasionally administered during disease outbreaks and mass vaccination campaigns [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Uganda operates a pharmacovigilance system [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], however structures, functions and people constraints mean that the current system requires strengthening to conduct safety surveillance from maternal immunization. As more maternal vaccines are offered in pregnancy in Uganda, building a robust Pharmacovigilance (PV) system that can capture events related to maternal immunization is essential. Such a system must be equipped to monitor known AEFMIs and potential new and rare events.</p><p id="P9">This study aimed to map stakeholders, identify gaps in existing pharmacovigilance systems, and assess the potential for utilizing electronic medical records and registries to monitor AEFMI in Uganda.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Study Design</title><p id="P10">This study employed a qualitative approach, utilizing key informant interviews and focus group discussions.

The framework domains include the people (adverse event reporters and evaluators), functions (data collection, data evaluation, and data utilization for decision-making) and structures (Ministry of Health, regulatory agency/pharmacovigilance center, industry, and advisory committees, among others). The interview questions explored two key areas: general PV structures, processes, and those tailored explicitly for maternal vaccines. Prior to implementation, the interview guide underwent testing and refinement through role-play exercises with the research assistants responsible for data collection. The study adopted a relationship-based approach to map stakeholders, guided by the Pharmacovigilance framework.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Study Sites, study population and sample distribution</title><p id="P11">In the context of the pharmacovigilance (PV) framework, various stakeholders were actively engaged in the study, including policymakers at the national level (Ministry of Health (MOH), WHO country office), the drug regulatory agency/pharmacovigilance center (National Drug Authority (NDA)), and public health programs (immunization program, Maternal and Child Health), as well as implementers (health facilities providing antenatal care (ANC)). A purposive and representative sampling technique was employed to select participants from these identified stakeholders, ensuring the collection of insights pertinent to our research objectives.</p><p id="P12">Uganda&#x02019;s public health care system operates on a decentralized model, with lower-level facilities including Health Centre IIs, Health Centre IIIs and Health Centre IVs being managed by the districts while the Ministry of Health oversees the hospitals [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We employed purposive sampling to select five health facilities across three geographical regions: Eastern, Western, and Central Uganda.

The first step was transcribing the data, followed by open coding using inductive and deductive coding to identify emerging themes and subthemes. The data analysis involved a combination of inductive and deductive coding applications using a pre-developed codebook with a priori codes. Codes were changed, and emerging codes were added through the inter-coder reliability process, only if deemed necessary by the whole coding team. The codebook was finalized and applied to all the transcripts, before final analysis, using a consistent set of codes and a uniform understanding of how to apply them. A coder reliability check was performed on 10% of coded transcripts selected randomly throughout the coding process. Later, we uploaded the transcripts to ATLAS.ti version 9 to generate a query report. [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

However, at the time of this study there was no dedicated program for pharmacovigilance of maternal immunization. The World Health Organization (WHO) provided international policy guidance for vaccination, while the coordination of pharmacovigilance activities of medicines and vaccines in collaboration with other stakeholders was the mandate of the National Drug Authority (NDA). The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Uganda National Expanded Programme on Immunization [UNEPI] are instrumental in shaping policies and developing guidelines for the use of vaccines and monitoring for quality and safety along the distribution chain. The National Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) Committee, established by the MOH, was responsible for providing technical guidance on the classification and causal assessment of serious AEFIs. The committee&#x02019;s role included evaluating the relationship between vaccines and reported adverse events and providing specific recommendations to enhance vaccine safety protocols.</p><disp-quote id="Q1"><p id="P22"><italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;I would not say we have a special arm dedicated to pregnant women, but generally, we work with UNEPI and WHO to monitor all vaccines used.

There was no specific official approach for monitoring the use of vaccines in pregnant women except through the general PV system used for all health products. AEFI, if it occurred in pregnant women, was reported using tools provided by the NDA. Nevertheless, there were some efforts to implement active surveillance for other products, like the Dolutegravir-based regimen used to manage HIV and COVID-19 vaccines in sentinel sites</p><disp-quote id="Q2"><p id="P26"><italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;We don&#x02019;t have a special system for pregnant women.

This system was reported to be in use across more than 360 public and private health facilities.[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

This is the first study in Uganda to provide an in-depth analysis of how maternal vaccines are currently monitored within the broader context of surveillance structures used for all health products.</p><p id="P41">One significant finding was the absence of a targeted strategy focusing on vaccines used in maternal immunization. The reporting system was generic, without recognizing the uniqueness that PV for vaccines used in pregnancy may present. Relying on passive surveillance as the primary method of data collection to monitor vaccines used in maternal immunization poses challenges, such as underreporting of adverse events and health outcomes in pregnant women.</p><p id="P42">While tetanus vaccines have been routinely used for a considerably long time, the introduction of other vaccines administered to pregnant women has not considered the need for an appropriate framework for monitoring potential adverse events in this population. Additionally, the reporting system is fragmented with many parallel PV systems that are not integrated into a central information hub, thus limiting the ability to detect and respond to safety signals effectively.</p><p id="P43">However, a &#x0201c;silver lining&#x0201d; emerged; stakeholders across the healthcare system were working to ensure vaccine safety and appropriate use. Harnessing collaboration among all stakeholders through discussions centered on an integrated approach to maternal vaccine safety monitoring is crucial. This collective effort aligns with previous studies conducted in LMICs [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which have emphasized the importance of leveraging such collaborations to strengthen and build more robust PV systems for maternal vaccines.</p><p id="P44">The study revealed that a minimal proportion, less than 1%, of AEFI reports from the NDA pertained to pregnant women receiving routine maternal vaccines, such as tetanus, despite the administration of other vaccines during mass vaccinations. This observation may be attributed to the perception that the side effects experienced are mild and within the range of normalcy, thus not warranting formal reporting. In discussions with healthcare workers, we found that during educational sessions, women are advised that the side effects they may experience are mild and expected, potentially contributing to underreporting. A systematic review indicated that a lack of knowledge regarding adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting&#x02014;where healthcare professionals perceive that only serious ADRs necessitate reporting&#x02014;significantly contributes to the underreporting of ADRs[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, it suggests a potential inadequacy in the current system&#x02019;s capacity to discern adverse events in pregnant women beyond the readily identifiable reactogenic effects of vaccines.</p><p id="P45">Healthcare workers encountered several challenges when it came to reporting, such as [i] lack of feedback, which discouraged further participation; [ii] heavy workload and competing demands, leaving little time for AEFI reporting; [iii] inadequate knowledge to identify and report AEFIs; [iv] incomplete medical information, which made causality assessments difficult; and [v] logistical challenges, such as limited internet access, which hinder both reporting and follow-up with clients. Similar challenges have been reported in studies conducted globally, including in low- and middle-income countries [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p id="P46">While Inman&#x02019;s &#x0201c;seven deadly sins&#x0201d; described underreporting decades ago [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], our study identified additional barriers. The lack of feedback and incentives diminish motivation, while logistical hurdles like poor internet access create practical barriers. Difficulties accessing the internet could be overcome by providing healthcare facilities with free internet hotspots, thus improving internet access and facilitating reporting of these events. Finally, monetary incentives to report were a frequently cited topic; however, previous research shows that this leads to an unsustainable dependence on payment [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p id="P47">Our findings indicate that healthcare professional education is essential. Healthcare professionals need to know the importance of safety reporting and recognize that it is part of their professional duties, not an optional task for which remuneration should be expected. Furthermore, failing to identify an adverse reaction can be a form of misdiagnosis, and reporting any suspected adverse outcome to a vaccine or medicine is integral to good healthcare practice [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><sec id="S22"><title>Facing the future</title><p id="P48">As proposed in Figure, <xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Digital Content 7</xref>, a multi-pronged approach is necessary to strengthen the pharmacovigilance of maternal vaccines in Uganda. Establishing a dedicated policy and agenda for monitoring AEFMI is needed to foster collaboration among multiple stakeholders. Active Pharmacovigilance offers a promising complement for passive surveillance, especially for monitoring new vaccines, targeted campaigns, and specific severe reactions/adverse events of special interest [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p id="P49">While the efficiency of active monitoring is well established, resource constraints within the Ugandan context must be carefully considered. A practical solution is building upon existing, less resource-intensive efforts like the ODK-based birth defect surveillance system while customizing to link vaccination and infant data in sentinel sites. This system could be readily adapted through brief training for healthcare professionals attending deliveries, [midwives, and OB-GYNs on the safety monitoring system, its importance, and reporting procedures [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The existing DHIS platform and the health and demographic surveillance available in the country could be explored for active surveillance of AESI related to maternal vaccination [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Provision linking infant data with maternal records is essential to monitor maternal and infant outcomes. This is important because pregnancy vaccination impacts maternal safety and infant health; hence, postnatal follow-up needs [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, tools that link the antenatal and postnatal care records need to be explored. Additionally, it is essential to reiterate the basic principle of pharmacovigilance: the possibility of an adverse outcome related to a vaccine or medicine must be systematically included in the differential diagnoses at any healthcare facility [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p id="P50">Tackling the fragmentation of existing systems is also crucial. Parallel platforms hinder information flow and can overburden reporters, leading to &#x0201c;reporting fatigue.&#x0201d; A practical solution would be to implement a unified system for collecting minimal data on all critical pregnancy outcomes to provide insights into potential safety concerns. In addition, data on pregnancy outcomes collected from research institutions ought to be shared with the regulators and MoH to enable an end&#x02013;to&#x02013;end system that will detect and evaluate safety issues.</p><p id="P51">The potential of EMR to capture AEFIs in real-time, including those related to maternal vaccines, has been highlighted in previous studies [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The EMR systems already implemented by the MoH and research institutions for patient management offer a valuable opportunity to achieve this. The existing UgandaEMR can be enhanced with features that support tracking pregnant women and linking their data to their offspring. This would align with existing workflows within the health facilities. However, two key considerations must be addressed: first, ensuring seamless data access and linkage among all stakeholders involved in maternal vaccine safety monitoring, and secondly, thorough training of healthcare providers on accurate data entry. Even the best EMR system will fail without correct and complete data.</p><p id="P52">Training health workers at the point-of-care facility to identify, assess, and report both relevant adverse events in pregnant mothers and unexpected effects that may signal safety issues, is critical. Training healthcare professionals to carefully consider current and past treatments in diagnoses will improve the identification of safety issues, including among pregnant women and newborns.</p><p id="P53">Additionally, consistency in using standardized medical terms is important for clear communication, data analysis and equipping the national vaccine safety committee with the expertise to assess potential causal links between events and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Similar studies in India [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and Ghana [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] confirm that lack of knowledge and misdiagnosis are the critical barriers to reporting adverse events. Therefore, the PV program should leverage training and standardized case definitions for AEFMI [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p id="P54">In cases where vaccines are not registered or indicated for use in pregnant women, there is need for clear policies and communication including safety monitoring. Other studies have emphasized the importance of clear communication about the rationale and recommended course of action between regulatory bodies, public health authorities, and healthcare providers should AEFMI occur and when products are used in emergencies [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p id="P55">The key strength of this study was the ability to gather insights from informants and group discussions that included both policymakers and implementers. This enabled us to explore real-world experiences and activities that influence the practical implementation of the maternal vaccine safety surveillance. However, the study has some limitations as some stakeholders and geographical regions could have been excluded due to the small sample size, thus limiting the breadth of perspectives. The sampling approach used in the study might limit the generalizability of our findings. These limitations should be considered when interpreting the study results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Conclusion and Recommendations</title><p id="P56">Our study identified gaps in Uganda&#x02019;s pharmacovigilance system for maternal vaccines that can be addressed. We recommend a multi-pronged approach, including developing coherent policies, strengthening active surveillance through existing systems, and harnessing healthcare provider knowledge and advisory committee capacity in causality assessment. Our findings provide a basis for prioritizing interventions to build an integrated national surveillance system that can effectively monitor both existing and future maternal vaccines in Uganda.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>SDC1</label><media xlink:href="EMS202778-supplement-SDC1.docx" id="d67e707" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD2" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>SDC2</label><media xlink:href="EMS202778-supplement-SDC2.docx" id="d67e710" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD3" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>SDC3</label><media xlink:href="EMS202778-supplement-SDC3.docx" id="d67e713" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD4" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>SDC4</label><media xlink:href="EMS202778-supplement-SDC4.docx" id="d67e716" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD5" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>SDC5</label><media xlink:href="EMS202778-supplement-SDC5.docx" id="d67e719" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD6" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>SDC6</label><media xlink:href="EMS202778-supplement-SDC6.docx" id="d67e722" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD7" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>SDC7</label><media xlink:href="EMS202778-supplement-SDC7.pptx" id="d67e725" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p><italic toggle="yes">The authors thank all individuals and organizations for support rendered during the implementation of the study.
