The limited arsenal of effective antifungal agents underscores the urgent need for novel strategies. Here, we systematically evaluate the role of histone H3 post-translational modifications in <italic>C. auris</italic> drug resistance, focusing on acetylation mediated by Gcn5 and Rtt109, and methylation mediated by Set1, Set2, and Dot1. Mutants deficient in these enzymes exhibit varying degrees of antifungal drug sensitivity. Notably, we discover that <italic>GCN5</italic> depletion and the subsequent loss of histone H3 acetylation downregulates key genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis and drug efflux, resulting in increased susceptibility to azoles and polyenes. Additionally, Gcn5 regulates cell wall integrity and echinocandin resistance through the calcineurin signaling pathway and transcription factor Cas5. In infection models using <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> and immunocompromised mice, <italic>GCN5</italic> deletion significantly reduces the virulence of <italic>C. auris</italic>. Furthermore, the Gcn5 inhibitor CPTH<sub>2</sub> synergizes with caspofungin in vitro and in vivo without notable toxicity.

These infections have a profound impact on global health, affecting over 1&#x02009;billion individuals worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Invasive fungal infections, particularly those caused by common pathogens such as <italic>Candida spp</italic>., <italic>Cryptococcus spp</italic>., <italic>Aspergillus spp</italic>., and <italic>Pneumocystis spp</italic>., are recognized as hidden killers, with mortality rates often exceeding 50%. These infections lead to ~2.5&#x02009;million deaths annually, posing a substantial threat to global public health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify targets for safe and effective countermeasures, such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics, that may help reduce in-hospital mortality rates associated with invasive fungal infections.</p><p id="Par4">The emerging &#x0201c;super fungus&#x0201d; <italic>Candida auris</italic> was first isolated in 2009 from an ear canal of a Japanese patient and has since spread across &#x0003e;40 countries on six continents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. A direct consequence of invasive <italic>C. auris</italic> infection is the risk of cross-infection among patients and hospital outbreaks due to its remarkable ability to adhere to both biological and non-biological surfaces, its long-term survival under extreme conditions, and its resistance to conventional disinfection methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. For instance, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased number of <italic>C. auris</italic> infections has been reported in COVID-19 intensive care units (ICUs) in countries such as the United States, Germany, India, and Mexico<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Although statistics may vary across reports, mortality rates attributable to invasive <italic>C. auris</italic> infections can reach as high as 70%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, posing a significant threat and a formidable challenge to the medical field. Notably, <italic>C. auris</italic>, along with <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, and <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, has been classified in the critical priority group of fungal pathogens in the World Health Organization&#x02019;s (WHO) recently released fungal priority pathogen list<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The recent emergence of fungi with inherent or acquired resistance to one or more antifungal drugs has become a serious concern. Currently, only three major classes of antifungal drugs, including azoles (e.g., fluconazole), polyenes (e.g., amphotericin B), and echinocandins (e.g., caspofungin), are available in clinical practice for the treatment of invasive fungal infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Recent studies on the multidrug resistance of <italic>C. auris</italic> have revealed that over 90% of clinical isolates are resistant to fluconazole, 30-41% are resistant to two classes of antifungal drugs, and approximately 4% are resistant to three or more<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, <italic>C. auris</italic> can rapidly acquire resistance under the selective pressure of antifungal treatments or other specific conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. For instance, isolates from patients receiving caspofungin treatment have been shown to develop resistance to echinocandins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, the ongoing rise in multidrug-resistant fungi such as <italic>C. auris</italic> demands continued vigilance and further efforts to develop novel antifungal agents and treatment strategies.</p><p id="Par6">Epigenetics refers to stable and heritable changes in gene expression that are not due to alterations in the DNA sequence but are regulated through post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones, DNA methylation, and RNA-based mechanisms. Histone PTMs play a pivotal role in modulating chromatin structure, thereby influencing DNA accessibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Proteins involved in this process are categorized as &#x0201c;writers,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;readers,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;erasers,&#x0201d; functioning to interpret and regulate the histone code through various PTM combinations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Recent studies have demonstrated the critical role of histone H3 PTMs, such as methylation and acetylation, in driving both drug resistance and pathogenicity in human fungal pathogens. For instance, the histone H3 acetyltransferase complex SAGA is essential for the pathogenicity of fungi such as <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>Nakaseomyces glabratus</italic> (formerly known as <italic>Candida glabrata)</italic>, <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Disrupting the gene encoding the acetyltransferase catalytic subunit Gcn5 results in significant defects in the pathogenicity and drug resistance of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>N. glabratus</italic>, as well as reduced pathogenicity in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and multiple virulence-related phenotypes in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. Furthermore, the histone H3K56 acetyltransferase Rtt109 has been linked to the pathogenicity of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and its resistance to echinocandins and azole drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The COMPASS complex, which includes the histone H3K4 methyltransferase catalytic subunit Set1, promotes resistance in <italic>N. glabratus</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to azole drugs and brefeldin A by regulating genes involved in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway and drug efflux pumps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Additionally, Set1 significantly influences <italic>C. albicans</italic> virulence in mouse models of invasive infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The inhibitor MGCD290 is a new type of antifungal drug targeting the histone deacetylase Hos2 and currently in Phase II clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, highlighting the therapeutic potential of histone H3 PTMs as antifungal targets. However, the role of histone H3 PTMs in the pathogenicity and drug resistance of <italic>C. auris</italic> remains unexplored.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of histone H3 PTM writers, including the acetyltransferases Gcn5 and Rtt109 and the methyltransferases Set1, Set2, and Dot1, on the pathogenicity and drug resistance of <italic>C. auris</italic>. Our research demonstrates that the disruption of genes encoding these histone H3 PTM writers leads to varied susceptibilities to a range of antifungal agents. Specifically, the histone H3 acetyltransferase Gcn5 is essential for the resistance of <italic>C. auris</italic> to azole, echinocandin, and polyene antifungal drugs, as well as for its virulence. Additionally, we found that the Gcn5-specific inhibitor CPTH<sub>2</sub>, when combined with the echinocandin antifungal agent caspofungin, exhibits a synergistic effect against <italic>C. auris</italic> in both in vitro and in vivo models. These findings suggest that targeting epigenetic regulators such as Gcn5 could represent a promising strategy to address the challenges of drug resistance posed by this emerging superbug.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Histone H3 PTMs in <italic>C. auris</italic> exhibit dynamic responses to antifungal exposure</title><p id="Par8">In our initial foray for the relationship between histone H3 PTMs and antifungal resistance in <italic>C. auris</italic>, we treated the fluconazole-resistant strain CBS12767 (Clade I) with various antifungals, including the echinocandin caspofungin (CAS), the azole fluconazole (FLC), and the pyrimidine analog 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC). We then examined the global patterns of histone modification changes in acetylation and methylation. Interestingly, compared to the control (DMSO treatment), CAS treatment significantly increased acetylation at specific lysine residues on histone H3, particularly at K9, K14, K18, K27, K36, and K56 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Concurrently, CAS exposure also led to an elevated level of trimethylation at histone H3K36 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), highlighting a potential epigenetic mechanism underlying the emergence of antifungal drug resistance in <italic>C. auris</italic>. Conversely, treatments with FLC or 5-FC did not induce noticeable changes in these histone modifications (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). Further multiple sequence alignment analysis, comparing the genome sequences of model organisms <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>, allowed us to identify specific gene homologs in <italic>C. auris</italic> responsible for these histone modifications.

Conversely, the <italic>GCN5 AB</italic> strain exhibited no discernible differences in acetylation patterns compared to the wild-type CBS12767 strain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), affirming the preserved function of <italic>GCN5</italic> in <italic>C. auris</italic>. Notably, while the <italic>RTT109</italic> knockout resulted in a marked decrease in H3K56 acetylation, this modification was not entirely lost, indicating a divergence from observations in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). In contrast, H3K56 acetylation was almost completely absent in <italic>gcn5</italic>&#x00394;. This suggests a collaborative role between Gcn5 and Rtt109 in mediating H3K56 acetylation, with a more pronounced contribution from Gcn5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>). Furthermore, our study revealed that deletions of <italic>SET1</italic> or <italic>SET2</italic> led to the complete loss of mono-, di-, and trimethylation at H3K4 or H3K36, respectively, and knocking out <italic>DOT1</italic> resulted in the absence of H3K79 trimethylation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g&#x02013;i</xref>). In summary, our data indicate that the homologous genes encoding histone-modifying enzymes, such as Gcn5, Rtt109, Set1, Set2, and Dot1, are highly conserved in <italic>C. auris</italic>, and their products retain the ability to modify chromatin structure. This reinforces the concept of a conserved epigenetic regulatory framework within this pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Antifungal resistance in <italic>C. auris</italic> is linked to the activity of Lysine acetyltransferase Gcn5</title><p id="Par11">To evaluate the impact of histone H3 PTMs on antifungal resistance in <italic>C. auris</italic>, we performed a comparative analysis of drug sensitivity among wild-type and mutant strains using a range of clinically relevant antifungals. Drug susceptibility tests using spot assays revealed that the isogenic mutant strains lacking <italic>GCN5</italic>, specifically, <italic>gcn5</italic>&#x00394; from the <italic>C. auris</italic> CBS12767 background and <italic>gcn5</italic>&#x00394;-2 from the yCB799 background, exhibited significantly increased sensitivity to various antifungal classes, including echinocandins, azoles, and polyenes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>).

This discrepancy may be attributed to disruptions in the <italic>LEU2</italic> gene resulting from the integration of the <italic>GCN5</italic> ORF (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), as we observed that the <italic>LEU2</italic> knockout strain (<italic>leu2</italic>&#x00394;) in the CBS12767 background showed increased sensitivity to AmB while retaining wild-type resistance to other antifungals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1c</xref>). Crucially, we found that when cells were treated with CPTH<sub>2</sub> at a concentration of 0.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;M, a concentration that effectively inhibits Gcn5-mediated histone H3 acetylation, both wild-type and <italic>leu2</italic>&#x00394; mutant strains displayed similar drug sensitivity profiles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1d, e</xref>). This outcome strongly suggests that the lack of <italic>LEU2</italic> has no impact on the drug response mediated by Gcn5.

Interestingly, we observed a differential response to micafungin (MCF) among the knockout strains: <italic>gcn5</italic>&#x00394; displayed heightened sensitivity, while <italic>gcn5</italic>&#x00394;-2 demonstrated increased resistance, likely due to variations in the gene expression and/or genetic backgrounds of the two parental strains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). Deletion of <italic>GCN5</italic> in both wild-type strains did not significantly affect their resistance to 5-FC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). Additionally, mutants lacking the <italic>SET1</italic> and <italic>RTT109</italic> genes in the CBS12767 background exhibited enhanced vulnerability to echinocandins, azoles, and AmB, although the effects were less pronounced compared to the <italic>gcn5</italic>&#x00394; strain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>). The deletion of <italic>DOT1</italic> resulted in increased sensitivity to AmB and a moderate elevation in susceptibility to echinocandins. In contrast, the azole susceptibilities of the deletion mutant remained comparable to those of the wild-type strain CBS12767 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>set2</italic>&#x00394; mutant showed increased resistance to azole antifungals, implicating Set2 as a negative regulator of azole resistance in <italic>C. auris</italic>, in line with observations in <italic>N. glabratus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>).

Interestingly, overexpression of <italic>CAS5</italic> and <italic>CNA1</italic>, but not <italic>CRZ1</italic>, partially restored resistance to CAS in the <italic>gcn5</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; mutant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Furthermore, to clarify the regulatory relationship between Gcn5 and Cna1, we examined whether <italic>CNA1</italic> deletion affects Gcn5-dependent histone H3 acetylation. We found that the <italic>cna1</italic>&#x00394; strain exhibited no significant changes in Gcn5-mediated H3 acetylation levels compared to the wild-type, regardless of caspofungin treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3d</xref>). These findings strongly suggest that the influence of the calcineurin pathway on Gcn5-mediated echinocandin resistance occurs independently of Crz1, potentially functioning through Cas5 instead, thereby highlighting a complex regulatory pathway distinct from previously characterized models.</p><p id="Par17">The observation that Gcn5 impacts the expression of genes such as <italic>CRZ1</italic> and <italic>CAS5</italic> led us to hypothesize that this histone acetyltransferase may play a critical role in modulating the calcium-calcineurin signaling pathway and cell wall integrity stress. As illustrated in (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), the <italic>C. auris</italic> mutant lacking <italic>GCN5</italic> exhibited increased susceptibility to elevated calcium ion levels, akin to the phenotypes observed with the knockout of <italic>CNA1</italic>, <italic>CRZ1</italic>, or <italic>CAS5</italic>. This highlights the connection of Gcn5 to the calcineurin signaling pathway. Compared to the Wild-type, the <italic>gcn5</italic>&#x00394; mutant displayed decreased expression levels of a range of genes (e.g., <italic>CHS2, PGA52, RBE1</italic>, and <italic>UTR2</italic>) integral to cell wall stability and regulated by Cas5 under CAS treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4a</xref>). An interesting observation emerged from our analysis: neither CBS12767 nor yCB799 treated with MCF showed any significant changes in the expression of Cas5-regulated genes, particularly <italic>CHS2, ALS1, PGA42</italic>, and <italic>RBE1</italic>, which were significantly upregulated under CAS treatment. This finding implies that MCF and CAS may elicit distinct stress response pathways in <italic>C. auris</italic> and importantly, the differential role of Gcn5 in modulating susceptibility to MCF is unlikely to be attributable to transcriptional disparities of these already characterized Gcn5-regulated genes between CBS12767 and yCB799 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4b-e</xref>). Genomic analysis revealed mutations (S639F and L906S) in the <italic>FKS1</italic> locus exclusively in strain yCB799, while strain CBS12767 remained wild-type at this locus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4f</xref>), suggesting that these mutations potentially contribute to the strain-specific differences in MCF sensitivity, a hypothesis that warrants further functional validation. Additionally, defects in cell wall stability following exposure to Calcofluor White (CFW) or Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) were observed in the <italic>gcn5</italic>&#x00394; mutant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). In particular, we observed marked disorganization in chitin distribution, particularly around the septum, in the cell wall of the <italic>gcn5</italic>&#x00394; mutant, in contrast to the orderly arrangement in the WT and <italic>GCN5 AB</italic> strains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). Consistently, phosphorylation of the Hog1, Mkc1, and Cek1 MAP kinases was significantly elevated in the <italic>gcn5</italic>&#x00394; mutant compared to the wild-type, suggesting that the absence of <italic>GCN5</italic> induces cell wall perturbations in <italic>C. auris</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>). These results suggest that this complex interaction not only highlights the critical role of Gcn5 in echinocandin resistance and cell wall stability but also reveals the sophisticated regulatory mechanisms fungi utilize to adapt to environmental stressors and antifungal pressures. To further validate the direct role of Gcn5 in regulating calcineurin signaling and <italic>FKS1</italic> expression through histone H3 acetylation, we performed ChIP-qPCR to examine H3K14Ac enrichment at their promoter regions following CAS induction. Time-course experiments revealed progressive H3K14 acetylation at the <italic>CAS5, CRZ1</italic>, and <italic>FKS1</italic> promoters, peaking ~1&#x02009;h post-treatment&#x02014;coinciding with the transcriptional activation of these stress-responsive genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4g&#x02013;i</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">In summary, our data emphasize the essential role of Gcn5 in maintaining the cell wall integrity of <italic>C. auris</italic>, particularly through its regulation of the calcineurin pathway and Cas5.

To test this hypothesis further, we conducted experiments using immunocompromised C57BL/6 mice infected with either the echinocandin-resistant strain yCB799 or a <italic>gcn5</italic>&#x00394;-2 mutant. Four hours post-infection, the mice were treated intraperitoneally with 5&#x02009;mg/kg of CAS or a solvent control every 12&#x02009;h, receiving either 4 or 8 doses.

Most research focused on developing novel antifungal agents emphasizes targeting the fungal cell wall or membrane, either directly or indirectly, to disrupt homeostasis, thus inhibiting fungal growth or mitigating drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This study aims to identify a specific protein that regulates the expression of genes involved in maintaining cell wall and membrane homeostasis in <italic>C. auris</italic> at the transcriptional level. Gene expression in both higher mammals and unicellular fungi is known to be regulated by epigenetics, with PTMs of histone H3 playing a pivotal role. Previous studies have demonstrated a close link between these modifications and drug resistance, as well as pathogenicity in human pathogenic fungi. For instance, the histone H3 acetyltransferase complex SAGA is critical for the pathogenicity and virulence of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>N. glabratus</italic>, <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. Disruption of the gene encoding the acetyltransferase catalytic subunit <italic>GCN5</italic> leads to significant defects in the pathogenicity and drug resistance of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>N. glabratus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, as well as reduced pathogenicity in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and various virulence-related phenotypes in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Similarly, the knockout of the gene encoding the core module subunit <italic>SPT20</italic> of the SAGA complex markedly diminishes the pathogenicity of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Given the technical challenges associated with manipulating <italic>C. auris</italic> genes, our study focused on the genes responsible for writing histone H3 PTMs to explore their effects on antifungal susceptibility and pathogenicity in <italic>C. auris</italic>, aiming to uncover potential therapeutic targets.</p><p id="Par27">Our study represents the first comprehensive examination of histone H3 PTMs in relation to drug resistance and pathogenicity in <italic>C. auris</italic>. We discovered that Gcn5 plays a crucial role in the resistance of <italic>C. auris</italic> to multiple antifungal agents, including azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes. The role of Gcn5 in azole resistance involves two key mechanisms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). First, it regulates the expression of genes involved in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, such as <italic>ERG11, ERG1, ERG3</italic>, and <italic>ERG25</italic>. Also, it controls <italic>UPC2</italic>, a transcription factor that influences these genes. Disruption of <italic>GCN5</italic> impairs ergosterol synthesis, compromising the integrity of the fungal cell membrane, which explains why the <italic>gcn5</italic>&#x00394; mutant exhibits heightened sensitivity to amphotericin B, a drug that targets ergosterol. Second, Gcn5 is critical for the activation of drug efflux pump genes, including <italic>CDR1, SNQ2</italic>, and <italic>MDR1</italic>, which expel azole drugs from the cells, thereby diminishing their efficacy.</p><p id="Par28">Moreover, our study reveals that Gcn5 affects echinocandin resistance in <italic>C. auris</italic> by influencing cell wall integrity and calcium homeostasis, mediated through the transcription factor Cas5 and the calcineurin pathway (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Given the challenges of performing multiple rounds of genetic manipulation in <italic>C. auris</italic>, we opted for an alternative approach by overexpressing <italic>CAS5</italic>, <italic>CNA1</italic> or <italic>CRZ1</italic> in <italic>C. albicans gcn5</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; to investigate the interplay between Gcn5, Cas5, and the calcineurin pathway under CAS stress. Our results demonstrated that <italic>CAS5</italic> and <italic>CNA1</italic> overexpression, but not <italic>CRZ1</italic>, significantly enhanced the resistance of the <italic>C. albicans gcn5</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; mutant to CAS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Interestingly, while Crz1 is the primary transcription factor in the calcineurin pathway, the <italic>C. auris crz1</italic>&#x00394; mutant did not exhibit the heightened CAS sensitivity observed in the <italic>cna1</italic>&#x00394; mutant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). This suggests that Cna1-mediated echinocandin resistance in <italic>C. auris</italic> is not regulated through Crz1. In contrast, the CAS sensitivity of the <italic>cas5</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>cna1</italic>&#x00394; mutants closely mirrored each other, with both strains also showing comparable hypersensitivity to elevated calcium concentrations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Further supporting this connection, overexpression of <italic>CAS5</italic> or <italic>CNA1</italic> in the <italic>C. albicans gcn5</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; mutant restored resistance to CAS to a comparable extent (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Consequently, we hypothesize that the Gcn5-Cna1-Cas5 axis may represent a key epigenetic regulatory pathway responsible for <italic>C. auris</italic> resistance to echinocandins. To confirm this model, further research is warranted to elucidate how Gcn5 regulates Cna1 and whether Cas5 overexpression or activation through phosphorylation site mutations can restore echinocandin resistance in <italic>cna1</italic>&#x00394; mutants. Interestingly, previous studies have indicated that Crz1 does not play a major role in echinocandin resistance in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, while it is crucial for <italic>N. glabratus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Further investigations are required to explore the functional differences of Crz1 across various <italic>Candida</italic> species.</p><p id="Par29">Additionally, our study revealed an intriguing phenomenon: deletion of <italic>GCN5</italic> resulted in opposite changes in MCF resistance between CBS12767 and yCB799. We speculate that this may be a result of at least two contributing factors. First, it is likely that MCF may triggers the expression of uncharacterized MCF-specific, <italic>GCN5</italic>-dependent target genes which are different from that of CAS, and more importantly, these genes function in a strain-dependent manner (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4c, e</xref>). Second, sequencing the <italic>FKS1</italic> and <italic>FKS2</italic> gene loci both in yCB799 and CBS12767 strains identified that only yCB799 <italic>FKS1</italic> gene harbors two mutations (S639F and L906S). S639F is known to be associated with echinocandin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> and the role of L906S remains unclear. It is possible that <italic>FKS1</italic> mutation may be attributed to the different susceptibility of the two strains to MCF. However, somehow the mutation has no impact on CAS action. Possibly the structure differences between MCF and CAS may reflect their distinct roles in gene regulation.</p><p id="Par30">Furthermore, our findings that <italic>gcn5</italic>&#x00394; mutants exhibit significantly reduced pathogenicity and are more readily cleared from host tissues emphasize the role of Gcn5 as a virulence factor (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). Although the exact mechanisms by which Gcn5 influences pathogenicity remain partially elucidated, its involvement in cell wall integrity and calcium ion regulation may account for the observed decrease in virulence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, f&#x02013;h</xref>). Previous reports indicate that in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>N. glabratus</italic>, knockout of Gcn5 or the Spt7 or Spt8 subunits of the SAGA complex results in increased sensitivity to phagocytosis and enhanced killing by macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">The slow progress in antifungal drug development highlights the urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches. Current antifungal strategies typically target fungal cell membranes, cell walls, and stress response pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Encouragingly, our research indicates that Gcn5 influences several critical processes, including cell wall structure, ergosterol biosynthesis, and the calcineurin pathway. Given its significant role in both virulence and resistance in <italic>C. auris</italic>, Gcn5 emerges as a promising target for combating invasive infections. Among the Gcn5 inhibitors evaluated, CPTH<sub>2</sub> demonstrates notable efficacy by selectively targeting specific histone H3 acetylation modifications, such as H3K14Ac, H3K18Ac, and H3K36Ac, while exerting minimal impact on others like H3K9Ac, H3K27Ac, and H3K56Ac (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). This selective inhibition may explain why CPTH<sub>2</sub> exhibits a synergistic effect only with CAS, but not with FLC, in both in vitro and in vivo studies. To validate these observations, further research is needed, including site-directed mutagenesis to explore the role of specific Gcn5-regulated histone H3 acetylation sites. Additionally, developing more precise and effective Gcn5 inhibitors could potentially reduce <italic>C. auris</italic> resistance and enhance treatment outcomes. Moreover, <italic>C. auris</italic> not only demonstrates inherent multidrug resistance but can also rapidly develop additional resistance when exposed to antifungal treatments. The ineffective eradication of <italic>C. auris</italic> during therapy poses a risk of disease relapse or treatment failure. Currently, echinocandins represent the primary treatment for <italic>C. auris</italic> infections, but resistance during CAS therapy has been documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Our research highlights that both knockout and targeted inhibition of Gcn5 significantly bolster the fungicidal activity of CAS against <italic>C. auris</italic>, irrespective of whether the strain is sensitive or resistant to echinocandins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, e</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e-h</xref>). These findings suggest that combining CAS with Gcn5 inhibition could be a promising strategy for treating invasive <italic>C. auris</italic> infections and mitigating the risk of developing resistance. To assess the long-term viability of this approach, we investigated whether <italic>C. auris</italic> evolves compensatory mechanisms under sustained Gcn5 inhibition. While the wild-type strain CBS12767 developed partial resistance to histone H3 acetylation inhibition after prolonged in vitro exposure to CPTH<sub>2</sub> (10&#x02009;days at high concentrations), no such resistance emerged during in vivo exposure over 14&#x02009;days. These results imply that when administered at a daily in vivo dosage of 40&#x02009;mg/kg for a duration of 14&#x02009;days, CPTH<sub>2</sub> continues to be efficacious in targeting histone H3 acetylation in <italic>C. auris</italic>. Nevertheless, under extreme in vitro conditions where the concentration of CPTH<sub>2</sub> is 8&#x02009;&#x003bc;M or higher, resistance to the inhibition of histone H3 acetylation can arise within 10&#x02009;days. This vividly demonstrate the extraordinary adaptability of <italic>C. auris</italic> under intense stress. As a result, it emphasizes the necessity for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms involved, which should be crucial for devising more effective strategies to impede the global dissemination of <italic>C. auris</italic>.</p><p id="Par32">A significant challenge in antifungal drug development is differentiating between human and fungal eukaryotic mechanisms to ensure targeted treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Gcn5, an enzyme highly conserved across various species, raises concerns regarding drug specificity. Nevertheless, preliminary safety assessments indicate that Gcn5 in <italic>C. auris</italic> is more susceptible to the inhibitor CPTH<sub>2</sub> compared to human cells, with no acute toxicity detected in mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>). Relevant studies also show that silencing Gcn5 expression or using MB-3 to inhibit Gcn5 activity does not significantly affect the viability or maturation of human cells. However, these approaches effectively enhance the therapeutic response to all-trans retinoic acid in non-acute promyelocytic leukemia acute myeloid leukemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that targeting Gcn5 could be an effective strategy for treating invasive <italic>C. auris</italic> infections while minimizing host toxicity.</p><p id="Par33">In conclusion, our study elucidates the critical role of histone H3 PTMs in the resistance and pathogenicity of <italic>C. auris</italic>.

Treatment commenced 4&#x02009;h post-infection, with subsequent doses administered every 12&#x02009;h. The number of doses varied by experiment. Fungal burdens in the kidneys, liver, spleen, and lungs were assessed 12&#x02009;h after the final dose, following the same protocol described above. Caspofungin (MCE, HY-17006), CPTH<sub>2</sub> (MCE, HY-W013274), and fluconazole (Sigma-Aldrich, PHR1160-1G) were used in the study. Drugs were prepared as 20&#x000d7; stock solutions in DMSO. For experiments involving only caspofungin and fluconazole, these drugs were diluted to a 1&#x000d7; concentration with sterile PBS. CPTH<sub>2</sub> was prepared in a solution containing 10% DMSO, 40% PEG300, 5% Tween-80, and 45% PBS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="Par60">The figure legends detail statistical parameters, including the exact sample size (n) and measures of statistical significance.
