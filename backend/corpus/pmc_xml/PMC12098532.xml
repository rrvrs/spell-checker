In the retina, glycinergic neurotransmission is primarily used by amacrine cells that are involved in the lateral processing of visual stimuli in the inner retina. We have previously shown that the high-affinity glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1), that is commonly used as a reliable marker for glycinergic amacrine cells in the retina, is essential for glycinergic neurotransmission by these cells. Abolishment of retinal GlyT1 expression results in a breakdown of glycinergic neurotransmission by AII amacrine cells, but most likely also by other glycinergic amacrine cell populations. However, the impact of loss of glycinergic neurotransmission on retinal signal processing and visually guided behavior, has not yet been elucidated. In this study, the effects of loss of retinal GlyT1 expression in glycinergic amacrine cells on the optomotor reflex and on the photopic and scotopic electroretinogram (ERG) responses were analyzed. We show that retinal GlyT1-deficient mice have normal optomotor responses to rotating black and white stripes. When stimuli with sawtooth luminance profiles were used, thereby differentially activating ON and OFF pathways, the GlyT1 deficient mice showed facilitated responses to ON preferring stimuli, whereas responses to OFF preferring stimuli were unchanged. These findings were corroborated by ERG recordings that showed undistinguishable responses after flash stimulation but revealed differences in the differential processing of ON and OFF preferring stimuli. To determine if the function of retinal GlyT1 is conserved in humans, we analyzed ERG recordings from a patient diagnosed with GlyT1 encephalopathy. We show that GlyT1 deficiency results in marked ERG changes, characterized by an almost complete loss of the &#x0201c;photopic hill&#x0201d; phenomenon, a hill-like appearance of the relationship between the b-wave amplitude and log light stimulus strength under background illumination conditions, and reductions in the ERG oscillatory potentials in the dark- and light-adapted states. Both findings are consistent with an altered interaction between ON- and OFF pathways in the retina. Taken together our data show that glycinergic neurotransmission in the retina has important functions in retinal ON and OFF processing both in mice and humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>glycine</kwd><kwd>synaptic inhibition</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>amacrine cells</kwd><kwd>ERG</kwd><kwd>ON-OFF signalling</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="52"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="9335"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>section-at-acceptance</meta-name><meta-value>Brain Disease Mechanisms</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Glycine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), predominantly in the caudal regions, but also the retina. At glycinergic synapses, binding of glycine to postsynaptic glycine receptors (GlyR) results in an increase in chloride conductance and (in most cells of the mature nervous system) triggers a hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic cell (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Legendre, 2001</xref>), thereby leading to a sign inversion of the electrical signal across chemical synapses. In the caudal regions of the CNS, glycinergic neurotransmission is controlled by two high affinity glycine transporters, GlyT1 and GlyT2 (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Eulenburg and Hulsmann, 2022</xref>). Loss-of-function studies in mice demonstrated that GlyT2 mediates the reuptake of glycine from the extracellular space into the presynaptic terminal, thus providing substrates for refilling of synaptic vesicles in glycinergic neurons (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Gomeza et al., 2003b</xref>). In contrast, GlyT1 is responsible for the clearance of glycine from the synaptic cleft, by transporting it into surrounding glial cells (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Gomeza et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Eulenburg et al., 2010</xref>). In humans, mutations in the GlyT1 gene result in a disease phenotype named GlyT1 encephalopathy (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Alfadhel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Kurolap et al., 2016</xref>), which resembles most aspects of the phenotype seen in mice and displays many, but not all, facets of nonketotic hyperglycinemia, a rare inborn metabolic disorder associated with mutations in the glycine cleavage system (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Applegarth and Toone, 2004</xref>). To date, at least ten individuals from six different families carrying different mutations in the GlyT1 gene were identified (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Alfadhel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Kurolap et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Hauf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Mademont-Soler et al., 2021</xref>), all demonstrating impaired transporter activity, thus suggesting GlyT1 dysfunction to be causative for the disease (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Hauf et al., 2020</xref>). The most frequently reported symptoms include respiratory failure, hypotonia, arthrogryposis and increased nuchal translucency on prenatal ultrasound (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Alfallaj and Alfadhel, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the retina, glycinergic amacrine cells are known to form glycinergic synapses onto bipolar cells and ganglion cells, thus modulating retinal output (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">W&#x000e4;ssle et al., 2009</xref>). Bipolar- and ganglion cells are part of the vertical signaling pathway in the retina whereas the amacrine cells are part of the lateral processing mechanism. Lateral processing in the proximal retina is achieved by a well ordered but complex microcircuitry involving several highly-specialized cell types, including over 60 known types of amacrine cells, releasing different neurotransmitters and showing different connectivity and stratifications (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Baden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2020</xref>). From these, 43 have been described as exclusively GABAergic and 13 express glycinergic markers (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2020</xref>). Details of the function of the different amacrine cell types and the consequences of their dysfunction are not yet fully understood.</p><p>In retinal glycinergic amacrine cells, only GlyT1 is expressed and was suggested to be essential for the maintenance of high intracellular glycine concentrations within the glycinergic neurons and for low glycine concentration in the extracellular space (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Pow, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Pow and Hendrickson, 2000</xref>). In agreement with this proposal, loss of GlyT1 expression resulted in a breakdown of glycinergic neurotransmission transduced by AII amacrine cells (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Eulenburg et al., 2018</xref>) and in marked changes in the signal transmission mediated by these cells. The functional consequences of the changed glycinergic neurotransmission on retinal information processing and on vision have yet to be elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the functional effects of retinal GlyT1 deficiency in a mouse model of retina-specific GlyT1 deficiency (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Eulenburg et al., 2018</xref>) showing complete loss of GlyT1 expression in AII amacrine cells and possibly also in other glycinergic amacrine cell types. In addition, using ERG recording, we studied the retinal function in a human subject diagnosed with GlyT1 encephalopathy due to general functional GlyT1 deficiency. We show significantly altered optomotor reflexes (OMRs) in the GlyT1 deficient mice, demonstrating the importance of GlyT1 for proper retinal function and visual behavior. These effects are expressed by asymmetric changes in the retinal ON- and OFF-pathway as established by electroretinography (ERG). Different alterations in the ON- and OFF-pathways were also found in the ERGs obtained from the GlyT1 encephalopathy patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3"><label>2.1</label><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the local regulations of the Animal Care and Use Committee and approved by the Regierung of Mittelfranken (Ref. No: 54.2532.1&#x02013;15/10 and 54&#x02013;2532.1-25/13). All experiments were performed on adult C57BL/6J mice of the indicated genotype. Animals had access to food and water ad libitum and were maintained at a 12/12&#x0202f;h light&#x02013;dark cycle. Mice of both sexes were used. No gender-related differences were observed in the experiments performed in this study. Retinal specific inactivation of GlyT1 expression was achieved by mating of mice carrying a floxed GlyT1 allele (GlyT1<sup>fl</sup>) (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Eulenburg et al., 2010</xref>) with mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of a BAC transgenic GlyT2 promoter (GlyT2-Cre) (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Ishihara et al., 2010</xref>). Genotyping was performed on genomic DNA isolated from ear biopsy material by PCR using the primers 201/301 (GCAACCTGTCTCACCTGTTCAAC and TGTAGGAAGAATACCCCACTGCG) binding to the genomic region upstream of Exon 3 of the mouse GlyT1 gene, flanking the insertion site of the first LoxP site, and Cre001/Cre101 (ATTGCCTACAACACCCTGCTGC and CCACACCATTCTTTCTGACCCG) binding to the coding region of the Cre recombinase. For simplicity mice with the genotype GlyT1<sup>fl/fl</sup> / GlyT2-Cre were named GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> throughout the manuscript. Previous characterization of this mouse line (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Eulenburg et al., 2018</xref>) has demonstrated that it carries a retina specific inactivation of GlyT1 expression in all AII amacrine cells and additionally some other -not jet identified- glycinergic amacrine cell populations.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>2.2</label><title>Analysis of the optomotor responses in mice</title><p>The optomotor response (OMR) was measured by visual tracking in an optokinetic drum.

Infrared illumination (&#x0003e;800&#x0202f;nm) was used to obtain infrared movies of the mice with an infrared sensitive camera (Sony). For mouse handling under reduced light intensities, the investigator was equipped with a night vision device. The walls of the drums were illuminated by 3&#x0202f;V white light LED, coupled to three light guiding fibers.

Briefly, animals were dark-adapted overnight prior to ERG measurements. Dim red illumination was used during animal preparation to maintain dark adaptation. Animals were anesthetized by an intramuscular (i.m.) injection of 50&#x0202f;mg/kg ketamine (Ketavet&#x000ae;, Pfizer) and 10&#x0202f;mg/kg xylazine (Rompun&#x000ae; 2%, Bayer). A subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of saline (300&#x0202f;&#x003bc;L, 0.9%) was delivered to avoid dehydration during anesthesia. The pupils were dilated by a drop of Tropicamide (Mydriaticum Stulln&#x000ae;, 5&#x0202f;mg/mL, Pharma Stulln GmbH) and phenylephrine-hydrochloride (Neosynephrin POS&#x000ae; 5%, Ursapharm). The animal was then placed on a heated platform inside a Ganzfeld stimulator (Roland Consult Q450 SC). Needle electrodes were placed s.c. at the tail base and on the forehead between the eyes, serving, respectively, as ground and reference electrodes. Contact lens electrodes (&#x000d8;3.2&#x0202f;mm; Mayo Corporation) filled with Corneregel&#x000ae; (Dr. Mann Pharma) served as active electrodes. The mice were allowed 10&#x0202f;min of dark adaptation. Recordings (RetiPort system; Roland Consult) included the scotopic threshold response (STR; white LED flashes, &#x02212;4.5, &#x02212;4.4, and &#x02212;4.3 log phot cd.s/m<sup>2</sup>, 60&#x02013;80 averages; white LEDs: 1 phot cd.s/m<sup>2</sup>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;1.624 scot cd.s/m<sup>2</sup>), to assay rod-driven retinal ganglion cell physiology (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Saszik et al., 2002</xref>) followed by mesopic rapid-ON/OFF 4&#x0202f;Hz sawtooth paradigms (red LEDs, 0 log phot cd/m<sup>2</sup> after 5&#x0202f;min adaptation, 80&#x0202f;s measurements; red LEDs: 1 phot cd/m<sup>2</sup>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.04 scot cd/m<sup>2</sup>) to assess ON- and OFF-retinal activity separately (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Kremers et al., 2014</xref>) Lastly, a scotopic flash ERG protocol was recorded (2&#x0202f;min of adaptation, &#x02212;0.7, 0.3, 0.8 log phot cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> white LED flashes, 4&#x02013;8 averages) to examine outer retinal function (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Frishman, 2006</xref>). The total duration of scotopic ERG measurements was approx. 45&#x0202f;min. Photopic measurements were done on a second cohort of mice after 5&#x0202f;min adaptation to white light background (25 phot cd/m<sup>2</sup> equals 1.4 log phot cd/m<sup>2</sup>). Photopic recordings included photopic white light flashes, &#x02212;0.2, 0.3, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 log phot cd.s/m<sup>2</sup>, 20 averages, to examine the integrity of cone-driven responses in the outer retina and ganglion cells (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Frishman, 2006</xref>), and a photopic rapid-ON/OFF 4&#x0202f;Hz sawtooth paradigm (60 phot cd/m<sup>2</sup>&#x02013;1.8 log phot cd/m<sup>2</sup> - white light, after 5&#x0202f;min adaptation, 40&#x0202f;s measurement) to investigate a possible effect of the GlyT1 knockout on cone-driven ON- and OFF-responses. The total duration of the photopic measurements was approximately 20&#x0202f;min.</p><p>ERG responses were amplified 100,000 times, band-pass filtered (1&#x02013;300&#x0202f;Hz) and digitized with a sampling frequency of either 2,048&#x0202f;Hz for flash ERGs or 1,024&#x0202f;Hz for sawtooth and sine flicker ERGs (RetiPort system; Roland Consult, Brandenburg, Germany). All data were analyzed with custom written Matlab (The Math Works) programs. To isolate the oscillatory potentials from a- and b-wave in flash ERG responses, a variable filter was used on the Fourier transform of the response. In the frequency domain, the amplitude plot showed two regions that were separated by a minimum at about 60&#x0202f;Hz. The low frequency portion was attributed to the a- and b-wave and PhNR, whereas the high frequency portion was exclusively attributed to the faster oscillatory potentials [OPs; (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Harazny et al., 2009</xref>)] We defined the amplitude of the OPs as the maximal amplitude of the high frequency portion between 60 and 100&#x0202f;Hz. The amplitudes and latencies of the a- and b-wave and the photopic negative response (PhNR) of flash ERGs were obtained after inverse Fourier transform of the low frequency portion. The components were defined as follows (illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>): amplitude of the a-wave was measured from baseline (the first five data points of recording) to the trough of the a-wave. The amplitude of the b-wave was defined as the amplitude between the trough of the a-wave to the peak of the b-wave. Latencies were calculated from time-of-flash to trough or peak. As the photopic a-wave is small in mice (&#x0003c; 10&#x0202f;&#x003bc;V), it was disregarded. For the photopic flash ERG, the amplitude of the PhNR was measured from baseline to its trough. Since the PhNR is a very slow wave component, it can be contaminated by slow potentials caused by breathing activity. To minimize this effect, we calculated the area under the response curve in a time window between 75 and 125 ms post-flash (denoted as PhNR area). The responses of the two eyes of each animal were averaged, if the difference of the maximum b-wave amplitude (at 0.8 log phot cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> flash for scotopic conditions and at 1.2 log phot cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> for photopic conditions) between the two eyes was smaller than 10%. If the difference was larger than 10%, only the eye with the larger amplitude was included in the analysis.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Scotopic flash-ERGs.

The ERG responses were simultaneously recorded from both eyes (UTAS BigShot, LKC Technologies, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA) after pupil dilation and topical corneal analgesia. DTL corneal electrodes were used as active electrodes and cup EEG electrodes, placed on the temporal canthus of each eye as reference electrode, and a common ground electrode was placed on the forehead between the two eyes. The light-adapted ERG was recorded under white background illumination of 30&#x0202f;cd/m<sup>2</sup>, using white light stimuli of increasing strengths covering a range of approximately 3.3 log units (0.1 to 200&#x0202f;cd.s/m<sup>2</sup>) in addition to a 30-Hz flicker (2.5&#x0202f;cd.s/m<sup>2</sup>).

As a readout, we used the frequency of head-movement, caused by the optokinetic nystagmus elicited by a rotating drum surrounding the animal (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Tauber and Atkin, 1968</xref>). In complete darkness or under very low luminance conditions, wild-type mice did not show any head movement associated with the rotating black and white stripe pattern (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref>,<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Robust OMRs were observed under scotopic luminance between &#x02212;5.5 and &#x02212;4 log (cd/m<sup>2</sup>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The OMR frequency was dependent on the mean luminance, but independent of the direction of rotation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). When these experiments were repeated with GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-cre</sup> mice, they showed reflexes that were indistinguishable from those of wild-type animals. Similar results were obtained at luminance levels that favor photopic signaling pathways in the retina (&#x0003e; 400&#x0202f;cd phot/m<sup>2</sup>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In summary, our results demonstrated that GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice did not show altered visual evoked behavior, compared to wild-type mice, in response to the rotating black and white stripe pattern under a wide range of illumination conditions, from darkness to bright photopic conditions.</p><p>To specifically target changes in ON- and/or OFF-specific pathways, we used gratings with sawtooth spatial luminance profiles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). These stimuli may differentially activate ON- and OFF-signal-induced reflexes, depending on the direction of the rotation.</p><p>Again, under complete darkness, no OMRs were observed independent of the direction of rotation. Wild-type mice showed similar frequency of OMRs regardless of the direction of rotation under photopic conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;0.5), revealing no measurable differences between ON- and OFF-mediated responses. When these experiments were repeated with GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice, however, a significantly increased number of OMRs in response to a photopic stimulus preferring activation of the ON-channels (rapid-ON) were observed as compared to those of wild-type animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x02264;&#x0202f;0.005). In contrast, the OMRs to stimuli preferring OFF signaling in the retina (rapid-OFF stimuli) were like those of the wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x02265;&#x0202f;0.5). To determine if this difference is specific for photopic conditions or if it is also present under scotopic conditions, the experiment was repeated under scotopic luminance conditions. At &#x02212;5.5 Log (cd /m<sup>2</sup>), all mice showed almost no reactions. At all other luminance, wild-type mice showed similar reaction frequencies to rapid-ON and -OFF stimuli. In contrast, GlyT1<sup>Glyt2-cre</sup> mice displayed significantly more OMRs to rapid-ON than to rapid-OFF stimuli (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x02264;&#x0202f;0.005) as it was also seen under photopic luminance.

The scotopic threshold response (STR) and the scotopic flash ERG (after removal of the oscillatory potentials &#x02013; OPs) did not differ significantly between wild-type and GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>,<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>; for quantification see, B, E; <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x02265;&#x0202f;0.5).

Here, the photopic b-wave amplitude was slightly, but not significantly increased in GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> upper left plot; <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;0.05). The b-wave implicit time was slightly delayed in GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice and reached significance only for 1 log cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> flashes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> lower left plot; Kruskal-Wallis test: <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x02264;&#x0202f;0.005 after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing). The averaged photopic flash-ERG waveforms between about 60 and 180&#x0202f;ms post stimulus was more positive in the GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice when compared with those of wild-type mice. Based on these findings, we assumed that the amplitude of the photopic negative response (PhNR) &#x02013; a slow component which represents ganglion cell activity (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Frishman, 2006</xref>) &#x02013; might be significantly altered in GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice. We, therefore, determined the minimum within this time window and calculated the potential difference relative to baseline (positive values indicating that the potential was below baseline). Owing to the large inter-individual differences, the ERG responses did not differ significantly between the two groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> upper right plot). Reassessment of the data revealed that the GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice could be sub-classified into two groups: one in which the late potential was similar to that of the wild-type mice (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;4; here called GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> #1), and a second group with altered late potentials (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;4; called GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> #2). To classify the GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice we defined a threshold using the wild type data. If the PhNR amplitude of a GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mouse was above our criterion (defined as WT mean + 2*WT standard deviation) the animal was assigned to the GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup>#2 group. The average ERGs of these groups are shown with those of wild-type mice for the three strongest flashes in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>. We quantified the PhNR amplitude as the area under the ERG traces between 75 and 125&#x0202f;ms post-stimulus (shown as shaded areas in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The amplitudes for the three groups are given in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>. A statistical analysis of these data is not useful because the division between the two GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> groups was based on the late potentials themselves and, therefore, these data should be regarded as an empirical observation. We did not find any common distinction between the two subgroups other than the PhNR. There was no indication that sex or age had an effect on the trace of the PhNR. All animals were recorded by the same researcher with the same equipment.</p><p>To separate responses to luminance increments (ON-) and decrements (OFF-), two stimulus types with sawtooth temporal profiles were used (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Pangeni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Kremers et al., 2014</xref>); a rapid-ON ramp-OFF and a rapid-OFF ramp-ON to elicit mainly ON- and OFF-responses, respectively. The responses were measured under mesopic (1&#x0202f;cd/m<sup>2</sup>) and photopic (60&#x0202f;cd/m<sup>2</sup>) conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref>,<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">D</xref> respectively). In both mesopic and photopic conditions, the amplitudes of the ON- and OFF-responses were slightly increased in the GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> compared to those of the wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> upper plot for mesopic conditions; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> upper plot for photopic conditions). Moreover, the latency of the minimum in the OFF-response (N<sub>OFF</sub>) was significantly increased in the GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice at mesopic conditions (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.034, Mann&#x02013;Whitney-U test). This asymmetry between ON- and OFF-responses is more obvious when the responses are summed (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Pangeni et al., 2012</xref>). This summation shows three components, marked as N1, P1 and LN (traces in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref>,<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">F</xref> for mesopic and photopic conditions, respectively). The ON&#x02013;OFF asymmetries were increased in GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice; this increase was significant for the P1 component both in mesopic (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.004, Mann&#x02013;Whitney-U-test) and in photopic (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.029, Mann&#x02013;Whitney-U test) conditions. To exclude that the observed effect was solely caused by the outliers, a reanalysis of the data was performed after exclusion of these datapoints, which confirmed the significant difference of P1 between genotypes.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Mesopic and photopic sawtooth-ERGs.

The scotopic responses recorded in the dark-adapted state demonstrated mild reduction of the ERG a-wave and b-wave amplitudes, indicating slightly subnormal rod system function in the peripheral retina (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, left-upper part). The a-wave of the ERG responses that were recorded under light-adapted conditions, are of slightly subnormal amplitudes in response to all light stimuli of all strengths (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, left lower part). The findings of slightly subnormal amplitudes of ERG a-wave and b-wave under light- and dark-adapted conditions are consistent with previous reports on age-related development of the human ERG (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Fulton et al., 2005</xref>). However, the light-adapted amplitude-Log I relationship for the light-adapted b-wave showed a monotonic increase in amplitude with increasing stimulus strength, reaching a stable plateau at high stimulus strengths (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, right lower part curve with solid squares). This observation contrasts with the &#x0201c;photopic hill &#x0201c;phenomenon that is readily seen when plotting the light-adapted b-wave amplitude as a function of log stimulus strength in subjects with normal retinal function (<xref rid="ref9001" ref-type="bibr">Wali and Leguire, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="ref9002" ref-type="bibr">Rufiange et al., 2002</xref>) as illustrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> (open circles in right lower part) showing the mean +/&#x02212; s.d. of 20 adult volunteers with normal visual function.

We demonstrated that wild-type mice and GlyT1GlyT2-Cre mice showed indistinguishable behavior in response to rotating black and white bars, confirming that the overall processing of visual information is still functional in GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice. When using stimuli that may differentially stimulate retinal ON- and OFF- pathways, GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice showed significantly increased oculomotor reflexes (OMRs) in reaction to ON-stimuli compared to wild-type littermates, suggesting an overall stronger retinal signal. Indeed, previous studies have shown that an inhibition of glycine in the retina by strychnine can result in a facilitation of the electrical activity of ON direction sensitive ganglion cells (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Sivyer et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together these findings are consistent with our previous studies on these mice showing that retinal GlyT1 deficiency results in a breakdown of glycinergic inhibition at least in major populations of glycinergic amacrine cells (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Eulenburg et al., 2018</xref>). A possible mechanistic explanation for this effect could be changes in the activity of starburst amacrine cells, that have been shown previously to be involved in the modulation of the activity of direction sensitive ganglion cells (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>). Starburst amacrine cells have been shown to use acetylcholine and/or GABA but not glycine as a neurotransmitter (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Sethuramanujam et al., 2016</xref>), thus a direct influence of GlyT1 deficiency on this cell type is at least unlikely. Although the majority of the inhibitory input onto starburst amacrine cells has been ascribed to be GABAergic input, some glycinergic input has also been reported (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Majumdar et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, this glycinergic input has been shown to be involved in direction sensitive ON activity of this cell type and this effect was shown to be mediated predominantly by the glycine receptor subunit &#x003b1;4 (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2022</xref>). On ganglion cell level, additional direct glycinergic input onto the ON direction sensitive ganglion cells from VGlut3 positive cells has been shown that most likely use both glutamate and glycine as transmitters (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Mani et al., 2023</xref>). Here, the glycine dependency might additionally influenced by the stimulus frequency, where higher velocities show stronger glycinergic components (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Summers and Feller, 2022</xref>). Further investigation is required to establish a firm causal relationship between alterations in glycine dependent signal transmission and the described behavioral phenotype.</p><p>In contrast to the OMRs in response to ON preferring stimuli the number of OMRs to OFF-preferring stimuli were similar in both groups independent of the level of illumination, suggesting that the retinal derived signal eliciting this behavioral response is not changed. This contrasts with our previous study which demonstrated that in GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice show significantly diminished OFF responses most likely caused by defective glycinergic neurotransmission via AII amacrine cells (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Eulenburg et al., 2018</xref>). AII amacrine cells have been shown to be critical for the propagation of OFF-stimuli at least under scotopic conditions (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Bloomfield and Dacheux, 2001</xref>), but there is also evidence that AII amacrine cells are also involved in the processing of cone-mediated photopic visual stimuli (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Manookin et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, defective glycinergic signaling via AII amacrine cells is predicted to diminish OFF-signaling. This, however, is not seen in our behavioral analysis, suggesting that at least glycinergic neurotransmission involving AII amacrine cells does not contribute to this behavioral response. We cannot exclude, however, that a decreased inhibition caused by OFF-signals (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Rabl et al., 2002</xref>) contributes to the observed increased reaction to ON preferring stimuli by a decreased crossover inhibition.</p><p>Consistent with the behavioral data, the ERG recordings confirmed that the overall signal processing within the retina of GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice is not severely affected, since only moderate changes were observed. These findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that the GlyR inhibitor strychnine has only moderate effects on ERGs recorded in rodents. It was reported previously that strychnine, a glycine receptor antagonist, caused a significant decrease in the amplitude of the OPs in the mouse retina (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2023</xref>). In GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice, however, significant OP reductions were not observed. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that not all glycinergic amacrine cells are affected by GlyT2-Cre mediated GlyT1 gene inactivation (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Eulenburg et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, GABAergic amacrine cells continue to support the generation of OPs and these might compensate at least partially the lack of glycinergic input.</p><p>Our detailed ERG recordings and analyses, including the assessment of the PhNR and the responses to sawtooth stimuli, indicate an asymmetry of the effects of retina specific GlyT1 deficiency on ON- and OFF-specific signal processing. These are consistent with previous findings showing distinct processing of ON- and OFF-signaling in the retina (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Bowen et al., 1992</xref>), and extend these data by demonstrating differences in the involvement of glycinergic neurotransmission. Furthermore, these findings support the hypothesis that the defects in retinal processing observed in GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice are elicited within the inner retina. The observed heterogeneity of the effect of retinal GlyT1 deficiency on the PhNR suggests in addition to the AII amacrine cell at least one subtype of glycinergic amacrine cells is affected by the retinal GlyT1 gene inactivation in our GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mouse line. Here, however, apparently only incomplete penetrance of GlyT1 inactivation is achieved. Which specific amacrine cell type is responsible for this effect, however, is unclear at present and requires further investigation. This, appears not to play a role for the observed behavioral effects, since a similar segregation of the behavior of GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice into discernable groups was not observed. Previous studies have shown, that at least in culture GlyT1 expression is also observed in M&#x000fc;ller cells (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Gadea et al., 1999</xref>), i.e., a retinal glial cell, which opens up the possibility that also this cell type contributes to changes in behavior and ERG induced by retinal GlyT1 deficiency. When analyzing GlyT1 expression in the retina, we found no expression in this cell type (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Eulenburg et al., 2018</xref>) making this possibility highly unlikely.</p><p>As described above, previous studies have shown that in rodents, some of the effects described in this study might be mediated by glycine receptors of the GlyR &#x003b1;4 subtype (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2022</xref>). Since this subtype is predicted to be a pseudogene in humans, it is questionably if differences caused by GlyT1 deficiency are also detectable in humans. This question was addressed by our study of ERGs from a patient suffering from genetic induced GlyT1 deficiency. Here, no apparent structural defects were observed by imaging techniques in the patient retina and retinal function, as determined from ERG recording, indicated no apparent changes in scotopic function. In the photopic flash ERGs, however, the &#x0201c;photopic hill&#x0201d; phenomenon was missing. The amplitude decrease of the b-wave at high flash strengths that results in the establishment of the &#x0201c;photopic hill&#x0201d; in healthy humans has been attributed to the algebraic summation of the ON- and OFF-responses of the cone system during background illumination (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Garon et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the &#x0201c;photopic hill&#x0201d; phenomenon is believed to arise from the simultaneous responses of the ON-bipolar cells and of the OFF-bipolar cells to the instantaneous light stimulus (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Garon et al., 2014</xref>). Here, the abolishment of the &#x0201c;photopic hill&#x0201d; phenomenon in the patient suffering from GlyT1 deficiency is consistent with a selective lowering of the contributions of OFF-bipolar cells to the ERG under background illumination. Unfortunately, a more extensive ERG analysis on the patient, also including a detailed assessment of ERG responses to ON/OFF sawtooth profiles was not possible, thus precluding a direct comparison of this aspect to our data obtained in GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-cre</sup> mice.</p><p>This influence of GlyT1 deficiency on the light adapted flash ERG of humans can be associated with the prolonged b-wave kinetic in the photopic flash ERG in GlyT1<sup>GlyT2-Cre</sup> mice. In rodents, however, no photopic hill effect can be observed, consistent with the findings that cones represent less than 3% of the photoreceptors in mice (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Jeon et al., 1998</xref>) compared to about 5% cones in the human retina (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Molday and Moritz, 2015</xref>). Therefore, a b-wave, that is predominantly carried by cone photoreceptors is nearly nonexistent (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Gilmour et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate that GlyT1 deficiency result in significant changes in signaling processing in the inner retina of rodents and of a human patient, consistent with significant functional alteration of glycinergic amacrine cells within the inner retina. Although the core findings are different in mice and man, the underlying mechanism, i.e., the breakdown of glycinergic neurotransmission in the retina induced by GlyT1 deficiency is most likely the same. Whether the different defects detected in the human patient and in our mouse model for retinal GlyT1 deficiency are caused by dysfunction of the same glycinergic amacrine cell population, however, is at least questionable. Here, the precise mechanisms underlying the observed changes, however, remain unclear at present and deserve further investigation in future studies. The observed apparent differences between mouse and man underscores the importance for a detailed comparison of findings in different species to investigate the potential and validity of animal models for specific aspects of human diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank R.
