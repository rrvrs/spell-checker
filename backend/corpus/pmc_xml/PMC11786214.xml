These diseases caused the illness and death of many people. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors and consequences of the spread of infectious diseases in Ardabil during the first Pahlavi period. The research method is descriptive and historical-retrospective, which tries to answer the research questions using documentary and library sources. The findings show that malaria, trachoma, smallpox, tuberculosis, rinderpest, venereal diseases, and diphtheria were among the most common infectious diseases. Poverty, illiteracy, poor public health, lack of medical facilities, and the geographical location were the main factors in the spread of these diseases. Considering the critical nature of the issue, the first Pahlavi government tried to control and prevent diseases by carrying out measures such as public education, establishing health and treatment centers and reforming their structure, sending doctors and distributing medicine, and implementing quarantine and vaccination. The results showed that the efforts of the first Pahlavi government in fighting infectious diseases in Ardabil were relatively successful and reduced the prevalence of some diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ardabil</kwd><kwd>First Pahlavi period</kwd><kwd>Health</kwd><kwd>History of medicine</kwd><kwd>Infectious diseases</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p>

During the Safavid era, the plague, one of the deadliest diseases, repeatedly ravaged Ardabil and other parts of Iran. The plague of 1573, which killed approximately 30&#x02005;000 people in Ardabil, was one of the most devastating outbreaks.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In 1624, a deadly contagious disease spread throughout the regions of Ardabil, Khalkhal, and Sarab, claiming the lives of nearly 100&#x02005;000 people.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The prevalence of infectious diseases continued in Ardabil and other regions during the Qajar era. In 1832, cholera and plague spread in Ardabil.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p> Based on this, one of the most important public health challenges in Ardabil during the first Pahlavi period (1925-1941 AD) was the spread of contagious infectious diseases.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Diseases such as cholera, plague, smallpox, and typhoid, not only threatened people&#x02019;s health but also had profound effects on social structures. Among the main consequences of the spread of infectious diseases, we can mention the increase in the death rate, increase in treatment costs, decrease in production and productivity, and damage to economic development.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p> Despite the importance of the issue, there is no comprehensive information about the spread of infectious diseases in Ardabil during the first Pahlavi period, and the available historical sources provide scattered and incomplete information about this issue.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Despite examining the health and treatment situation, these researches did not pay much attention to the prevalence, causes and consequences of diseases in Ardabil and only made a brief reference.</p><p> Given the nature of the subject, the research methodology employed is a historical, descriptive, and retrospective study. By utilizing documentary and library sources, this research aims to answer research questions regarding infectious diseases in Ardabil. In this study, information was gathered and indexed based on research objectives using keywords such as &#x0201c;Ardabil, infectious diseases, contagious diseases, quarantine, and Health.&#x0201d; After organizing and analyzing the data, conclusions were drawn.</p><p> Building upon previous research, this study seeks to examine the factors and consequences of infectious disease outbreaks in Ardabil from a historical perspective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="hygienic condition of ardabil during the beginning of the first pahlavi era" id="s2"><title>Hygienic Condition of Ardabil During the Beginning of the First Pahlavi Era</title><p> At the beginning of the first Pahlavi period, the health and treatment situation in Ardabil was poor. Lack of medical and health facilities plagued the people of this region and the death rate from various diseases was terribly high. Diseases such as smallpox, plague, malaria and trachoma killed many people, especially children. For example, in a report from 1925, the head of health department of Ardabil describes the health and treatment situation of this city as &#x0201c;deplorable&#x0201d;. According to him, Ardabil not only lacked proper administrative structures in this field, but it was also deprived of an equipped hospital and aid post.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p> In another report from 1926, it is mentioned that there is a severe shortage of medicine and medical equipment in Ardabil. During this period, Ardabil had only one pharmacy and a basic hospital which was more like a convalescent home. The severe lack of medical equipment and facilities, along with the absence of any health supervision, made the situation worse. Ardabili doctors, despite their efforts, used traditional and old methods to treat patients, and there were no educated doctors in this region.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="outbreak of infectious diseases in ardabil during the first pahlavi era" id="s3"><title>Outbreak of Infectious Diseases in Ardabil During the First Pahlavi Era</title><p> According to the available documents, during the first Pahlavi period, malaria, trachoma, smallpox, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, plague and diphtheria were among the most common diseases in this period.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>

This disease, which is transmitted through direct contact with the infected secretions of an infected person, spreads rapidly in poor sanitary conditions, especially in deprived areas. One of the primitive documentary reports about trachoma in Ardabil is related to the visit of Dr. Mohammad Ghasem Mirdamadi, who was a member of the Institut Pasteur, to the DashBulagh village in 1932. During this travel, while examining villagers, he observed some evidence of this disease and warned against the dangerous consequences of it, especially blindness. The next report about trachoma was presented by Dr. Shams Hakemi, a doctor working in the hospital of this city, in 1935 regarding Ardabil schools.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="smallpox" id="s6"><title>Smallpox</title><p> Smallpox was one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in Ardabil.

In 1927, smallpox outbreaks in Ardabil led to child deaths. In 1937, the prevalence of smallpox in Meshginshahr took the lives of some people. Following this incident, the General Department of Health detached doctors and medicine to these areas to confront this disease.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="venereal diseases" id="s7"><title>Venereal Diseases</title><p> Venereal diseases such as gonorrhea and syphilis were instances of common diseases among people from Ardabil.

This disease killed many people, especially children, and created panic and anxiety among the people. The people of the region, who were upset with the spread of diphtheria and the deaths caused by it, wrote a letter to the State Health Department, requesting for a doctor to be sent to their region.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="tuberculosis" id="s9"><title>Tuberculosis</title><p> Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious respiratory illness characterized by the infection of the lymph nodes and lungs.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> During the late Qajar era (1796-1925) and the early Pahlavi era,<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> TB was particularly prevalent in the northeastern province of Azerbaijan (Ardabil) and along the Caspian Sea coast in northern Iran.<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> This disease was common among carpet weavers in Ardabil.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Unsuitable working conditions, poor ventilation, and inaccessibility of hygienic facilities put the carpet weavers at risk of contracting this disease.

The outbreak of plague in Tazeh Kand and Dashbulagh villages, which claimed all lives of the villagers, was reported to higher authorities. The accuracy of the story was confirmed by an Armenian doctor and Russia&#x02019;s general counsel during their field study visit to Ardabil. The research demonstrated how local authorities&#x02019; incapacity and ignorance prevented them from taking the necessary preventative and curative measures, which accelerated the disease&#x02019;s spread and raised the death toll.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="the flu" id="s11"><title>The Flu</title><p> Influenza was one of the most common diseases in Iran in the late Qajar and early Pahlavi periods.

Lack of access to healthy water caused transmission of infectious diseases.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Reports and correspondences related to public hygiene represented that pollution of passages, drinking water, and subsequent diseases were crucial problems that involved municipalities and other relevant institutions in Ardabil.<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>-<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup></p><p> Economic and social conditions had an important role in the occurrence of these diseases. Many of the people barely observed any individual and environmental hygiene measures due to poverty and inability to afford their substantial needs. On the other hand, changes in social life style, population increase, and migrations of people to cities were the causes that helped outspreading infectious.<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup></p><p> The geographical location of Ardabil especially Astara city was one of the important causes of infectious diseases outbreak.<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Astara as a border city and the main passage of merchants and traders was prone to transmission of infectious diseases.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup></p><p> The relocation of Shahsevan nomads was one of the key factors for threatening public health and hygiene. These relocations provided grounds for transmission of disease from one point to another and spread common diseases between humans and animals. Analyzing the available documents and reports shows the existence of infectious diseases and illnesses like malaria and diarrhea among Shahsevan tribes.<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="government actions in combating infectious diseases in ardabil during the first pahlavi era" id="s13"><title>Government Actions in Combating Infectious Diseases in Ardabil During the First Pahlavi Era</title><p> At the beginning of this era, the fight against diseases started and some actions like completion of rules and regulations, establishment of health centers in towns, serious supervision to prevent outbreak of infectious diseases, establishment of the supreme council of health, cultivating, public and free vaccination, creating and reinforcing quarantine centers, and the establishment of Institut Pasteur took place.<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>-<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> The government tried to prevent outbreak of diseases and, in case of outbreak, to be informed quickly and control them by compilation of rules and regulations.

One of the treatments was at the dispensary clinic. Ardabil and Namin&#x02019;s school students who had malaria were sent to a dispensary clinic to receive treatment. In these centers, doctors and medical staff took necessary actions for students&#x02019; treatment with examination and diagnosis. Another approach to distributing medicine was via the schools principals.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p> The plan of public and free vaccination was approved in the beginning of Pahlavi era. To start the executive process of it, Azerbaijan&#x02019;s state of health demanded the collaboration of Ardabil&#x02019;s people with doctors and vaccinators with regards to the necessity of children&#x02019;s vaccination and its implementing stages.<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> In case of a smallpox outbreak, doctors and vaccinators were assigned and dealt with vaccination in this particular district.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p> One of the important actions of Ardabil dispensary was diagnosis and screening; for example, supervision and inspection of schools and examination of students.<sup><xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> An example would be the visit of Dr. Mirza Asadollahkhan Sehati, who was a circulating doctor in the vicinity of Ardabil, to Astara and Ardabil schools during the outbreak of trachoma in 1935, and examining the students and asking for medicine.<sup><xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup></p><p> Quarantines (temporary and permanent) as one of the key tools of controlling infectious diseases played an important role in preventing the outspread of diseases in Ardabil.<sup><xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> Most quarantines were located in border areas like Astara and Bilehsavar, which were at higher risk of infectious disease outbreaks due to high travel and goods volume.<sup><xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> During outbreaks in Russia and Iran, travelers were required to have a health certificate indicating vaccinations.<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="modification of sanitary and therapeutic structures" id="s15"><title>Modification of Sanitary and Therapeutic Structures</title><p> During the first Pahlavi era, the Ardabil Department of Dispensary took significant actions in order to modify the sanitary system and treatment structure. These modifications were implemented in various fields, such as providing drinkable water, collecting trash, controlling nutrients, fighting against insects and animals carrying diseases, and public education.<sup><xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup> One of the key actions of the dispensary department was the provision of drinkable water to people. The dispensary department brought drinkable water to people by excavating deep holes and constructing piping networks.<sup><xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup></p><p> Public education was one of the main aspects of the dispensary department&#x02019;s programs to improve public health. This department educated people in many different individual and public hygienic fields by publishing health papers and notices, instructing teachers, and giving speeches. One of the important publications that was active in this field was the Jowdat publication. This publication made announcements in the field of hygiene and treatment, in addition to news and local reports.<sup><xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup></p><p> During this period, the dispensary department supervised the hygienic condition of different crafts like bathhouses, inns, tea houses, cookery, and carpet workshops effectively.

Also, Ardabil municipality provided a great help for treating patients by founding a hospital. One of the key actions was creation of permanent circulating first aid stations by Ardabil municipality, which provided free service to patients all over the cities of the province like Khalkhal, Astara, Namin, and Bileh Savar.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s16"><title>Conclusion</title><p> Investigations show that infectious disease outbreaks were common in Ardabil during the first Pahlavi era. Various factors such as deficient public health, inaccessibility of drinkable water, unfavorable economic and social conditions, inefficient government officials, shortage of medical facilities, geographical position of Ardabil, and nomads&#x02019; lifestyle played a role. The first Pahlavi government made efforts to fight against infectious diseases with actions such as educating and informing people, establishing health centers, providing doctors, implementing quarantine, and vaccination. These attempts were successful to some extent and caused a reduction in the outbreak of some diseases. Despite all these, the number of infectious diseases in Ardabil was considerably high. Due to the mentioned points, it can be concluded that infectious diseases were a serious challenge for public health in Ardabil. The first Pahlavi government&#x02019;s actions to fight and control infectious diseases and improve the condition of public health in Ardabil were remarkable.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="n1" fn-type="COI-statement"><p>
