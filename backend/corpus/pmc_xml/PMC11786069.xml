The proton motive force (PMF) represents the electrochemical gradient of protons generated by electron transport and proton pumping across the cytoplasmic membrane, serving as a crucial energy transfer pathway in bacterial membranes. Nevertheless, the impact of PMF on the EET efficiency remains ambiguous, while the microbial rhodopsin offers a simple and efficient avenue for non-photosynthetic cells to harness PMF. Here, we studied the function of three microbial rhodopsins (Arch, Mac, and cR-1) in facilitating EET via their heterologous expression in <italic>S. oneidensis</italic>, a model electroactive microorganism. Among these, the recombinant strain expressing rhodopsin cR-1 exhibited the highest output power density of 0.87&#x000a0;W/m<sup>2</sup>, 3.49-fold increase over the wild-type <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> MR-1. Our further transcriptomics analyses of the energy and materials metabolism of strain cR-1 showed that the underlying mechanism of enhanced EET efficiency was resulted from heterologous expression of the light-driven proton pump. The results suggested that strain cR-1 effectively expels protons to generate additional PMF and provide extra ATP supply to the cells, which facilitated lactate uptake and utilization, thus enhancing electrons generation in cells. This augmented intracellular electron pool capacity ultimately resulted in enhancement of EET rate and power generation efficiency of the recombinant <italic>S. oneidensis</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Extracellular electron transfer</kwd><kwd>Microbial rhodopsin</kwd><kwd>Proton motive force</kwd><kwd><italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> MR-1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Microbial bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) utilize materials metabolism and extracellular electron transfer (EET) process of electroactive microorganisms to convert chemical energy into electrical energy, which enables a diverse array of applications [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>], including microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for bioelectricity production in wastewater treatment [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], microbial electrolysis cells for hydrogen production [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], microbial desalination cells for seawater desalination [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and synthesis of essential chemical compounds via microbial electrosynthesis [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

The electron transfer contributes to the generation of ion gradients (such as proton motive force) across membranes composed of chemical components (&#x00394;[ions]) and electrical components (membrane potential, &#x00394;&#x003c8;), providing energy for various cellular functions [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

Among these strains, the recombinant strain cR-1 that expresses the gene <italic>cop-1</italic> exhibited the highest electricity output power density (0.87&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.030&#x000a0;W/m<sup>2</sup>) in MFC, 3.49-fold higher than that of the strain MY (bearing a blank plasmid). We further investigated the expression of the extrinsic light-driven proton pump on the EET efficiency in the strain cR-1 by examining the proton pumping function, energy metabolism, and carbon source utilization. Firstly, the absorption spectrum of the strain cR-1 was examined, revealing a distinct absorption peak at 566&#x000a0;nm, which provided preliminary evidence of the cR-1 expression. Secondly, the comparison of pH changes between the strains cR-1 and MY under light-dark-light conditions revealed that the strain cR-1 exhibited unidirectional proton extrusion in the presence of light, and experienced a collapse in proton gradient upon addition of the protonophore CCCP, further confirming its function as a proton pump. Finally, the membrane potential detection of the strains cR-1 and MY under light and CCCP addition revealed hyperpolarization caused by proton efflux and depolarization induced by CCCP in the strain cR-1. In conclusion, the enhanced EET efficiency of the strain cR-1 was ascribed to the activation of the light-driven proton pump.</p><p id="p0190">The impact of heterologous proton pump on <italic>Shewanella</italic> metabolism and bioenergetics was further assessed by quantifying the ATP production, lactate metabolism, and NAD(H/<sup>+</sup>) generation, which facilitated the elucidation of the intricate mechanism underlying the enhanced EET efficiency facilitated by the heterologous light-driven proton pumps. The intracellular ATP level detection results of the strains MY and cR-1 indicated that the elevated ATP level in the strain cR-1 was attributed to the proton pump-generated PMF. Moreover, the gene expression level of ATP synthase subunit (<italic>atpA-I</italic>) in the strain cR-1 exhibited a significantly higher level compared to that in the strain MY, providing further evidence to substantiate this conclusion. The cR-1 strain exhibited a significant increase in lactate consumption and acetate production compared to the strain MY. The expression levels of the key enzyme genes involved in lactate metabolism were markedly upregulated in the strain cR-1, suggesting that PMF generated by light-driven proton pumping leads to enhanced lactate consumption, resulting in an increased availability of electrons that flow through the EET pathway. The levels of NADH, NAD<sup>+</sup> and total NAD(H/<sup>+</sup>) in the strain cR-1 were found to be significantly higher than those in the strain MY. Moreover, a majority of the genes encoding the proton-pumping NADH dehydrogenase Nuo exhibited notable upregulation. These findings indicate that the augmentation of the intracellular electron pool by the proton pump leads to enhanced electron transfer from lactate to the EET pathway, thereby amplifying intracellular electron efflux and EET rate.</p><p id="p0195">The prevailing mode of bacterial membrane-dependent energy metabolism is based on the transmembrane circulation of protons. The primary proton pump actively expels H<sup>+</sup> ions from cytoplasm, generating PMF, which serves as the direct driving force for many essential cellular functions. The EET efficiency was significantly enhanced by heterogeneous expression of light-driven proton pumps, which effectively resolved the predicament of inadequate PMF supply in the course of electron transfer, highlighting that sufficient energy provision is critical in enhancing the EET rate. In addition to enhancing the EET efficiency, the light-driven proton gradient could also be harnessed for driving high-energy synthesis reactions in fine chemicals production, thereby establishing a robust foundation for further advancement in rational engineering of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> for BESs applications.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0200"><bold>Wenqi Ding:</bold> Writing &#x02013; original draft, Visualization, Validation, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization. <bold>Tong Lin:</bold> Writing &#x02013; original draft, Visualization, Validation, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization. <bold>Yun Yang:</bold> Validation, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Conceptualization. <bold>Wen-Wei Li:</bold> Validation, Supervision, Project administration, Conceptualization. <bold>Shaoan Cheng:</bold> Validation, Supervision, Project administration, Conceptualization. <bold>Hao Song:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Supervision, Resources, Project administration, Methodology, Funding acquisition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="coi0010"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0205">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Logan</surname><given-names>B.E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rabaey</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Conversion of wastes into bioelectricity and chemicals by using microbial electrochemical technologies</article-title><source>Science</source><volume>337</volume><issue>6095</issue><year>2012</year><fpage>686</fpage><lpage>690</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1126/science.1217412</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22879507</pub-id>
