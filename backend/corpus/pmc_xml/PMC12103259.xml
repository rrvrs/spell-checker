Annual global estimates suggest between 291,243 and 645,832 respiratory deaths due to seasonal influenza, translating to 4.0 to 8.8 deaths per 100,000 individuals [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the United States, the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) reported between 114,192 and 624,435 hospitalizations and up to 27,174 deaths per year between 2010 and 2013 [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These data emphasize the significant burden that influenza imposes on healthcare systems.</p><p>One serious complication of influenza is bacterial coinfection, which can significantly worsen outcomes. During the 2009 influenza pandemic, 30-33% of critically ill patients had a secondary bacterial infection. The most frequently implicated organisms include <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>species, and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although coinfections are more common in immunocompromised or chronically ill patients [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], they may also arise in previously healthy individuals.</p><p>When pleural infections become loculated or resistant to standard chest tube drainage, intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy may be used. This treatment involves injecting agents such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and DNase into the pleural space to help break down fibrinous septations and facilitate drainage. Although generally effective, this therapy carries a small risk of complications. There are infrequent reports of hemorrhagic pleural effusion following intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; however, to our knowledge, hemorrhagic pericardial effusion has not been previously described.</p><p>We describe the case of a previously healthy young man with influenza and<italic> Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> coinfection who developed a rapidly accumulating, hemorrhagic pericardial effusion following intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy. To our knowledge, this appears to be the first reported case of such a complication occurring in this clinical context. This case highlights a rare but clinically important complication and underscores the need for careful monitoring and consideration of anatomic proximity when managing complex pleural infections with fibrinolytics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 34-year-old male originally from South America presented to the emergency department (ED) with worsening fever, chills, headache, cough, shortness of breath (SOB), and pleuritic chest pain. Two days earlier, he had visited another ED and tested positive for influenza type B. He was discharged with a five-day course of oseltamivir. Due to symptom progression, he returned for re-evaluation.</p><p>On presentation (day 1 of hospitalization), he was noted to have tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, and leukocytosis with a left shift. A repeat influenza test remained positive. Chest X-ray demonstrated a large left pleural effusion, and a 12-lead ECG showed generalized ST elevation, initially interpreted as early repolarization (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Chest CT revealed a large, lobulated, and loculated left pleural effusion with associated left lung atelectasis (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Notably, the effusion was in direct anatomical proximity to the pericardium.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Initial 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) on day 1 showing generalized ST-segment elevations. These changes were initially interpreted as early repolarization. In retrospect, they may represent early signs of pericardial involvement, preceding the later development of pericardial effusion.

At this time, no pericardial effusion was observed.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000084757-i02" position="float"/></fig><p>Blood cultures were obtained, and a left-sided chest tube was placed under ultrasound guidance. Pleural fluid was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. The patient was admitted to the medical floor.</p><p>On day 2, he developed progressive drowsiness, increased oxygen requirement necessitating high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and worsening tachycardia. Both blood and pleural fluid cultures were positive for <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (Group A). Infectious Disease and Critical Care teams were consulted, and he was upgraded to a telemetry-capable unit. Antibiotics were escalated to ceftriaxone 2 g every 12 hours and clindamycin for toxin inhibition. Oseltamivir was continued, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered for three days.</p><p>On day 5 of admission, due to persistent loculated empyema, intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy with tPA and dornase alfa was initiated, administered twice daily for three days (total of six doses). A transthoracic echocardiogram performed earlier that day showed no pericardial effusion, providing a useful baseline.</p><p>On day 10, the patient remained afebrile but continued to require supplemental oxygen at 2-3 liters per minute via nasal cannula. He had persistent mild tachycardia and shortness of breath with minimal physical activity. A repeat chest CT demonstrated persistent but smaller loculated pleural effusions adjacent to extensive left lower lobe consolidation, as well as a newly developed large pericardial effusion (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Repeat chest CT on day 10 showing a newly developed, large pericardial effusion.

Intraoperative findings included dense pleural adhesions, multiloculated pleural and pericardial effusions, thickened pericardium, and multiple lung abscesses.</p><p>Cultures from pericardial and pleural fluid and tissue samples were negative except for one pleural tissue culture that grew Staphylococcus warneri, considered a contaminant in the absence of supporting clinical or microbiologic evidence. No additional antibiotics were added.</p><p>Postoperatively, the patient showed rapid clinical improvement. His leukocytosis, fever, and tachycardia resolved, and he no longer required supplemental oxygen. He was discharged on amoxicillin-clavulanate 875-125 mg twice daily for four weeks.</p><p>Follow-up with Pulmonology and Cardiology was arranged. Given the delayed onset of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion in this case, clinicians should be alert to new or unexplained chest symptoms, worsening anemia, or persistent tachycardia in the days following intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy, particularly when imaging shows anatomical proximity between the pleural effusion and pericardium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Influenza complicated by bacterial coinfection is more frequently observed in individuals with comorbidities such as advanced age, young children, pregnancy, severe obesity, and chronic underlying medical conditions affecting the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, nervous system, or immune system [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, our patient was a previously healthy young adult without known risk factors. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>species, and, less commonly, <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (Group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, GAS) were identified as frequent contributors to bacterial coinfection [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this case, both blood and pleural fluid cultures were positive for GAS.</p><p>The patient was treated with ceftriaxone, clindamycin, oseltamivir, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), with clinical improvement. This approach aligns with prior evidence demonstrating reduced mortality in invasive GAS infections treated with clindamycin and IVIG [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Management of complicated parapneumonic effusions typically begins with tube thoracostomy, and if drainage is inadequate, intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator and dornase alfa) is often indicated to promote resolution [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In our case, chest CTs obtained on hospital day 1 and day 3 demonstrated no evidence of pericardial effusion. On day 5, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed immediately prior to initiating fibrinolytic therapy, and the absence of pericardial fluid was also confirmed (Figure <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, by day 10, a repeat chest CT revealed a new, large pericardial effusion (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), prompting surgical drainage.

These changes correlate temporally with the completion of intrapleural fibrinolytics and the emergence of a hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, raising concern for a possible association.</p><p>Although hemorrhagic pleural complications following intrapleural fibrinolytics have been reported [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the development of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion in this context is exceedingly rare. A targeted search of PubMed and Google Scholar using the terms &#x0201c;intrapleural fibrinolytic&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;pericardial effusion&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;bloody pericardial effusion&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;fibrinolytic complication&#x0201d; yielded no prior reported cases. However, rare complications may be underreported or absent from the indexed literature.</p><p>Several plausible mechanisms could explain this complication. One hypothesis is that the fibrinolytic agents may have contributed to local hemorrhage through inflammation-induced vascular permeability, particularly given the close anatomical proximity of the pleural effusion to the pericardium (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Alternatively, microperforation or diffusion across inflamed pleuropericardial surfaces could have allowed fluid or agents to track into the pericardial space. Although a direct causal link cannot be definitively confirmed, the temporal association, anatomical context, and a notable hemoglobin drop raise concern for a potential connection.</p><p>Infectious pericarditis was also considered. Pericardial cultures were negative after five days; however, the patient was on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which likely reduced the sensitivity of culture-based diagnostics. While PCR or cytology may offer improved diagnostic yield, they were not performed in this case due to rapid clinical recovery following surgical intervention. The absence of fever, resolving leukocytosis, and improving oxygenation at the time of effusion development made active infection less likely.</p><p>The patient&#x02019;s initial 12-lead ECG on day 1 showed generalized ST elevation, initially interpreted as early repolarization. In retrospect, these changes could reflect early pericardial involvement, and we have now included this possibility in the differential diagnosis. Clinicians should be cautious in interpreting such findings in the presence of adjacent thoracic infections or evolving clinical symptoms.</p><p>This case highlights a potential but unrecognized complication of intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy in patients with anatomically complex infections. While this therapy remains a cornerstone of empyema management, clinicians should consider baseline and follow-up echocardiography, especially when the pleural effusion abuts the pericardium on imaging. In patients with persistent dyspnea, hemodynamic changes, or new ECG abnormalities, a low threshold for repeat imaging may aid in identifying evolving pericardial complications early.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy remains a standard and effective approach for managing persistent, loculated pleural effusions. In this case, the patient developed a hemopericardium - a rare and potentially life-threatening complication. Although a definitive causal relationship cannot be established, the temporal association, presence of bloody pericardial fluid, and anatomical proximity of the pleural effusion to the pericardium (as demonstrated on imaging) raise clinical concern.</p><p>This case underscores the importance of careful imaging review and consideration of baseline and follow-up echocardiographic monitoring in select patients receiving fibrinolytics, particularly when anatomical relationships may increase risk. In patients whose pleural effusions are in direct contact with the pericardium, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for pericardial involvement, including early signs of pericarditis on ECG or physical exam. If the patient exhibits signs or symptoms of pericarditis from the outset, or if symptoms persist or clinical improvement is less than expected, there should be a low threshold for follow-up imaging to evaluate for newly developed pericardial effusion.</p><p>While infection remains a possible etiology, especially in the setting of ongoing antibiotic treatment and negative cultures, the sequence of events in this case suggests a potential association with fibrinolytic therapy. Further investigation and case accumulation are needed to clarify the incidence, mechanisms, and risk factors for this complication.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Pooriya Bahadoran, Redi Nikollari, Lisa N.
