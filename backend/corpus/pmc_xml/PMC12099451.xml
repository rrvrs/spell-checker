Hormones delay senescence by regulating fruit physiology and metabolism, but their specific effects and mechanisms must be further investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>To extend the postharvest storage duration of kiwifruit, we conducted a study using 'Yan Nong 3' kiwifruit as our test material. The fruits were treated with varying concentrations of Brassinolide (BRs), melatonin (MT), methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salicylic acid (SA), respectively. Subsequently, on the basis of a one-way test, an orthogonal experiment was designed with fruit hardness as an indicator (7 days of storage at room temperature) to obtain the optimal process formulation for phytohormone synergistic treatment (PEHC): 10 &#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> for BRs, 200 &#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> for MT, 300 &#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> for MeJA, and 2 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> for SA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results showed that after 60 days of storage at 4&#x000b0;C, PEHC was found to increase the good fruit rate and the hardness of kiwifruit by 5.97% and 67.42%, respectively, compared to the control. PEHC reduced weight loss rate and disease index, slowed the decrease in titratable acid content (TAC) and vitamin C (VC) content, maintained color, and delayed the accumulation of SSC. At 80 days of storage, the hardness, good fruit rate, VC content, and TAC of PEHC increased by 68.38%, 28.87%, 32.76 mg&#x000b7;100 g<sup>-1</sup>, and 20.00%, respectively, compared to the control. Whereas, the difference in SSC of PEHC compared to control was nosignificant. The PEHC reduced the content of 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC). Transcriptomics revealed that PEHC inhibited the gene expression levels of <italic>Acc08469</italic> in s-adenosylmethionine synthetase (MetK), as well as <italic>Acc20538, Acc24995</italic>, and <italic>Acc17490</italic> in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase. Using metabolomics, PEHC increased the relative contents of acids and amino acids and decreased the relative contents of aroma, pigments or phenolics, and soluble sugars compared with the control, of which the trends of changes in acids and soluble sugars were consistently associated with the changes in fruit quality.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The PEHC had a favorable effect on maintaining kiwifruit quality and delayed the decline in postharvest storage quality.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>kiwifruit</kwd><kwd>hormones</kwd><kwd>hardness</kwd><kwd>quality</kwd><kwd>orthogonal experiment</kwd><kwd>metabolomic</kwd><kwd>transcriptomic</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

In 2022, the total kiwifruit production in China was 2.38 million tons, accounting for 52.4% of the global total and ranking first in the world (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). Kiwifruit is popular among the public and has high nutritional and economic value due to its high content of minerals, vitamins C and E, dietary fiber, and amino acids (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Satpal et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). In recent years, the kiwifruit industry in China has been developing rapidly and has become a pillar industry for agricultural development and rural revitalization, playing an important role in promoting farmers&#x02019; income, accelerating the structural adjustment of the fruit industry, and alleviating poverty. Kiwifruit is a typical climacteric and ethylene-sensitive fruit; it is prone to softening, dehydration-induced shrinkage, and quality loss under room-temperature storage, eventually leading to fruit rot and spoilage (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Gwanpua et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Kiwifruit faces problems, including a more concentrated time to market, bad fruit in storage, and a short shelf-life after leaving the warehouse, making it particularly important to improve post-harvest fruit storage technology.</p><p>Currently, the primary preservation techniques employed for kiwifruit include low-temperature refrigeration, air-conditioned physical storage, packaging storage, and pharmaceutical preservation methods (such as vitamin C, Chitosan, and 1-methylcyclopopene, etc). Notably, research on plant hormone preservation has emerged as a popular research topic in recent years, due to its pollution-free nature and the difficulty in developing resistance to it. Among them, the preservation effect of synergistic treatment with compound hormones was better than that after single hormone treatment. <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Yin et&#x000a0;al. (2013)</xref> demonstrated that SA and its derivative, acetylsalicylic acid, are crucial plant hormones capable of regulating the expression of genes related to ethylene synthesis and signaling. By inhibiting ethylene synthesis, these hormones can effectively delay the ripening process of the fruit. Hu M and Luo et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Hu, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lou et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>) discovered that the application of exogenous melatonin (MT) during kiwifruit storage can effectively slow down the increase in fruit hardness, TAC, and SSC, while also inhibiting the decline in respiration rate. This, in turn, maintains the fruit&#x02019;s storage quality and significantly extends its shelf life. Lai and Pan et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Pan et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>) further demonstrated that the use of MeJA can effectively inhibit the postharvest decline in kiwifruit hardness, VC content, SSC, and soluble sugar content. Additionally, it exhibits a notable preventive and curative effect in reducing the incidence of fruit diseases.</p><p>
<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Niu et&#x000a0;al. (2023)</xref> found that MeJA combined with SA treatment effectively inhibited the reduction of fruit firmness, delayed the increase of decay rate and disease index, and reduced the accumulation of soluble solids compared with single hormone treatment. Yu et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Yu and Xie, 2019</xref>) concluded that combining multiple preservation methods not only outperformed pure preservation techniques in terms of effectiveness but also complemented each other&#x02019;s deficiencies, thereby maximizing the retention of nutrients within the fruit. Despite this, research on the synergistic effects of the hormones BRs, MT, MeJA, and SA on the storage quality of postharvest kiwifruit remains scarce. Transcriptomics is a discipline that studies the transcription and transcriptional regulation of genes in cells at the global level. Metabolomics is a discipline that studies the collection of all metabolites within a cell at a given moment. In this study, &#x02018;Yan Nong 3&#x02019; kiwifruit was selected as the test material. The fruit is elliptical, with brown skin and short fuzz. The flesh is dark green. Through a series of one-way and orthogonal tests, an optimized hormone compound formulation was developed. Conduct relevant quality research on this optimized hormone compound formulation, and combine transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis to investigate the differences in metabolite composition and content in kiwifruit, as well as the expression levels of related genes. The impact of these optimal hormone combinations on the quality of post-harvest kiwifruit was then investigated, aiming to provide a scientific basis for the regulation of postharvest storage quality in kiwifruit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Test material</title><p>Kiwifruits of the &#x0201c;Yan Nong 3&#x0201d; variety were harvested from Hunan Tao Yuan Ming Fruit Biological Company, located in Taoyuan County, Hunan Province.

The experiment was divided into three groups, Group A was kiwifruit stored at 4&#x000b0;C on the 2nd day. Group B was the fruit at 4&#x000b0;C on the 30th day after PEHC treatment (at this time, the control group began to show signs of spoilage). Group C was control fruits stored at 4&#x000b0;C on the 30th day. After sampling the fruits of groups A, B, and C, they were quickly put into liquid nitrogen for quick freezing. Each group consists of 3 replicates, for a total of 9 samples. Samples were used for metabolite and total RNA extraction separately.</p><p>Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Plant RNA Purification Reagent for plant tissue). RNA degradation and contamination were assessed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. After quality testing, the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used for library construction, following the main steps outlined in the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction manual. The constructed library was sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (2 &#x000d7; 150 bp read length). The sequencing process was performed by Shanghai Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd.

The clean reads of each sample were aligned to the reference transcript sequence using RSEM software. The number of reads mapped to each gene was then quantified for each sample. The expression level of each gene was calculated according to the transcripts per million reads (TPM) method. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted using the DESeq software, with screening criteria set at P-adjust &#x02264; 0.05 and |log<sub>2</sub>FC (fold change)| &#x02265; 1 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Choi et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>).

The sequencing analysis was conducted by Shanghai Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). For metabolite extraction, 50 mg of the solid sample was transferred into a 2 mL centrifuge tube containing a 6 mm grinding bead. Subsequently, 400 &#x003bc;L of extraction solution (methanol: water = 4:1, v/v), containing 0.02 mg/mL of internal standard (L-2-chlorophenylalanine), was added to the tube to facilitate metabolite extraction. The sample was ground using a Wonbio-96c (Shanghai Wanbai Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) frozen tissue grinder for 6 mins (-10&#x000b0;C, 50 Hz), followed by low-temperature ultrasonic extraction for 30 mins (5&#x000b0;C, 40 kHz). Place the sample at -20&#x000b0;C for 30 mins, centrifuge for 15 mins (4&#x000b0;C, 13,000 g), and transfer the supernatant to an injection bottle for LC-MS/MS analysis. The mass spectrometry data obtained were processed using the software Progenesis QI (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA), including chromatographic peak integration and correction. Substance identification was performed based on secondary mass spectrometry (MS/MS) information using public databases (HMDB and Metlin) and Majorbio&#x02019;s in-house database. Quantitative analysis was conducted using the Majorbio Cloud platform (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.majorbio.com/" ext-link-type="uri">cloud.majorbio.com</ext-link>). For statistical analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were carried out using the ropls package (Version 1.6.2) in R language. Differential metabolites were screened based on a variable importance in projection (VIP) score of &#x02265; 1 and a significance threshold of P&#x0003c; 0.05 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Wu et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>).

Under 30 days of storage, PEHC increased the relative contents of acids and amino acids and decreased the relative contents of odors, pigments, and soluble sugars compared with the control group, of which the trends of changes in acids and soluble sugars were consistently associated with the changes in fruit quality. It showed that PEHC could improve the fruit storage quality, thus delaying the aging and softening of the fruit, and thus achieving the purpose of preservation. Some studies have shown that phytohormones can effectively inhibit ethylene biosynthesis in fruits, which is an important means of maintaining fruit quality and prolonging the storage period. For example, BRs (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>), MT (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Zhai et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>), MeJA (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wu et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), and SA (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Yin et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>), and their mechanisms mainly focus on the inhibition of gene expression and enzyme activity. It has been demonstrated that hormone treatments inhibit the expression of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis, such as <italic>ACS1</italic>, <italic>PcACO</italic>, <italic>MaACO1</italic>, and <italic>ACO1</italic>, and reduce ethylene production (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). The expression of the <italic>Acc08469</italic> gene in metK and <italic>Acc20538</italic>, <italic>Acc24995</italic>, and <italic>Acc17490</italic> genes in ACO was down-regulated by PEHC treatment as found by transcriptomics, and the ACC content was measured by targeted metabolism-phytohormone and was found to be lower in PEHC treatment as compared to control. ACS is a rate-limiting enzyme that has an important effect on ACC synthesis, and the decrease in ACC content in PEHC treatment in this study may be related to the down-regulation of <italic>Acc20538</italic>, <italic>Acc24995</italic>, and <italic>Acc17490</italic> gene expression. Moreover, during the conversion of methionine to SAM by metK, the down-regulation of <italic>Acc08469</italic> gene expression of metK may affect the synthesis of SAM, which in turn affects the synthesis of ACC. ACC synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO) are the two main enzymes for ethylene synthesis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Khan et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). In this paper, in conjunction with the results of PEHC treatment to obtain the storage quality of kiwifruit, we hypothesized that PEHC treatment could inhibit ethylene production in kiwifruit fruits and that the <italic>Acc20538</italic>, <italic>Acc24995</italic>, and <italic>Acc17490</italic> genes in ACO were likely to be the key genes for ethylene reduction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, PEHC can inhibit the expression levels of key genes in the ethylene synthesis pathway, indirectly reducing the ethylene content in kiwifruit, thus greatly improving the storage capacity and quality maintenance of kiwifruit. In particular, the PEHC down-regulated <italic>Acc08469</italic> gene expression in metK and <italic>Acc20538</italic>, <italic>Acc24995</italic>, and <italic>Acc17490</italic> gene expression in ACO and reduced ACC content. Notably, the PEHC reduced the weight loss rate and disease index of kiwifruit, increased hardness, good fruit rate, TAC and VC content, maintained fruit color, and delayed the accumulation of SSC. Furthermore, PEHC altered the relative levels of metabolites(DAMs) in kiwifruit, specifically increasing acids and amino acids while decreasing the relative levels of aroma, pigments or phenolics, and soluble sugars. Therefore, PEHC has great potential for the development as a green preservative for kiwifruit and even for other horticultural crops.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The author would like to thank all colleagues who have worked in this research and related fields.
