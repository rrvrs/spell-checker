in a controlled
manner remains a challenging topic in materials science, especially
when trying to assess the following changes in mechanical material
properties in real time. To address these challenges, we here utilize
a custom-made measurement setup that allows us to manipulate the cross-linking
state of alginate-based hydrogels <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> while quantifying
the achieved alterations in the viscoelastic response of the biopolymer
networks. Interpolymer connections in the biopolymer networks are
created by a combination of light-induced, covalent cross-links, ionic
cross-links, and DNA-based cross-links, where the latter two can be
successfully removed again by employing either chelating agents (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and
citrate) or suitable displacement DNA strands. In part, this range
of the different cross-linking options mentioned is <italic toggle="yes">inter
alia</italic> made possible by incorporating the glycoprotein mucin
into the alginate system, which also allows for a range of different
starting (&#x0223c;0.2&#x02013;400 Pa), intermediate (&#x0223c;25 Pa&#x02013;1.6
kPa), and final stiffnesses (&#x0223c;4 Pa&#x02013;1.2 kPa) of the mixed
hydrogel matrix. At the same time, the presence of mucins (1&#x02013;4%
(w/v)) in the biopolymer mixture enhances the properties of the cytocompatible
hydrogel by improving its antibacterial characteristics. Such well-controllable
alginate/mucin networks with dynamically switchable mechanical properties
will likely find broad applications in cell cultivation studies or
tissue engineering applications.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><graphic xlink:href="am5c03419_0011.jpg" position="float"/></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc-graphic"><graphic xlink:href="am5c03419_0009.jpg" id="tgr1" position="float"/></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>reversible cross-links</kwd><kwd>biopolymer</kwd><kwd>tunable

polymer networks containing
large amounts of water or physiological fluid, is typically quite

range of characteristics.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> In part, this is due
to the large variety of polymers available to create hydrogel systems,
and those can either be synthetic or of natural origin. Applications
of such hydrogels range from drug delivery over tissue engineering
to wound dressings.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> To meet the specific requirements
of a biomedical application (such as biocompatibility, degradability,
or dedicated mechanical properties), many different base materials
and combinations created thereof have been explored.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"/> For biomedical implementations, a range of different biopolymers
is available to create hydrogels (see Supporting Information, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03419/suppl_file/am5c03419_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Section S1</ext-link>), and such biopolymers appear to be
especially advantageous due to their inherently great biocompatibility,
their ability to interact with other biomolecules, and their (often)
high similarity to components of the extracellular matrix.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"/> However, tailoring the mechanical properties
of hydrogels remains a challenge, as most biopolymer-based materials
stabilized by physical entanglements alone tend to be rather soft.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"/> Accordingly, cross-linking (based on physical
or chemical approaches) is typically employed to create biopolymer-based
hydrogels with different stiffnesses,<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> and ionic as
well as covalent cross-links are the most frequently used examples.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02212;<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" specific-use="suppress-in-print"/>
<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content>
</p><p>For certain biological applications where dynamic properties
are
required, however, being able to create a homogeneously cross-linked
system with well-defined but permanent mechanical properties is unsatisfactory
as hydrogels with switchable properties are required.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"/> In such cases, adjusting the concentration or molecular
weight of the biopolymer component or the cross-linking agent prior
to hydrogel preparation<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02212;<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" specific-use="suppress-in-print"/>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" specific-use="suppress-in-print"/>
<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> is not sufficient. To create a system with dynamically
changeable mechanical properties, Rijns et al.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"/> developed a benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide based material
into which they incorporated a poly&#x000ad;(<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-isopropylacrylamide)-functionalized
component to enable temperature induced changes in stiffness. Here,
the system exhibits a strong increase in stiffness at around 20 &#x000b0;C;
however, this critical temperature is not really suitable for biomedical
applications, where cells are incorporated into the material, which
requires the temperature to be maintained at physiological levels.
Li et al.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"/> embedded magnetic microparticles
into polyacrylamide hydrogels to achieve a magnetically adjustable
surface stiffness that influences cellular behavior. Also, this approach
is only useful for selected applications as a strong magnet needs
to be brought into close contact with the material&#x0e5f8;and this
is not always feasible. Other approaches make use of changes in sample
pH,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"/> DNA-based cross-linking,<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> or induce covalent cross-links based on photoreactions<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> to trigger changes in the hydrogel stiffness.</p><p>In other approaches,
several cross-linking mechanisms were combined
to increase the options of how to change the hydrogel stiffness. For
instance, Bian et al.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"/> changed the mechanical
properties of a calmodulin-based hydrogel in two steps: first, by
cross-linking with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which then further interacted
with trifluoperazine to generate a secondary cross-linking effect.
Similarly, Li et al.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"/> combined enzymatic
with light-induced cross-linking strategies in gelatin hydrogels,
and sequential stiffness changes in alginate hydrogels were achieved
by combining ionic and covalent cross-linking strategies (the latter
of which made use of illumination with green light<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"/> or UV light<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"/>). In addition,
Moheimani et al.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"/> suggested repeated autoclaving
of alginate hydrogels to sequentially change the viscoelastic properties
of the material. Alginate-based hydrogels provide several advantages
compared to other biopolymer gels, and examples include the absence
of a strong temperature dependency (which is a typical feature of, <italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., gelatin gels<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr"/> and can introduce undesired handling issues), good solubility in
water (which is in contrast to, <italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., cellulose and its derivates<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content>), and their low cost
(see Supporting Information, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03419/suppl_file/am5c03419_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Section S1 and Table S1</ext-link>).</p><p>Using pure alginate hydrogels, however, comes with
some disadvantages
such as problems with their long-term mechanical stability (especially
when relying on ionic cross-links only<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr"/>), insufficient controllability of degradation (when using alginate
of high molecular weight<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr"/> and/or ionic
cross-links<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr"/>), or the lack of naturally
occurring cellular binding sites.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> To mitigate
these issues, incorporating another biopolymer component could be
a good strategy, thus creating a composite material with a broader
range of properties. For such a purpose, biopolymers like gelatin,
cellulose, or fibronectin can be useful candidates. For instance,
Tansik and Stowers<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr"/> sequentially cross-linked
a composite hydrogel comprising alginate and methacrylated gelatin,
and Lee et al.<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr"/> employed two different
ions, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>, to create a sequential
increase in stiffness in alginate/carboxymethyl cellulose beads. Moreover,
Trujillo et al.<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr"/> created alginate/fibronectin
hybrid hydrogels stabilized by a combination of ionic and covalent
cross-links. There, permanent, covalent cross-links were created by
illumination with UV light, whereas the ionic cross-links were dynamically
switched off and on by employing a chelating agent. In detail, the
cross-links were removed by washing out the ionic cross-linkers (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., by macroscopic immersion of the samples
in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) solutions<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr"/>). In a recent approach
by Scott et al.,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr"/> the diffusion of poly&#x000ad;(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) into and out of an alginate-based material resulted
in reversible changes in stiffness over the course of several days.
By adapting the PEG concentration in the incubation medium, a dynamically
switchable process was obtained. Even though switchable mechanical
properties were demonstrated in these studies, they relied on very
long incubation times (several hours to days) as well as end point
measurements and thus could not report the kinetics of the switching
processes. However, such information would be highly desirable to
better understand the applicability of the different strategies in
such settings, where the time window for hydrogel manipulation is
limited.</p><p>Here, we address this issue by following the dynamic
alteration
of the viscoelastic hydrogel properties <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., we follow the kinetics of processes
that establish or remove cross-links in biopolymer networks. Moreover,
we present a novel composite hydrogel system, in which we integrate
mucin glycoproteins as a biologically active component into alginate
hydrogels. With this additional biopolymer component, we leverage
the intrinsic advantages of mucins, <italic toggle="yes">inter alia</italic> the
presence of additional chemical moieties for attaching cross-linking
motifs<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr"/> and its antibacterial properties.<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr"/> For such mucin/alginate hybrid networks, we
assess the suitability of different binary combinations of covalent,
ionic, and DNA-based cross-linking strategies and assess their reversibility.
In addition, we investigate the biocompatibility of the components
used to generate the different cross-linked systems and demonstrate
the antibacterial effect brought about by the mucins toward several
bacterial strains.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>We here aim at creating a mixed
network of interpenetrating biopolymers
(<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., alginate and mucin) that
is stabilized by a combination of different cross-links; those cross-links
should be activatable or inactivatable on demand. The range of cross-links
explored here is summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>. It comprises ionic cross-links, covalent cross-links
(that can be generated between methacrylated macromolecules upon light
exposure in the presence of a photoinitiator), and transient cross-links
established by partially self-complementary DNA strands that are conjugated
to the biopolymers. Whereas the ionic and DNA-based cross-links should
be (partially) removable by adding a chelator and a displacement DNA
strand, respectively, the covalent cross-links will&#x0e5f8;of course&#x0e5f8;be
permanent once they have been created.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1" fig-type="figure"><label>1</label><caption><p>Schematic visualization
of different options to create activatable/inactivatable
cross-links between biopolymers. These comprise (a) ionic cross-linking,
which should be reversable by adding a chelator; (b) nonreversible,
covalent cross-linking of methacrylated biopolymers; (c) DNA assisted
cross-linking, which should be reversable by adding a suitable displacement
DNA strand. The schematic drawings were made using BioRender: <uri xlink:href="https://BioRender.com/o69y852">https://BioRender.com/o69y852</uri>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="am5c03419_0001" id="gr1" position="float"/></fig><p>To be able to manipulate cross-links in a biopolymer
hydrogel sample <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic>, we make use of a dedicated
measuring setup, which
was previously developed in our lab.<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr"/> With
this setup, it is possible to add reactants to a sample during the
measurement by allowing for a diffusive exchange of small molecules
between the sample and a reservoir located below. This enables us
to follow the dynamic alteration of material properties in response
to such a manipulation. The diffuse entry of reactants into the sample
occurs through a macroporous bottom plate that is covered with a microporous
membrane (see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref> for details).
In addition, to allow for an <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> formation of
covalent cross-links between distinct biopolymers, this setup is further
modified by replacing the (nontransparent) standard measuring geometry
provided by the device manufacturer with an in-house crafted version
that is transparent toward UV light (see Supporting Information, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03419/suppl_file/am5c03419_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Section S2</ext-link>). With this modification, it is possible
to illuminate a sample either from above (which enables the simultaneous
use of the porous bottom plate) or from below (by employing a transparent
bottom plate that is commercially available from Anton Paar). And
indeed, when inducing the UV-triggered cross-linking of methacrylated
alginate (mAlg) or methacrylated mucin (mMUC) samples in the presence
of a suitable photoinitiator, we obtain very similar gelation kinetics
as well as final gel stiffnesses with either illumination method (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>a): In the case of
4% (w/v) mAlg, illumination from below results in a gel stiffness
around 600 Pa, whereas illumination from above yields a gel with a
stiffness of &#x0223c;300 Pa. For 2% (w/v) mMUC, positioning the UV
light below the sample induces a gel stiffness of around 30 and &#x0223c;20
Pa is achieved via illumination from above.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2" fig-type="figure"><label>2</label><caption><p>Viscoelastic properties

strategy employing a green light source (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>b).</p><p>Again, mMUC and mAlg samples were
cross-linked in the presence
of a suitable cross-linking agent by illumination from above or from
below. Here, exposure of an mAlg solution to green light induces gelation
with kinetics similar to what we obtained for UV-based cross-linking,
and the generated gels have stiffness values around 6 kPa for illumination
from below and &#x0223c;3.5 kPa for illumination from above. For mMUC
solutions, the created gels have stiffnesses around 30 Pa for either
illumination direction. In other words, also when employing green
light, both strategies of exposing the material to light to induce
cross-linking are similarly successful. In this case, whereas the
stiffness values obtained for cross-linked mMUC gels are in a similar
range for both types of light sources, cross-linking mAlg by employing
green light results in higher stiffnesses compared to when UV light
is used. However, when conducting this direct comparison, it is important
to note that the two light sources have different intensities, and
the employed cross-linking agents differ in efficiency and (thus)
concentration.</p><p>In addition to employing light-induced cross-linking,
our setup
also allows samples to be ionically cross-linked <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> by filling the reservoir located in the bottom of the &#x0201c;hole-y
plate&#x0201d; with, <italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., a calcium
chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) solution: then, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions
can diffuse through the membrane and enter the biopolymer solution.
In the case of alginate samples, when using a CaCl<sub>2</sub> concentration
of 0.1 M in the reservoir, this process results in the formation of
a viscoelastic gel with a final stiffness of around 6 kPa (see Supporting
Information, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03419/suppl_file/am5c03419_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Section S3 and Figure S2a</ext-link>),
which indicates efficient ionic cross-linking of the alginate chains
by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. For this particular ion/biopolymer combination,
this result was expected and is typically described by the so-called
&#x0201c;egg-box&#x0201d; model. However, for our porcine gastric mucin
samples, a CaCl<sub>2</sub> concentration of 50 mM (this concentration
was reported to be optimal for the ionic cross-linking of bovine submaxillary
mucins) has only a weak effect (see Supporting Information, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03419/suppl_file/am5c03419_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Section S4</ext-link>) and creates a state that is just
at the threshold toward a viscoelastic solid (= a gel).</p><p>In contrast
to the covalent cross-linking strategy described above,
ionic cross-linking comes with the advantage that it can, in principle,
be reversed. This can either be achieved by diluting the ions by sample
washing<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr"/> (which requires very long incubation
times in a washing buffer of up to 24 h) or by adding a chelating
agent that sequesters the ions and thus removes a previously formed
cross-link.<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr"/> Here, we attempt to reverse
the ionic cross-linking <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> by adding a chelator
to the reservoir via the pumping system. Then, as the chelating agent
diffuses through the membrane into the sample, it can gradually bind
Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions which results in a reduction of the viscoelastic
moduli over time. However, when using only one chelating agent (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., either EDTA or citrate), we find
only a slow/weak softening of the alginate gel, <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., a reduction of the gel stiffness by about a
factor of 3 after 1 h (see Supporting Information, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03419/suppl_file/am5c03419_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Section S3 and Figure S2b</ext-link>). Thus, to achieve a stronger material
response within the time scale of typical rheological measurements,
we combine two chelating agents; and indeed, when using a mixture
comprising 500 mM EDTA and 250 mM citrate, we observe a reduction
of the stiffness of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cross-linked gel by 1 order
of magnitude within &#x0223c;1 h (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>c).</p><p>To enable a third cross-linking
mechanism, mucins were functionalized
with thiolated DNA strands (crDNA, see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Materials
and Methods</xref>). Those crDNA strands are partially self- complementary
and can act as a cross-linker by binding to other crDNA strands (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>) thus creating a
mechanism that converts mucin solutions into gels.<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr"/> However, different from the ionic or covalent cross-links
described above, those DNA-based cross-links form immediately when
crDNA-functionalized mucins are brought into contact. Thus, time-dependent
measurements are not very meaningful to demonstrate the implementation
of this cross-linking strategy, which is why we compare frequency
spectra obtained for unmodified mucins and crDNA-conjugated mucins
to demonstrate successful gelation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>d). Moreover, such crDNA/crDNA cross-links
can be removed again by the addition of a suitable displacement strand<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr"/> (dDNA, see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>), which&#x0e5f8;in the example shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>d&#x0e5f8;is efficient enough to turn a viscoelastic
mucin gel back into a viscoelastic fluid.</p><p>Having explored different
cross-linking options for the two pure
biopolymer systems, we next study hybrid systems containing a 1:1
mixture of alginate and mucin. Our goal is to generate a well-mixed
system of interpenetrating biopolymers, which can be dynamically cross-linked
and (partially) unlinked on demand. To assess the miscibility of the
two biopolymers, we produce a mixed sample in which a small fraction
of either biopolymer component is fluorescently labeled (see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). Microscopy images of such
an alginate/mucin blend demonstrate that, indeed, there is no visible
phase separation between the two macromolecules (see Supporting Information <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03419/suppl_file/am5c03419_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Section S5 and Figure S4</ext-link>)&#x0e5f8;at least not
at the length scale accessible to us by epifluorescence microscopy.
This suggests that, when evaluating the macrorheological response
of the mixed biopolymer system, we can expect both biopolymers to
contribute to the viscoelastic properties and that cross-linking of
either component should have a perceivable influence on the viscoelasticity
of the mixture.</p><p>To test this expectation, we next measured the
rheological response
of such mixed networks upon activation/deactivation of cross-links <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic>. We start with a combination of ionic and covalent
cross-links, where the former are supposed to predominantly act on
the (unmodified) alginate biopolymers whereas the latter should exclusively
form between methyacrylated mucins/alginates.</p><p>In a first set
of tests, 2% (w/v) mMUC is mixed with 2% (w/v) unmodified
alginate, and the system is first covalently stabilized with UV light
and then ionically cross-linked with 0.1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>. With
this particular order of the two cross-linking strategies, we observe
gel formation upon illumination with UV light and obtain a gel stiffness
of &#x0223c;30 Pa (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>a). When allowing Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to enter this covalently
cross-linked network through the hole-y plate, the stiffness of the
gel is further increased to &#x0223c;1.6 kPa. By exposing the double-cross-linked
network to the chelator mix introduced above, the number of ionic
cross-links can be successfully reduced, and the network is softened
to &#x0223c;300 Pa after 11 min. Similarly, we also find a stepwise
increase in the stiffness of the same biopolymer mixture when the
order of the two cross-linking steps is switched: now, a gel stiffness
of around 2.4 kPa is obtained after the first (= ionic) cross-linking
step, and the second, covalent cross-linking procedure slightly increases
this value to &#x0223c; 2.6 kPa (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>

(by 10% only) in
response to the second cross-linking step is&#x0e5f8;for many applications&#x0e5f8;not
sufficient; however, it is important to realize that the ionic cross-linking
step has already created quite a stiff network in the range of a few
kPa. We expect that, when starting with a lower baseline stiffness
after ionic cross-linking, the additional covalent cross-links should
have a stronger influence. Indeed, lowering the CaCl<sub>2</sub> concentration
by a factor 10 (to 0.01 M) has the desired effect: Now, we obtain
a gel stiffness of &#x0223c;10 Pa after ionic cross-linking and &#x0223c;
50 Pa after additional covalent cross-linking (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>

15 min to &#x0223c;20 Pa (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>c), which demonstrates the efficiency of this chelator
mix.</p><p>Having demonstrated that it is possible to tune the mechanical
properties of an alginate/mucin mixture in a (semireversible) two-step
process, we next ask if a similar result can be obtained if both cross-linking
agents target the same biopolymer component. In detail, we now mix
2% (w/v) unmodified mucin with 2% (w/v) mAlg and conduct the same
cross-linking steps as in the previous example. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>d, this adjusted
strategy results in a similar outcome as described in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>c, <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., a switch from &#x0223c;20 Pa (obtained after ionic cross-linking)
to &#x0223c;50 Pa, and back to &#x0223c;6 Pa after removing the ionic
cross-links again. In other words, the activation and inactivation
of the ionic cross-links both result in a change of the network stiffness
by an order of magnitude. This suggests that, in this particular case,
the chelators have fully removed the ionic cross-links from the network.</p><p>In several of those examples, dynamically switching the network
mechanics up and down was very well possible&#x0e5f8;but on rather
low levels of stiffness. Thus, in a next step, we ask if a similarly
dynamic behavior can also be obtained for stiffer samples, which we
aim to realize by mixing mMUC with mAlg. Now, different from the scenario
described above (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>b), the covalent cross-linking step should have a stronger influence
on the system and thus should also result in a perceivable modulation
of the network properties for samples with a higher initial stiffness
(which are created by using the higher CaCl<sub>2</sub> concentration
of 0.1 M again). And indeed, as depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>e, this is the case: now, the network stiffness
after ionic cross-linking is &#x0223c;400 Pa, after additional covalent
cross-linking &#x0223c;800 Pa, and after chelator addition &#x0223c;400
Pa again (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>e).</p><p>To test if a similar sequential activation of covalent and ionic
cross-links is also feasible when employing green light, the same
material combination of mMUC and mAlg is investigated again by changing
the light source from UV to green light (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>f). After bringing the system in contact
with a 0.1 M solution of CaCl<sub>2</sub>, a hydrogel with a stiffness
of &#x0223c;400 Pa is created due to ionic cross-linking, which agrees
very well with the data shown in (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>e). After activation of the covalent cross-links
upon illumination with green light, however, the gel stiffness reaches
values in the range of 1.5 kPa. As already observed for pure mAlg
systems, also here, the application of green light seems to entail
a stronger cross-linking of the sample compared to the result obtained
with UV (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>c). After bringing the double-cross-linked sample into contact with
the chelator solution, the stiffness is slightly decreased to &#x0223c;1.2
kPa. We speculate that, owing to the stronger effect of the covalent
cross-linking obtained in this sample (compared to the conditions
achieved with UV light), removing the ionic cross-links does not affect
the sample stiffness as much as one might expect.</p><p>In other words,
by relying on different ionic/covalent cross-linking
steps in combination with differently functionalized biopolymer components,
the mechanical properties of the same mixture of 2% (w/v) mucin and
2% (w/v) alginate can be dynamically switched back and forth on different
levels of initial and final stiffness (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>). As shown in Supporting Information, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03419/suppl_file/am5c03419_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Section S6 and Figure S5</ext-link>, with our approach,
a dynamic switch of hydrogel stiffness is even possible several times
in a row. This demonstrates that, when combining covalent and ionic
cross-links, the addition and removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions can
be repeated at will.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4" fig-type="figure"><label>4</label><caption><p>Overview over the storage moduli obtained for different

strategies described so far, a summarized overview of the storage
moduli obtained at the different stages of hydrogel manipulation is
shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>.
We note that, for many of the approaches tested here, a significant
change in stiffness can be achieved via the stepwise application of
the cross-linking/unlinking processes. Moreover, the distinct strategies
allow us to reach different ranges of starting and final stiffnesses,
thus rendering the composite material suitable for a variety of applications.</p><p>To this end, we have combined ionic and covalent cross-links in
different ways; however, we have not employed DNA-based cross-links
yet. In a previous study, we found that pure mucin systems stabilized
by such DNA-based cross-links have a very low stiffness,<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr"/> and this result is confirmed here: for mixed
networks comprising 2% (w/v) mucin and 2% (w/v) mAlg, crDNA-based
cross-links entail gels with a stiffness of around 0.4 Pa (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>a). After exposing
the sample to UV light, the stiffness of the gel is increased to &#x0223c;80
Pa; however, subsequent addition of dDNA strands (which are supposed
to open the crDNA/crDNA cross-links) has no perceivable effect on
the gel stiffness. This result is not surprising considering that
the influence of the crDNA cross-links on the sample stiffness is
very low&#x0e5f8;yet those crDNA-based cross-links are sufficient to
provide a soft gel as a starting point for further sample modification.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5" fig-type="figure"><label>5</label><caption><p>Viscoelastic

adding a chelator mix. The EDTA schematic shows an exemplary tetrahedral
coordination; octahedral coordination is not depicted. Data shown

cross-links can
also be further stiffened by ionic cross-links: for instance, supplying
0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> (through the hole-y plate setup) to a soft
mucin gel yields stiffness values of &#x0223c;25 Pa (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>b). Now, the ionic cross-links
can be removed again by employing the same chelator mixture described
above, which results in a reduced gel stiffness of around 4 Pa. Thus,
with this third cross-linker variant based on DNA/DNA interactions,
dynamically switching the stiffness of mixed mucin/alginate gels is
also possible and extends the range of possible stiffness values toward
the &#x0201c;soft&#x0201d; regime (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>).</p><p>The hydrogel system presented here
comes with several options to
vary the type and level of cross-linking, which should allow for tailoring
the viscoelastic properties of the gels over a broad stiffness range.
First, the overall biopolymer concentration (which was kept constant
in this study for better comparability of the different systems) can
be adjusted to soften or stiffen the hydrogels. As indicated in Supporting
Information, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03419/suppl_file/am5c03419_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Section S7</ext-link>, even without performing
any cross-linking steps, such a strategy can already significantly
affect the mechanical properties of the system. Second, in addition
to varying the ion concentration used for cross-linking, also the
type of cations used for ionic cross-linking can be altered. Here,
trivalent ions would offer the option to bind to GG as well as GM
groups (&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-mannuronate (M) and &#x003b1;-<sc>l</sc>-guluronate
(G) alginate subunits, which are arranged in polymannuronate (MM),
polyguluronate (GG), and mixed GM domains) of alginate,<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr"/> which should result in a higher cross-linking
density than what can be achieved with Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, such
an approach might affect the cytocompatibility of the system, which
would require further investigations. Third, the degree of functionalization
(here: methacrylation) of the employed biopolymers is a key parameter
that can be adjusted to tune the effect of covalent cross-linking.
In this context, also the concentration of the photoinitiator used
can be varied to achieve a desired stiffness level. Thus, there are
several parameters in the presented hydrogel system that can be tuned
(more or less independently from each other) to further tailor the
stiffness of the created material, either toward softer or stiffer
hydrogels. In addition, altering the cross-linking strategy also affects
the swelling and degradation behavior of the gels (see Supporting
Information, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03419/suppl_file/am5c03419_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Section S8 and Figure S7</ext-link>).</p><p>In a next step, to investigate the biocompatibility of the aforementioned
systems for possible biomedical applications, we conduct cytotoxicity
tests to determine the effect of the generated biopolymer gels themselves
on the cell viability as well as the effect of the chemicals/light
exposure used to generate the cross-linking processes. For doing so,
human epithelial (HeLa) cells are incubated with medium which has
been incubated with the different gel formulations prior to its application
to the cells. This mimics a scenario where cells get into contact
with the final, already cross-linked material (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., cell seeding tests), but are not directly exposed to
the UV light or the cross-linking agents. Representative microscopy
images of this experiment can be seen in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>a. As depicted in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>b, the MUC-mAlg blend system entails no significant
decrease in cell viability compared to the control&#x0e5f8;and this
outcome is independent of whether or not the photoinitiator required
for cross-linking was added to the material (we find cell viability
values of &#x0223c; 93% in both cases). This suggests that the photoinitiator
does not leave cytotoxic residues once the cross-linked system is
created. In contrast, all the remaining blend systems investigated
here lead to a significant decrease in cellular viability compared
to the control group. However, all determined viability values are
above 70%, and this is the threshold below which, according to ISO
10993&#x02013;5, a material would be considered cytotoxic.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6" fig-type="figure"><label>6</label><caption><p>Viability experiments

covered with medium containing the corresponding photoinitiator and
then exposed to one of the two different light types (<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., UV or green light, see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>d). The results obtained from these tests
would be relevant for such applications, in which cells are directly
embedded into the biopolymer mixture before gelation of the system
is induced. Also here, we find cell viability values above 70% in
all cases, which indicates the suitability of our systems for cell
culture applications. In more detail, we determine a viability level
of &#x0223c;84% for illumination with UV light and of &#x0223c;86% for
illumination with green light, which is comparable to the control
group. However, when conducting the light exposure tests in the presence
of the respective photoinitiator, we find a significantly lower cell
viability than for the control group, <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., &#x0223c;72% (UV light) and &#x0223c;76% (green light). This indicates
that the radical formation triggered by the photo initiators during
either of the cross-linking reactions might impact the cell viability.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

</xref>d, this issue did not occur since the cells
were not in contact with the material when the cross-linking reaction
employing light illumination was conducted. Together, this implies
that, in those cases, the radical reaction was already completed when
the cells were seeded onto the materials, or that only a low, unproblematic
concentration of radicals was left at this time point. Still, when
further tuning one of the mixed biopolymer systems for applications
in <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> cell culture assays or tissue engineering,
it might be necessary to adapt the concentrations of the photo initiators
and/or the light exposure times (see Supporting Information, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03419/suppl_file/am5c03419_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Section S9</ext-link>). Data obtained after 24 h of incubation

with green light does not entail a significant decrease in viability
compared to the control, and this underscores our expectation that
UV light is more harmful to cells.</p><p>In a final step of this study,
we aim at demonstrating the biological

of well-mixed, biocompatible
mucin/alginate composite hydrogels with dynamically switchable cross-links
and antibacterial properties. Current hydrogel materials that allow
for a dynamic switching of their viscoelastic properties mostly rely
on synthetic polymers (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., polyacrylamide-azobenzene

<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content>). There, especially the long

of those systems<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> constitute a major drawback.
Here, we obtained hydrogels, in which altering the viscoelastic response
is rapidly possible. So far, we obtained the most promising results
when combining ionic and covalent cross-links, or when combining DNA-based
cross-links with ionic cross-links. The achievable gel stiffness range,
within which such DNA-based cross-links are helpful tools to tune
the mechanical properties of the hybrid system is, however, limited.
Here, a modification of the DNA-based construct could be considered, <italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., to achieve higher cross-linking densities
(and thus a stronger effect of the DNA-based cross-links on the gel
stiffness) or to allow for &#x0201c;switching on&#x0201d; the DNA-based
cross-links on demand. Previous work by Fujita et al.<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr"/> on hyaluronic acid based hydrogels cross-linked with single-stranded
DNA suggests that this should be possible since, in that study, gels
with stiffnesses of &#x0223c;100 Pa were obtained.</p><p>The ability
to tailor the viscoelastic properties of the hybrid
material in combination with the good biocompatibility of the biopolymer
components renders this system a promising candidate for use in biomedical
applications. By combining an advanced material design with real-time
monitoring, our study contributes to the development of &#x0201c;switchable&#x0201d;
hydrogels, which can have broad applications in microfluidics, tissue
engineering, and regenerative medicine. For instance, making use of
the dynamically switchable cross-links in mucin/alginate networks
could be very interesting for biosensing, organ-on-chip technologies,
or the microfluidic encapsulation of cells:<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr"/> in the context of the latter, the ability to change the mechanical
properties of the cell environment on demand in combination with the
antibacterial properties of the mucin might be very interesting to
guide the differentiation of stem cells.<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr"/> Composite hydrogels with dynamic stiffness and the technical ability

alterations in real-time. Moreover, the hydrogel system proposed here
could be a suitable model system for applications in the field of

Fully complementary dDNA strands comprising 22 bases are designed
such that they have a higher binding affinity to the crDNA strands
than the crDNA strands have to themselves. Thus, when dDNA strands
are added to a hybridized crDNA/crDNA pair, they will open this hybridization
by triggering a displacement reaction. Previously, the online DNA

of forming the envisioned base pairings described above; moreover,

the reservoir located in underneath, get cross-linked and thus prevents
the diffusive entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the sample; second,
larger amounts of the cross-linking solution can enter the sample

attached syringe pump system, which is connected to the hole-y plate
via a tube (diameter of &#x0223c;1 mm) using needles (diameter of 0.8
mm, B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) and a Luer-lock adapter. When processing
ion solutions or chelating agents, the pump was set to a throughput
rate of 0.5 mL/min. When processing DNA solutions, the settings were
adapted to 50 &#x003bc;L/min for dDNA and 200 &#x003bc;L/min for CaCl<sub>2</sub> and the chelator solution. For very soft samples, switching
on the pump during a running measurement induced artifacts in the
recorded data (see Supporting Information, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03419/suppl_file/am5c03419_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Section S14</ext-link>), which were then removed before averaging curves. Each
experiment was performed with <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.8.2"><title>Setups for Light-Triggered Cross-Linking</title><p>In this study,
two different setups for the light-induced cross-linking of biopolymers <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> were employed: A commercially available, UV-transparent
rheometer plate (P-PTD200/GL, Anton Paar, Graz, Austria) was used
for sample illumination from below. However, this measuring setup
does not allow for the dynamic addition of molecules to the sample
during a measurement as it prevents usage of the &#x0201c;hole-y plate&#x0201d;
described above. Thus, to enable a light-triggered cross-linking process
from above (that is compatible with the use of the &#x02018;hole-y
plate&#x02019;), a bespoke measuring head was developed, that allows
for the transmission of visible/UV light. This measuring head (see

be connected to a commercial adapter (D-CP/PP7, Anton Paar) and was
fabricated from a certain poly&#x000ad;(methyl methacrylate) variant (PMMA,
Plexiglas XT 0A070, R&#x000f6;hm GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany), which has
a low absorbance behavior in the UV range (see Supporting Information, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03419/suppl_file/am5c03419_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Section S2</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4.9"><title>Shear Rheology Tests</title><p>The viscoelastic properties of
the samples were determined using a research-grade shear rheometer
(MCR302, Anton Paar) equipped with a planar measuring head PP 25 (PP25/Q1&#x02013;79044,
Anton Paar). Depending on the setup, either a temperature-controllable
planar bottom plate (P-PTD200/56, Anton Paar) or a plate with a thread
(P-PTD200/80/1, Anton Paar) to attach the hole-y plate was used. Before
performing any measurement, the setup was initialized and calibrated.
When using the hole-y plate, the gap size for the measurements was
set to 0.4 mm; when analyzing DNA containing samples, the gap size
was reduced to 0.1 mm to reduce the required sample. Sample volumes
of 200 and 100 &#x003bc;L, respectively, were carefully placed onto
the measuring plate before lowering the measuring head into its position.
A gelation curve and/or frequency spectra (obtained for oscillation
frequencies of <italic toggle="yes">f</italic> = 0.1 to 10 Hz) were conducted after
60 s of equilibration time; in either case, the storage and the loss
modulus of the sample were recorded. A pre-experiment was carried
out before every frequency sweep to guarantee linear material response;
here, the shear strain was set to 1.5 times the average shear strain
obtained in 5 repetitions at an oscillatory torque of 0.5 &#x003bc;N&#x000b7;m.
All rheological experiments were conducted at a constant temperature
of 20 &#x000b0;C. Each experiment was performed with <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3.</p><sec id="sec4.9.1"><title>Chelator Induced Removal of Ionic Cross-Links</title><p>After
ionically cross-linking alginate-based hydrogels, the cross-links
were partially removed by binding the incorporated ions with chelators.
For doing so in an <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> process, the reservoir
was first flushed with ddH<sub>2</sub>O to completely remove the cross-linking
agent from the hole-y plate. Afterward, another syringe was connected
to the setup and filled with the chelating agent, <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., a mixture of 0.5 M EDTA (powder) and 0.25 M
citrate solution.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.9.2"><title>DNA Controlled Opening of Cross-Links</title><p>To open the DNA-based
cross-links in mixed mucin/alginate hydrogels, dDNA was added to the
sample. Therefore, a solution of 50 &#x003bc;M dDNA prepared in RNase-free
water containing 0.1 mM EDTA was added to the sample via the hole-y
plate setup.</p><p>Here, the aforementioned pumping system was used
to fill the reservoir of the hole-y plate with the dDNA solution.
To better detect the weak effect that DNA-based cross-links have on
the sample stiffness, the rheometer settings for obtaining the gelation
curves were adapted to 0.1 &#x003bc;N&#x000b7;m and 0.2 Hz to achieve a
higher sensitivity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4.10"><title>Cytotoxicity Tests</title><p>To investigate the effect of the
different material combinations as well as the cross-linking agents
on the viability of cells, a cytotoxicity assay was performed with
HeLa cells. Here, 2 mL of the different materials (mMUC-Alg, MUC-mALg
and mMUC-mAlg) were prepared and cross-linked with UV light, crDNA,
and/or 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Afterward, 3 mL of cell culture medium

using 0.22 &#x003bc;m filters to achieve sterile conditions, and 100
&#x003bc;L of the obtained solution was added to each well; the cells
were incubated with this medium at 37 &#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> overnight. Afterward, the cells were stained with a live/dead staining

that this method kills all cells (data not shown).</p><p>The effect
of the light exposure process required for covalent cross-linking
(using UV or green light) was assessed using HeLa cells as well. Therefore,
HeLa cells were seeded into 96 well plates with a glass bottom (10,000

Austria) to allow for light exposure from below. The seeded cells
were incubated in 100 &#x003bc;L of cell culture medium overnight at
37 &#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For the viability assessment on
the next day, the culture medium was replaced with 150 &#x003bc;L of
either pure medium or medium supplemented with a photoinitiator. The
well plate was subsequently illuminated with either UV light (for
10 min) or with green light (for 5 min). Afterward, the wells were
washed with DPBS (Merck) and stained with the aforementioned live/dead
staining solution. Subsequently, the samples were imaged using a fluorescence
microscope (Leica) and analyzed with the software ImageJ. The cells
were then incubated overnight, and the staining and imaging process
was repeated the next day. Cells incubated with sterile methanol for
2 min and washed with DPBS (Merck) before further processing were
again used as a control group; also here, all cells were killed by
the methanol exposure (data not shown). Each experiment was performed
