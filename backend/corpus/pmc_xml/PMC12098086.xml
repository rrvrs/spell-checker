However, the risk associated with RNA methylation-related miRNAs (RMRMs) in the HCC immune microenvironment remains largely unknown. Here, we predicted the correlation between RMRM risk and immune cell infiltration in HCC using machine learning. </p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>MiRNA sequencing data was used to identify RMRMs. A risk score model of HCC was developed utilizing four RMRMs, including miR-551a, miR-4739, miR-326, and miR-210-3p.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients with high-risk scores exhibited poorer prognoses. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis revealed the high-risk group exhibited increased infiltration levels of several immune cell subtypes, including myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC), macrophage, and T cells. The data integration of scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq showed the decreased TIDE score in the high-risk patients and the elevated levels of Macro-secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), MDSC-meiotic nuclear divisions 1 (MND1), &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells, and Macro-complement C1q C chain (C1QC) predicted adverse prognosis. ScRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data integration unveiled the spatial distribution of RMRMs risk scores and their correlation with immune cell subtype localization. Risk model-based clustering of HCC samples revealed that cluster 2, characterized by a higher risk score, correlated with a poorer prognosis and reduced immune and stromal scores. In vitro, the overexpression of miR-4739 in Huh-7 cells significantly induced SPP1<sup>+</sup> macrophages, and the culture medium derived from SPP1<sup>+</sup> macrophages further promoted the proliferation and migration of Huh-7 cells. Furthermore, miR-4739 reduced m1A methylation by inhibiting tRNA methyltransferase 61A (TRMT61A) expression. </p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study reveals that the RMRM risk model could effectively predict the prognosis of HCC, and SPP1<sup>+</sup> macrophages regulated by miR-4739-RNA methylation promote the proliferation and migration of HCC cells.

HCC is characterized by strong invasiveness, uncomplicated metastasis, and poor prognosis (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Due to the lack of noticeable symptoms in the early stages of HCC, patients are often diagnosed when the disease has already progressed to an advanced stage (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Current management options for HCC include traditional drug treatment, Radio-Frequency Ablation, systemic molecular, resections in regional, and liver transplants (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, these approaches are limited in their efficacy of HCC. The immune microenvironment plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of HCC, and immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the management of HCC (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Although immunotherapy has achieved significant breakthroughs in the treatment of HCC, the clinical outcomes of HCC for advanced stages are still unfavorable due to the heterogeneity of HCC in terms of molecular and cellular signatures. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify easily quantifiable immune-related biomarkers for early detection or therapeutic indicators of HCC.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs), known for their role in regulating gene expression, hold substantial promise in the prognostic evaluation and therapeutic management of HCC (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In fact, the role of miRNAs in the immune response of HCC has been validated. For example, endoplasmic reticulum stress induces HCC cells to release exosomal miRNA-23a-3p, which in turn upregulates the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in macrophages (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). MiRNA-223 can attenuate hepatocarcinogenesis by blocking hypoxia-driven angiogenesis and immunosuppression (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Hu et&#x000a0;al. indicated that miRNA-22 reduced the abundance of interleukin 17 (IL17)-producing T cells and inhibited IL17 signaling in HCC (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). These studies highlight the role and involvement of miRNAs in the immunity of HCC. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the potential of miRNA as a biomarker for HCC and the underlying regulatory mechanisms of miRNA on the HCC immune microenvironment.</p><p>In recent years, up to 170 distinct chemical modifications have been identified in RNA molecules, with N1-methyladenosine (m1A), N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and N7-methylguanosine (m7G) being particularly significant (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The role of RNA methylation has been revealed in HCC. Specifically, the m6A methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)promotes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-induced HCC (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The m1A methylation levels in tRNA are remarkably elevated in tumor tissues of HCC patients and are negatively associated with the survival of HCC patients (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). m5C is highly conserved in different species, and the distribution pattern of m5C in diversified RNA forms is species-specific (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Tumor microenvironment (TME) and prognosis of HCC are significantly influenced by the patterns of m5C modification (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Notably, a lower patient survival rate was significantly related to higher expression of almost all m5C regulators in HCC. The upregulation of tRNA m7G methyltransferase complex components METTL1 and WD repeat domain 4 has enhanced lapatinib resistance in HCC and increased sensitivity to METTL1-targeting therapies (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). MiRNAs are virtually involved at the post-transcriptional level and bind to 3&#x02019; UTR of their target mRNA to regulate gene expression (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Some studies have indicated that miRNAs can bind RNA methylation-related genes to regulate HCC biological processes (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, it is still unclear whether miRNAs regulate the HCC immune microenvironment by binding to RNA methylation-related genes.</p><p>To explore the relationships of m6A/m5C/m1A/m7G-related miRNAs with the immune microenvironment of HCC, we established a risk model of RNA methylation-related miRNAs (RMRMs) in HCC using micro RNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) data and machine learning algorithms. We verified their reliability in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomic data. In this study, we identified four RMRMs associated with the risk model of HCC and assessed the effects of RNA methylation-related miR-4739 in macrophages on HCC cells. Our findings provide a new scientific basis for developing biomarkers and targeted therapeutic molecules for HCC based on immunology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>MiRNA -seq data analysis</title><p>We downloaded miRNA-seq data in TCGA-LIHC samples from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) database (<ext-link xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/" ext-link-type="uri">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/</ext-link>).

A growing body of evidence has revealed significantly abnormal RNA methylation levels and the dysregulation of enzymes related to RNA methylation in HCC tissues and cell lines (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). However, a few studies have focused on using miRNAs associated with RNA methylation modifications to predict HCC. Previous studies have demonstrated a crosstalk between miRNA and RNA methylation in HCC (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Our study also validated that RNA methylation-related genes were the target genes of differentially expressed miRNA between HCC and normal samples. Subsequently, these RMRMs were used to construct prognostic risk models. After pre-screening calculations, we identified 4 miRNAs associated with the prognosis of HCC, including miRNA-551a, miRNA-4739, miRNA-326, and miRNA210-3p. A previous study reported that increased expression of microRNA 551a blocks breast tumorigenesis (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). MiR-4739 serves as a biomarker of doxorubicin chemoresistance in breast cancer, with its overexpression facilitating the proliferation, progression, and survival of cancer cells (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). MiRNA-326 regulates the progression of various cancers (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) and has diagnostic and prognostic roles in HCC (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). These findings highlight the reliability of the four RMRMs in the prognostic prediction of HCC. In this study, HCC samples in TCGA-LIHC could be categorized into high- and low-risk groups based on the expressions of 4 RMRMs. ScRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data also validate the effectiveness of this prognostic risk model. Specifically, scRNA-seq analysis revealed differences in risk scores among various immune cell subtypes in HBV-HCC and HBV tissues, with the high-risk group significantly enriched in tumorigenesis and immune regulation pathways, indicating that the risk model effectively distinguishes risk characteristics of different immune cell subtypes. Spatial transcriptomics further validated the spatial distribution of risk scores within the tumor microenvironment, showing that high-risk score regions highly overlapped with tumor areas and were positively correlated with the spatial localization of specific cell types (such as Epi-SRGN), confirming the effectiveness of the risk model at the spatial level. RMRMs should be considered for better disease management.</p><p>Our results revealed the relationship of the prognostic risk model of RMRMs with the immune response.
