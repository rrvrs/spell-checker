The intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) are a sparsely-distributed subtype of RGCs in the human retina that express the photopigment melanopsin. Whilst some ipRGCs receive synaptic input from rods and cones, the melanopsin photopigment additionally makes ipRGCs independently sensitive to short-wavelength light [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The exact function of ipRGCs in humans remains a topic of investigation, but they are known to contribute primarily to non-image forming vision, including the pupillary light reflex and the synchronisation of the circadian clock to the environmental light-dark cycle [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Histological evidence suggests that ipRGCs are lost in glaucoma, similar to other RGC subtypes [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Loss of ipRGCs is unlikely to be detected by clinical visual field tests due to their minimal contribution to image-forming vision, nor by optical coherence tomography due to their low number relative to other RGC classes. Loss or dysfunction of ipRGCs may, however, manifest as alterations to the post-illumination pupil response (PIPR), which is thought to reflect largely melanopsin signals. Several studies have shown reductions in the group-mean PIPR in experimental participants with glaucoma as compared to age-similar healthy control participants [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. One study has further attempted to localise the stimulus to retinal quadrants and measure diagnostic accuracy, showing promising results for detection of glaucoma [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These previous studies have used narrowband red and blue lights to stimulate pupil reactions, finding a reduced PIPR in glaucoma compared to control groups. A limitation of these previous studies is that narrowband light of any wavelength will always activate all photoreceptors because photoreceptor spectral sensitivities are highly overlapping [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This imperfect isolation means that the measured pupil response in previous studies is not specific to the melanopsin-driven component of ipRGC responses, and their loss of function in glaucoma may be partly masked as a result.</p><p>Previous studies of the healthy visual system have used silent substitution methods to produce stimuli that more accurately isolate the response of melanopsin, and, therefore, the ipRGCs from those of cone photopigments [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this study, we use the method of silent substitution to measure pupil responses to melanopsin-directed stimuli in human participants with glaucoma and age-similar healthy controls. We hypothesised that by isolating melanopsin in this way, we would be able to measure differences in pupil response between participants with glaucoma and healthy controls, and aimed to test whether this technique has potential as a clinical diagnostic test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We measured pupil responses to melanopsin-directed and L-M-S-cone (LMS) photoreceptor-directed (henceforth termed LMS-directed) stimuli in participants with glaucoma and age-similar healthy control participants. Melanopsin-directed stimuli consisted of stimulus pairs with matched contrast on LMS-cone photopigments (&#x0003c;6% absolute contrast) but maximal contrast (~325%) on melanopsin. LMS-directed stimuli were presented as a control, and consisted of stimulus pairs matched for their contrast on melanopsin (&#x0003c;6% absolute contrast) whilst matching their contrast on LMS to that of the melanopsin-directed stimuli on melanopsin (~325%). We additionally measured pupil responses to narrowband red (657&#x02009;nm) and blue (471&#x02009;nm) stimuli, similar to previous studies, in a subset of our participants. See <italic toggle="yes">Apparatus &#x00026; Stimuli</italic> later for further details of the stimuli used.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants with glaucoma and age-similar healthy control participants were recruited from a database of those who had previously attended or registered interest for studies conducted at the University of Bradford. Participants with glaucoma had open-angle glaucoma confirmed by either written diagnosis from a consultant ophthalmologist or self-report with evidence of current glaucoma treatment. All participants with glaucoma had a circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (cpRNFL) defect defined as at least one sector with p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1% on Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Germany) optical coherence tomography (OCT), and a visual defect defined as Mean Deviation p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5% and/or 3 contiguous non-edge points with Pattern Deviation p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5% and/or Glaucoma Hemifield Test outside normal limits on a SITA standard 24&#x02013;2 visual field test (Humphrey Field Analyzer 3, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany).

For each participant, stimuli were presented in blocks of 30 trials, broken down into three runs of 10 trials with short breaks in-between each run. For the red/blue stimuli 15 trials of each stimulus were presented in random order across the block of 30 trials. Red/blue stimuli were always presented first in the session, followed by LMS-directed stimuli and then melanopsin-directed stimuli last. All blocks started with a 4.5 minute background adaptation period in which the background spectra was presented for the melanopsin- and LMS-directed stimuli and no light was presented for the red/blue stimuli (i.e., dark adaptation). Individual trials started with a 400&#x02013;600&#x02009;ms dark flash which enabled temporal synchronisation between the light source and pupil tracker. Background illumination as above was then restored for a pre-pulse interval of random duration between 10 and 12s prior to the 3s stimulus pulse [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], followed by a return to background illumination for a 15s post-pulse period. After a run of 10 trials had been completed, participants took a break of approximately 1 minute before the next run was initiated with a 30s background/dark re-adaptation period. A break of up to 5 minutes was taken between blocks. We did not include longer dark adaptation because initial pilot testing showed no difference in pupil responses with or without 30 minutes of dark adaptation and a requirement for long periods of dark adaptation would limit clinical applicability of the protocol.

Fitted pupil diameters were then processed in Python to remove blinks. Data were masked if the first derivative of the pupil size exceeded&#x02009;+&#x02009;/-3 standard deviations or if the corresponding confidence value provided by the pupillometer software was below 0.95.

Our silent substitution method allowed us to present pairs of spectral stimuli directed to elicit minimal response from cone photoreceptors while providing sufficient contrast on melanopsin-based ipRGCs to generate a pupil response driven by these cells. The persistent post-illumination pupil constriction with the melanopsin-directed stimuli compared to those to cone photoreceptor-targeted stimuli are consistent with prior data on pupil responses to melanopsin-directed stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and, therefore, suggest that our stimuli were successful in differentially stimulating the melanopsin cells.</p><p>Differences in pupil responses to melanopsin-directed stimuli between our glaucoma and control groups were minimal and not statistically significant for any of the tested parameters. Similarly, we found no significant differences between the groups in any of the parameters tested for LMS-directed stimuli, nor for 6s or 8.9s PIPR using narrowband red and blue light stimuli. This similarity occurred for the pupillometric measures despite the groups being easily separable based on conventional clinical OCT and visual field tests due to the inclusion criteria. Our data, therefore, suggest that pupillometric measurements of melanopsin-driven ipRGC function are not likely to be clinically useful as diagnostic biomarkers of glaucoma.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate pupil responses to melanopsin-directed silent substitution stimuli in glaucoma. Previous studies have measured the PIPR using narrowband red/blue stimuli, finding statistically significant between-group differences [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In our study, this difference was not statistically significant (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.42), but a larger difference in PIPR was found at 8.9s post stimulus offset (<xref rid="pone.0324373.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). This difference did not quite reach statistical significance (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09), though we note that our sample size for this comparison is smaller than some previous studies and a comparable sample size to previous studies may have rendered an effect of this size statistically significant. There are other differences between our study and previous studies of the PIPR to narrowband red/blue stimuli that may also have contributed to the different result. We used an integrating sphere rather than a Maxwellian-view or similar system as in most previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These previous studies also stimulated through one pupil, which was typically pharmacologically-dilated, whilst measuring the consensual pupil responses of the unstimulated fellow eye [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We did not use any pharmacological dilation as we measured the direct pupil responses of the stimulated eye whilst the fellow eye was occluded. Whilst this may have contributed to some differences in the form of the pupil response, perhaps explaining the different time-point of maximum between-group PIPR difference, we do not think this explains any reduction in between-group differences. We note that we are not the first to use a type of integrating sphere along with a head-mounted pupillometer, as our method is broadly similar to that of Najjar et al. who used a similar pupillometer in conjunction with a Ganzfeld bowl system to measure pupil responses to narrowband stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In our data the narrowband PIPR stimuli came closer to achieving both a statistically-significant between-group mean difference and a diagnostic accuracy significantly better than chance, at least for the 8.9s post offset timepoint, than did any of the melanopsin-directed stimulus parameters. One possible explanation is that responses to the narrowband stimuli also include a significant rod component (as they are pulsed from the dark), and overall have larger, but non-isolating, contrast on the melanopsin system. As our silent-substitution method used stimulus contrasts consistent with prior studies, reaching the near-limit of contrast for multi-primary systems, a further optimisation of silent-substitution stimulus parameters may not be feasible [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The small sample size is a limitation of our study in detecting between-group differences. However, the purpose of our study was not simply to detect a mean difference between groups, but rather to test whether this technique has potential for use as a diagnostic test for glaucoma. Between-group differences in mean parameters are not sufficient to demonstrate clinical utility as a diagnostic test. Therefore, though a larger sample may have rendered small between-group differences statistically significant, adding further participants to the sample would be unlikely to change the conclusion that these measures are not suitable for use as a diagnostic test. Diagnostic performance in this study was close to chance, meaning that even a larger sample using these methods would be unlikely to yield an acceptable performance. For example, to achieve even a modest 70% sensitivity at 90% specificity requires the means of two normally distributed groups to be separated by 1.8 standard deviations (Cohen&#x02019;s d&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.8). Our study had more than 99% power to detect differences of this size with alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 at the achieved sample sizes, and therefore even greater power to detect the greater between-group separation required to attain the higher sensitivity and specificity needed for a clinical glaucoma test.</p><p>It is possible that between-group differences would have been larger had we recruited participants with more advanced glaucoma. This has been the case in previous studies showing either a greater difference in more advanced disease [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], not showing a significant difference in early disease but doing so in advanced disease [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], or only including advanced cases in the glaucoma group [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The visual field mean deviation in our glaucoma group was mean -5.72dB (standard deviation 2.67dB) which represents moderate loss, but is still less than half of the mean in Kankipati et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] or the &#x0201c;Late&#x0201d; group in Adhikari et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] A further histological study found melanopsin-based RGC loss in severe glaucoma eyes, but not in early glaucoma eyes post-mortem [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The participants in our glaucoma group were, through the inclusion criteria, already readily detected by conventional visual field and OCT diagnostic tests (both would have an area under the ROC curve of 1.0). Therefore, any new diagnostic test that only picks up more advanced cases than these would be of limited clinical use.</p><p>It is worth considering whether changes to the stimulus or protocol may be beneficial in eliciting a diagnostically-useful effect. Our pilot data suggested that our PIPR results did not differ with or without 30 minutes of dark adaptation, and we used 4.5 minutes of dark adaptation in our protocol. Some previous studies have used longer periods (e.g., 10 minutes) of dark adaptation in eliciting a strong PIPR [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The aim of our study was to test potential as a clinical diagnostic test, and the requirement for long periods of dark adaptation limits the clinical applicability of a test. A further modifiable parameter is the pulse duration. We chose a 3s stimulus pulse as used successfully by McAdams et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but Park et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found that a 1s pulse elicited a larger PIPR than a 3.16s pulse in healthy subjects. It is therefore possible that a shorter pulse, with or without additional dark adaptation may have elicited a greater between-group difference. For the red/blue narrowband stimuli, the protocol used means that it is possible that some sustained pupil constriction from the blue stimulus persisted into trials with the red stimulus. This may have affected the size of the red-blue PIPR found in some participants, however this counterbalanced design has been previously successful [<xref rid="pone.0324373.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We re-iterate that, even in these groups of participants easily distinguished by current imperfect clinical tests, none of our metrics performed close to a clinically-useful level in terms of sensitivity/specificity or ROC area (<xref rid="pone.0324373.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Therefore, whilst some changes to the stimulus or protocol may improve the performance, and may yield further statistically significant differences between group means, improvements would have to be greater than we would expect in order to achieve the high levels of sensitivity and specificity required for clinical glaucoma diagnosis.</p><p>A further limitation of our method is that we did not adjust the stimuli to account for individual differences in ocular media transmission. Particularly, 8 of the glaucoma participants and 2 of the control participants had artificial intraocular lenses following cataract surgery. We considered that variations in ocular transmission, which are also affected by age-related changes in the cornea and vitreous, are a contributory factor to between-individual variation that a clinical test must overcome. Nevertheless, we did perform a post-hoc comparison of the responses to the melanopsin-directed stimulus between the glaucoma participants who had not had cataract surgery to those of the control group. Although this comparison is less well-controlled and lower powered than the main analysis, the results were similar to those in <xref rid="pone.0324373.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, with no statistically significant differences in these parameters. A clinical test could potentially offer different settings for participants with/without intraocular lenses and by age, and this may be worthy of further study if spectral settings can be found that substantially reduce between-individual variability.</p><p>In conclusion, we have measured pupil responses to melanopsin-directed silent substitution stimuli in age-similar participants with and without conventionally-diagnosed glaucoma. The pupil responses to melanopsin-directed stimuli were similar between groups and thus are unlikely to be suitable as a basis for diagnostic tests for glaucoma. Further studies may evaluate the efficacy of similar approaches in other conditions, such as outer retinal disease, where results may differ.</p></sec><sec id="sec009" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0324373.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Spectral response of the stimulation system.</title><p>(left) Spectral response of the stimulation system measured at the corneal plane for each of the independent primaries, and (right) the gamut of the device plotted on the CIE 1931 chromaticity horseshoe.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0324373.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0324373.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Boxplots of pupil diameters for each group/stimulus during the baseline period of 1s prior to stimulus onset.</title><p>Pupil diameters during the baseline period within 1s prior to stimulus onset for all stimuli.
