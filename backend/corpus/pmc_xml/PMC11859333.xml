Recent studies provided evidence supporting the use of meditation as a promising adjuvant tool for improving the mental health and quality of life of cancer survivors.</p></sec><sec id="sec7148"><title>Objectives</title><p>
The present study aims to carry out a clinical trial to evaluate the effects of an online group of meditation program of Kundalini Yoga on breast cancer women, through a longitudinal and randomized research design, in the following variables: psychological morbidity, self-compassion, spirituality, and quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="sec7149"><title>Methods</title><p>This study had the participation of 35 participants distributed randomly for 3 equivalent groups (N=11 EG, N=13 ACG, N=11 PCG), with the diagnosis of breast cancer, aged between 34 and 78 years.</p><p>The sample of women with breast cancer was randomly selected from a breast cancer support association.</p><p>The protocol was applied online individually on pre-test, post-test, and 1-month follow-up moments, in 3 comparison groups: 1) the Experimental Group(EG), who practiced yoga Kundalini meditation; 2) the Active Control Group(ACG) that practiced relaxation; 3) the waiting list Passive Control Group(PCG). Intervention sessions were carried out for the EG and the ACG, in an online format, lasting about 30 minutes, weekly, for 8 weeks. Statistical analyses were considered at a 0.05 significance level. All analyses were performed with IBM SPSS, version 27.</p></sec><sec id="sec7150"><title>Results</title><p>The results showed that the group that did yoga kundalini meditation (EG) had benefits, unlike the control groups, in the variables of emotional functioning, global spiritual well-being, and personal well-being. There were statistically significant differences in the overall self-compassion score when comparing the 3-time points in all groups. The sub-scale of self-kindness and transcendental well-being shows an increase significantly between the 3 moments in the active control group. The passive control group performed significantly worse over time in the self-kindness.</p></sec><sec id="sec7151"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on preliminary results, the Experimental Group (EG) exhibited improvements in Self-Compassion, Spirituality, and Emotional Functioning (as evaluated by the QLQ C-30) following eight consecutive weeks of online Kundalini Yoga Meditation practice. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting meditation&#x02019;s potential to enhance life quality and spiritual well-being in individuals with breast cancer. These preliminary findings suggest that further research in this promising field is warranted.</p></sec><sec id="sec7152"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
