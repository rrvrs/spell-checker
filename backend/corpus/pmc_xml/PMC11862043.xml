Chronic opiate use may lead to inflammation, and elevated inflammation markers have been observed in individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). The Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) serves as an indicator of systemic inflammation. NLR can be employed in both diagnosis and treatment monitoring as an inflammatory marker to gauge the severity of OUD.</p></sec><sec id="sec2872"><title>Objectives</title><p>Our aim was to assess the utility of NLR as a marker of chronic inflammation in diagnosing and monitoring treatment in individuals with OUD.</p></sec><sec id="sec2873"><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 200 patients with OUD and 78 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study. Patients were initially admitted to a 28-day abstinence-based inpatient program and subsequently transitioned to outpatient buprenorphine/naloxone (B/N) maintenance treatment after hospitalization at the Alcohol and Substance Addiction Treatment Center in Trakya University School of Medicine (Edirne, T&#x000fc;rkiye). NLR was employed as a measure of systemic inflammation. Blood samples were collected the morning following admission for detoxification. Patients were categorized into two groups: the treatment retention group and the dropout/relapse group based on their 3-month and 12-month follow-up results. Clinical data were obtained from patient records.</p></sec><sec id="sec2874"><title>Results</title><p>At the 3-month follow-up, the median NLR with interquartile range was 1.34 (1.05-1.99) in the treatment retention group (n=112) and 1.72 (1.11-2.46) in the dropout/relapse group (n=88). At the 12-month follow-up, the median NLR with interquartile range was 1.28 (0.88-1.85) in the treatment retention group (n=52) and 1.56 (1.07-2.33) in the dropout/relapse group (n=148). The median NLR in the control group (n=78) was 1.36 (1.12-1.74). According to the 3-month and 12-month follow-up data, the difference between the groups concerning NLR was statistically significant (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>=9.072, p=0.011; &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>=11.165, p=0.004; respectively). Pairwise comparisons indicated that patients in the dropout/relapse group had significantly higher baseline NLR values than those in the treatment retention group and healthy controls according to the 3-month (p=0.038 and p=0.019, respectively) and 12-month follow-up data (p=0.012 and p=0.040, respectively). NLR did not differ significantly between the treatment retention and control groups in both follow-ups (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="sec2875"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings suggest that elevated baseline NLR is associated with dropout/relapse in OUD, indicating its potential as a marker for treatment follow-up in these patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2876"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
