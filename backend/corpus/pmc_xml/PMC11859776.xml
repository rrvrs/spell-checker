Regardless of the reasons for migration, the process itself can be a highly stressful life event, leading to a higher risk of psychiatric disorders. Refugees are particularly susceptible to mood and anxiety disorders, whose prevalence rates is almost twice as high as those found among non-refugee migrants.</p></sec><sec id="sec6806"><title>Objectives</title><p>Since 2022, with the progression of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the establishment of a real war scenario, many Ukrainians were forced to leave their homeland, to ensure their survival and security. In Europe, many countries took in Ukrainian refugees and Portugal was no exception.</p><p>In the Psychiatry Inpatient Service of University Hospital Center of S&#x000e3;o Jo&#x000e3;o, there were admissions of Ukrainian refugees who already had a known mental disease - at that time decompensated - and also new cases, to date without follow-up by the specialty.</p></sec><sec id="sec6807"><title>Methods</title><p>In this work, we will carry out a bibliographical review on the impact of war and migration on mental health and the potential of proper medical approach, based on articles indexed in Pubmed, in the last 10 years.</p><p>Furthermore, we will present the cases of war refugees interned in our service between January 2022 and December 2023.</p></sec><sec id="sec6808"><title>Results</title><p>We will describe the psychopathological features and also the sociofamilial circumstances of these patients, as well as explain the intervention and longitudinal support developed in these cases.</p></sec><sec id="sec6809"><title>Conclusions</title><p>As a conclusion, we point out the importance of approaching mental illness in light of the individual&#x02019;s context, knowing that this context may contain the problem and also the solution. War and forced migration bring increased challenges to psychiatry and, in an increasingly globalized society, geographical, linguistic or cultural barriers cannot impose limits on our best and most appropriate medical treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec6810"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
