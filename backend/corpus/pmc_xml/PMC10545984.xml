Patient reported outcome measures (PROM) provide an insight into the impact that an intervention or therapy has on the patient, this is particularly important when striving for improvements in maternity care. PROM&#x02019;s support real world clinical effectiveness assessment for different care models and interventions, describe variation across sociodemographic and clinical groups, highlight domains where there is greatest scope for improvement, and detect variation between providers and institutions that cannot be explained by differences in case mix. There are no current means of capturing outcomes from the perspective of women receiving maternity care. The need for patient-reported outcome measures that can be used in maternity care has been gaining attention in the literature over the past decade. The CROWN initiative, an international initiative led by research journal editors which was established to standardise core outcomes reporting in women&#x02019;s health research has been calling for supporting PROM sets to be developed in tandem to their core outcome sets, but currently no maternity PROM exist
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>PROM are a means of assessing the impact that health events, and interventions have had on constructs such as quality of life. It is important to differentiate PROM from patient-reported experience measures (PREMs). PREMs are assessments of the patients&#x02019; experience of the care they received including whether certain standards of care were met, and their subjective satisfaction with care. There are multiple maternity-specific PREMs in Ireland and the UK: the Irish national maternity experience survey
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> and two in the UK, the national maternity services survey
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup> and &#x02018;You and Your Baby&#x02019; survey
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>The ideal PROM should have validity, reliability and be able to measure change over time
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup>. Recent systematic reviews ascertained there are no PROM currently suitable for a maternity system, but many previously validated tools could be considered when designing a specific PROM for pregnancy and childbirth

</sup>. The development of a maternity PROM that covers antenatal, intra-partum, postpartum and neonatal care is challenging. There have been studies recently focusing on measures of recovery and recovery post Caesarean Section
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</sup>. This project will focus on the generation of a maternity PROM focusing on delivery outcomes which can be applied to all women postpartum. Postpartum quality of life (QoL) will be examined across multiple domains. This includes but is not limited to the conceptual model of patient outcomes by Wilson and Cleary
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup>; symptom status &#x02192; functional status &#x02192; general health perception &#x02192; overall QoL. This will allow new insights into women&#x02019;s perspectives of the healthcare they have received and ultimately driving the service into a more patient centred response.</p><p>The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments initiative has improved the selection and assessment of outcome measurement instruments. The COSMIN guidelines will allows us to select the best outcome measurements in a methodological and consistent way

<bold>Response 1</bold>:</p><p> Thank you, this systematic review aimed to both identify the tools available and to evaluate their psychometric properties. The objectives in the abstract read &#x02018;This systematic review aims to identify and evaluate existing patient reported assessment measures/tool(s) that can be used in developing a PROM for postpartum women.

<bold>Response 2: </bold>&#x000a0;The search strategy states &#x02018;A systematic literature review to examine all available objective tools for patient assessment of QoL and health assessment after hospital based maternity care will be performed using the following bibliographic databases:

<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ebsco.com/products/research-databases/cinahl-database" ext-link-type="uri">CINHAL</ext-link> and
<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.embase.com/" ext-link-type="uri">EMBASE</ext-link>. Databases will be searched from inception to present and there will be no language restrictions set. Additionally, hand searching of the reference lists of the studies included and key articles on this topic will be searched.&#x02019;</p><p> By searching these three databases we were hopeful that any articles on Cochrane or PsycInfo of relevance would be indexed in the above. This search strategy yields over 10,000 studies. Citation search will be included &#x02018;Additionally, hand searching of the reference lists of the studies included and key articles on this topic will be searched.&#x02019;</p><p>

The aim of the eligible study should be evaluation of one or more measurement properties of the tool, or the evaluation of the interpretability of the PROMs of interest. Studies that only use the PROM as a measurement instrument for the outcome of interest or in which the PROM was used for the validation of another instrument were excluded.

<bold>Response 7:</bold>&#x000a0;Thank you. The review will be conducted by subject matter experts, including obstetricians and gynaecologists actively involved in providing care at a tertiary-level maternity hospital and authors who have experience in designing and implementing PROM.

<bold>Response:</bold> Thank you, we increased the search strategy to include searching on the CINAHL database. The search, therefore, included three databases PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL which yielded 10,324 studies identified in the initial search, of which 29 tools were identified from 41 eligible studies included in the review. This has been added to the manuscript search strategy line 52 &#x02018;A systematic literature review to examine all available objective tools for patient assessment of QoL and health assessment after hospital-based maternity care will be performed using the following bibliographic databases: PubMed
<underline>, CINHAL</underline> and EMBASE.&#x02019;&#x000a0; The Abstract methods section has also been amended to include &#x02018;Methodological guidelines for systematic reviews of PROMs have been developed by the COSMIN initiative and will be followed for this systematic review. A systematic literature review will be performed using PubMed, CINAHL and EMBASE from inception to the present day.&#x02019;</p><p>

On the whole, the protocol seems appropriate and achievable. The rationale and objectives are clearly described, the proposed study design seems appropriate, and the proposed methods are described in detail.</p><p> There are however, a few typos and it would be good to be consistent in the use of the acronym PROM/S/s. Also, the 3 paragraphs under the headings 'Data extraction' and 'Generating recommendations for the use of a PROM', seem to be a direct repeat. Good luck with the review and I look forward to seeing the results.</p><p>Is the study design appropriate for the research question?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Is the rationale for, and objectives of, the study clearly described?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are sufficient details of the methods provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>Development of PROMs for use in maternity services in low and middle-income countries; Emergency obstetric care in LMIC; Care of mothers and newborns in LMIC.</p><p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p></body></sub-article></article>
