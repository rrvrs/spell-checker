AGEs, such as carboxymethyl lysine (CML), impair osteocyte function by activating the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), triggering oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. This study aimed to investigate the effects of high glucose (HG) and CML on bone remodeling, glycation, inflammatory markers, and cellular functions in osteocytes. Using the murine osteocyte cell line OCY454-12H, we treated cells with HG (30 mM glucose) or 3 &#x003bc;M CML to simulate diabetic conditions. We assessed the expression of bone remodeling markers (SOST, RANKL, OPG, CTsK), glycation markers (RAGE, AGER1), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic>), and cellular functions, including proliferation, viability, and apoptosis, using quantitative PCR and functional assays. HG treatment resulted in a 10-fold increase in SOST expression (9.3 vs. 0.9, p &#x02264; 0.0001) and a 2.4-fold increase in RANKL expression (2.75 vs. 1.15, p &#x02264; 0.0001), with a concurrent 2-fold increase in OPG (2.60 vs. 1.04, p &#x02264; 0.0001). The RANKL/OPG ratio remained unchanged (p = 0.15). HG also significantly increased RAGE expression by 3.67-fold (4.20 vs. 1.15, p &#x02264; 0.0001) and AGER1 by 1.65-fold (1.94 vs. 1.15, p &#x02264; 0.0001), along with a 2.02-fold increase in IL-6 (2.32 vs. 1.12, p &#x02264; 0.001) and a 7.35-fold increase in TNF-<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic> (7.04 vs. 1.04, p &#x02264; 0.0001). Cell viability and proliferation were significantly higher under HG, accompanied by increased caspase-3 activity, indicating enhanced apoptosis. In contrast, CML exposure significantly upregulated RAGE (3.18 vs. 1.15, p &#x02264; 0.0001) and AGER1 (2.10 vs. 1.14, p = 0.028) but had no significant effects on bone remodeling markers, inflammatory cytokines, or cellular functions at physiological concentrations. Our findings demonstrate that HG disrupts osteocyte function by altering bone remodeling, glycation, and inflammatory pathways, while CML at physiological levels selectively activates glycation markers without inducing broader cellular dysfunction. These results underscore the role of the AGE-RAGE axis in diabetic bone fragility and highlight the need for future <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> studies to explore therapeutic strategies targeting AGE accumulation and RAGE signaling in bone.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Osteocytes</kwd><kwd>Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)</kwd><kwd>Diabetes Mellitus</kwd><kwd>Bone Fragility</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Glycation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia, which has profound systemic consequences, including an increased risk of skeletal fragility [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite normal or even elevated bone mineral density observed in individuals with diabetes, their susceptibility to fractures is markedly increased, indicating compromised bone quality [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]-[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The bone mineral density discordant fracture prevalence is largely attributed to alterations in bone microarchitecture, reduced bone remodeling, and the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the bone matrix [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]-[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="P3">AGEs are formed through non-enzymatic glycation reactions driven by prolonged hyperglycemia [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Among the various AGEs, carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) is one of the most extensively studied, particularly in the context of diabetes. CML is commonly detected in tissues of individuals with diabetes and is associated with increased oxidative stress [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]-[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], reduced insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and impaired renal function [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Dietary modulation of CML has been shown to influence systemic health outcomes significantly, with diets low in CML associated with lower insulin resistance, visceral fat, and oxidative stress [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], whereas high-CML diets promote insulin resistance and inflammation [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], largely mediated through the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]-[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Given its significant impact on inflammation and metabolic regulation, CML has been investigated as a potential biomarker for diabetes-associated skeletal complications. However, further studies are needed to establish its clinical utility [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Recent evidence suggests that hyperglycemia may directly impact the extracellular matrix of the bone, particularly its composition and organization, ultimately weakening bone integrity [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is also well documented that CML and other AGEs can impair the biomechanical properties of the bone matrix, increasing its brittleness and susceptibility to fracture through non-enzymatic glycation of collagen and other structural proteins in the bone extracellular matrix [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]-[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Additionally, AGEs can bind to their specific receptor, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), triggering a cascade of signaling pathways that promote oxidative stress and inflammation [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In diabetes, the chronic activation of RAGE signaling in diabetes disrupts the balance of bone remodeling, by suppressing osteoblast-mediated bone formation and enhancing osteoclast-mediated bone resorption [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]-[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], further compromising bone integrity. Among bone cells, osteocytes are particularly vulnerable to AGE-RAGE interactions, as this signaling cascade impairs their regulatory function in maintaining skeletal homeostasis [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, cellular defense mechanisms exist to counteract AGE-induced damage, notably through the advanced glycation end product receptor 1 (AGER1), which promotes AGE detoxification and suppresses RAGE-mediated inflammatory responses [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Understanding the balance between RAGE activation and AGER1 expression is important to elucidating the molecular pathways contributing to diabetes-induced skeletal fragility.</p><p id="P5">Osteocytes, the most abundant and long-lived cells within the bone matrix [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], play a pivotal role in maintaining skeletal homeostasis [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These cells act as mechanosensors and orchestrate bone remodeling by regulating the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Osteocytes can promote bone resorption by expressing receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and cathepsin K (CTsK) [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], key molecules involved in osteoclast differentiation and function. Conversely, osteocytes inhibit bone formation by secreting sclerostin (SOST) [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], which has been found to be elevated in T2D patients [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]-[<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Osteocytes also secrete osteoprotegerin (OPG) [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]-[<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], a decoy receptor for RANKL, providing a mechanism to balance bone resorption and formation. Emerging evidence suggests that osteocytes are particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of AGEs and hyperglycemia [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] [<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]-[<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Unlike osteoblasts and osteoclasts, osteocytes are embedded within the mineralized matrix and have limited capacity for renewal, making them more susceptible to AGE accumulation over time. The accumulation of AGEs and activation of RAGE signaling in osteocytes may disrupt their function, contribute to impaired regulation of bone remodeling and alter the lacuno-canalicular network [<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. These disruptions could compromise bone quality by reducing bone turnover, increasing cortical porosity, and weakening bone microarchitecture, ultimately contributing to the increased fracture risk observed in diabetic patients. Thus, osteocyte dysfunction may play a crucial role in diabetic bone fragility by impairing the fine balance between bone resorption and formation, despite normal or elevated bone mineral density in T2D. However, the specific mechanisms through which hyperglycemia and CML influence osteocyte function are not well understood. Given that osteocytes are responsible for orchestrating bone remodeling in response to metabolic and mechanical signals, understanding their response to hyperglycemic conditions is crucial to elucidating the mechanisms underlying diabetes-related bone fragility. In addition to markers of bone remodeling, inflammation plays a key role in diabetes-related skeletal alterations. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic> (TNF-<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic>) are associated with T2D [<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] [<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and contribute to impaired bone turnover and increased bone resorption [<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] [<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. However, the regulation of these inflammatory markers in osteocytes under hyperglycemic conditions remains poorly understood.</p><p id="P6">To address these gaps, our study employed the OCY454-12H murine osteocyte cell line to simulate and examine the cellular responses to hyperglycemia and CML exposure.

This approach allowed for precise measurement of mRNA levels, providing insights into the transcriptional changes induced under diabetic conditions, which are critical for understanding the cellular pathways affected.

Cells were maintained on type I collagen-coated flasks (Corning, #356485) in alpha-MEM (Gibco, #12571) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Gibco, #26140) and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic 100X (Gibco, #15240) and 25mM HEPES (Sigma Aldrich, #H3375) to maintain pH. Cells were maintained in collagen-coated T-75 flasks or standard tissue culture flasks at 33&#x000b0;C, with media changes every 2 - 3 days. Cells were passaged every three days when reaching 90% confluence to prevent overgrowth, as over-confluence results in reduced SOST/sclerostin expression.</p><p id="P8">For experimental conditions, cells were plated at a density of 100,000 cells/mL in non-collagen-coated tissue culture plates. After three days, the media were replaced, and cultures were transferred to 37&#x000b0;C for osteocytic differentiation. The OCY454-12H cell line was specifically designed to differentiate into a mature osteocyte-like phenotype upon the inactivation of the temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen at 37&#x000b0;C. This temperature shift induces the transition from a proliferative state to a more mature osteocyte-like state, characterized by increased expression of osteocyte marker such as sclerostin. Media were subsequently changed every 2 - 3 days. Cells were maintained under these conditions for 10 - 12 days, which is the routine laboratory timepoint for achieving an osteocytic phenotype. SOST expression at this timepoint is typically between 28 - 32 Ct, with beta-actin as the reference gene at 16 - 18 Ct, as determined by RT-PCR (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2.</label><title>High Glucose Treatment (22 mM Glucose)</title><p id="P9">For the high glucose study, OCY454 cells were grown to confluence at 33&#x000b0;C (approximately 2 days) and subsequently plated in six-well plates (Corning, #3516) at a density of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL.

However, their responses to diabetic stressors, particularly hyperglycemia and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), remain poorly understood. In this study, we explored the impact of high glucose (HG) conditions and carboxymethyl lysine (CML), a prevalent AGE, on osteocyte-driven pathways associated with bone remodeling, glycation, and inflammation. Our findings reveal distinct effects of HG and CML exposure on osteocytes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms contributing to diabetes-induced skeletal fragility.</p><p id="P32">Our data indicate that HG conditions significantly upregulate key markers of bone turnover (SOST, RANKL, OPG), glycation (RAGE, AGER1), and inflammation (IL-6, TNF-<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic>), suggesting that hyperglycemia disrupts the balance between bone formation and resorption while promoting oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Elevated SOST expression under HG is consistent with previous studies demonstrating suppression of the Wnt/<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic>-catenin pathway in osteocytes in response to hyperglycemia [<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Additionally, increased RANKL and OPG expression without a significant change in the RANKL/OPG ratio may indicate a compensatory mechanism aimed at maintaining skeletal homeostasis under hyperglycemic stress [<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. This aligns with recent findings that hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress in human osteoblast cells simultaneously activates both resorptive and protective pathways [<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. While we did not assess potential glucose metabolism differences between treatment groups, future studies could explore whether osteocytes exhibit metabolic adaptations under prolonged hyperglycemic conditions, which could further influence their response to AGEs. The pronounced upregulation of RAGE and inflammatory markers further underscores the role of AGE-RAGE signaling in promoting oxidative stress and inflammation, which are key drivers of bone fragility in diabetes [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p id="P33">Interestingly, the effects of CML exposure differed significantly from those of HG. While CML treatment at physiological concentrations significantly upregulated glycation markers (RAGE and AGER1), it did not affect bone remodeling markers or inflammatory cytokines, nor did it alter cell viability or apoptosis. These results suggest that moderate CML levels primarily engage glycation pathways without triggering downstream inflammatory responses. This observation aligns with prior studies demonstrating that physiological levels of AGEs, including CML [<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]-[<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], can activate cellular signaling without necessarily inducing cytotoxic effects or inflammatory cascades [<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. For instance, CML has been shown to promote RAGE expression and oxidative stress responses in various cell types, including endothelial cells [<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and fibroblasts [<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. These effects often remain subclinical or non-inflammatory at lower concentrations [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] [<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Similarly, studies in osteoblasts have reported that AGE exposure enhances RAGE expression and disrupts cellular homeostasis without immediately triggering apoptosis or inflammation [<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] [<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. However, there is growing evidence that chronic or high-concentration AGE exposure leads to more pronounced cellular dysfunction, including increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of inflammatory pathways such as NF-<italic toggle="yes">&#x003ba;</italic>B [<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]-[<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. In osteocytes specifically, prolonged AGE exposure has been associated with impaired mechanosensing and altered bone remodeling activity, further exacerbating bone fragility in diabetic conditions [<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. This suggests that while transient or moderate CML exposure may primarily engage glycation pathways, sustained exposure could lead to progressive oxidative damage and inflammatory responses. Long-term exposure to CML may lead to persistent alterations in osteocyte signaling, increasing apoptosis, impairing the lacuno-canalicular network, and further dysregulating bone remodeling by continuously altering RANKL, OPG, and SOST expression. Additionally, prolonged AGE-RAGE signaling is likely to sustain pro-inflammatory cytokine production, such as IL-6 and TNF-<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic>, which may contribute to low-grade chronic inflammation and further compromise bone quality. While our current study does not assess these long-term effects, we acknowledge the importance of future investigations that extend the exposure period to determine whether chronic CML treatment could lead to progressive deterioration of osteocyte function and bone integrity. Our findings indicate a threshold effect for CML&#x02019;s impact on osteocyte function, supporting the need for further research into dose-response dynamics, particularly in the context of chronic diabetic hyperglycemia where AGE accumulation is persistent. A systematic dose-response study would help determine whether higher AGE concentrations or prolonged exposure elicit a threshold-dependent activation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, leading to progressive osteocyte dysfunction and compromised bone integrity.</p><p id="P34">A key limitation of our study is the use of the murine osteocyte cell line OCY454-12H to model diabetic bone pathology. The OCY454-12H cell line was used for this study due to its well characterized mature osteocyte like phenotype, including high Sclerostin expression which is not observed in other osteocyte like cell lines such as MLO-Y4 or IDG-SW3. Although cell lines provide a controlled environment to study molecular pathways, they cannot fully replicate the complexity of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> bone tissue. <italic toggle="yes">In vivo</italic>, osteocytes are embedded within the mineralized matrix and are subject to mechanical loading and systemic factors, such as hormones and immune cells, influencing their behavior. Therefore, the findings from cell culture studies may not fully reflect the cellular responses in bone tissue under physiological or pathological conditions. Another limitation is that we focused on gene expression analysis rather than protein levels or functional outcomes, which means our findings are based on transcriptional changes and may not fully represent the actual protein expression or post-translational modifications that occur in response to hyperglycemia and CML exposure. This limitation is particularly relevant when interpreting the effects of CML, as protein modifications, such as AGE formation and RAGE activation, could have downstream consequences on protein function, cellular signaling, and osteocyte behavior. Additionally, assessing functional outcomes such as osteocyte apoptosis, lacunar area changes, or bone matrix mineralization under AGE exposure would strengthen the link between molecular alterations and skeletal fragility. Future studies should aim to complement these gene expression data with protein analysis and functional outcomes to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how hyperglycemia and AGEs, such as CML, influence osteocyte function at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels.</p><p id="P35">Despite these limitations, cell lines remain a valuable tool for investigating cellular responses to specific stimuli, such as hyperglycemia and AGEs, under highly controlled conditions. They allow for precise manipulation of experimental variables, enabling the dissection of molecular mechanisms that would be difficult to isolate <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. Moreover, the OCY454-12H cell line represents a mature osteocyte phenotype, making it particularly relevant for studying the long-term effects of diabetic conditions on osteocytes, which are the longest-lived bone cells. The use of osteocyte cell lines provides important mechanistic insights into how hyperglycemia and AGEs influence osteocyte function at the molecular level. Our study highlights the potential for targeting the AGE-RAGE axis and oxidative stress pathways as therapeutic strategies to mitigate diabetic bone fragility. The upregulation of SOST under HG conditions suggests that targeting sclerostin, a known inhibitor of bone formation, may help counteract the suppressive effects of hyperglycemia on bone formation. Additionally, the observed increase in both proliferation and caspase-3 activity in HG-treated cells indicates a dual cellular response involving both adaptive and apoptotic mechanisms, which warrants further investigation. Future studies should focus on validating these findings in <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> models to assess the long-term impact of hyperglycemia and AGEs on bone quality and remodeling. Animal models of diabetes would provide critical insights into how chronic hyperglycemia and AGE accumulation affect bone turnover, microarchitecture, and fracture risk over time. Additionally, studies should explore the interaction between different types of AGEs and their cumulative impact on bone tissue, as well as the potential for synergistic effects of HG and AGEs in driving osteocyte dysfunction.</p><p id="P36">Our findings also raise important questions about the threshold levels of AGEs required to trigger inflammatory and apoptotic responses in osteocytes. Investigating dose-dependent effects of AGEs, including CML, will be critical to understanding how varying glycation burdens influence bone health in diabetic patients. Furthermore, the role of AGER1 as a protective mechanism against AGE-induced damage warrants further exploration. Enhancing AGER1 expression or function may offer a promising therapeutic strategy to counteract the deleterious effects of AGEs on bone cells.</p><p id="P37">In conclusion, while the use of osteocyte cell lines presents inherent limitations, our study provides valuable insights into the molecular responses of osteocytes to hyperglycemic and AGE stressors. The distinct effects of HG and CML on glycation, inflammation, and bone remodeling markers highlight the complexity of diabetic bone disease. Future research should prioritize <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> studies to validate these findings and investigate potential interventions targeting the AGE-RAGE axis and oxidative stress pathways to mitigate bone fragility in diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P38">We thank the MGH Center for Skeletal Research P30 Core (P30AR066261) for providing the cells and Dr. Paola Divieti Pajevic for training in best practices for Ocy454 cell culture.
