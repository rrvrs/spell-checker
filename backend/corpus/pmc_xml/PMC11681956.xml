India has more than 115 million CKD patients, according to the Global Burden of Disease Study (2017) [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The progression of CKD is usually slow; however, when the patient reaches the most advanced stage of illness, that is, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), kidney function is damaged to the extent that the patient needs renal replacement therapy (RRT), an artificial process used to remove water, electrolytes, and waste substances from the blood. Hemodialysis (HD) is the most used RRT in India&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Insulin resistance (IR) and oxidative stress (OS) are common in patients undergoing chronic HD (CHD) and are associated with excess mortality. The etiology of IR and OS in the CHD population is complex and multifactorial. Some of the proposed determinants of IR and OS in CHD patients include chronic inflammation, excess visceral fat, adipokine deregulation and accumulation, metabolic acidosis, OS, vitamin D deficiency, anemia, decreased physical activity, and accumulation of uremic toxins&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Loss of vitamins during HD procedure, reduced selenium levels, and reduced function of the glutathione (GSH) scavenging mechanism can further deteriorate OS in HD&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are aliphatic carboxylic acids of low carbon number (C2-C6) produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber or via protein catabolism, with acetate (C2), propionate (C3), and butyrate (C4) as the main contributors to total SCFA content&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. SCFAs regulate blood pressure and metabolism by activating G protein-coupled receptors and inhibiting histone acetylation&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Probiotics are defined as &#x0201c;live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host&#x0201d;&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although relatively new, the beneficial effects of certain foods containing live bacteria have been recognized for centuries. They are available as capsules, tablets, packets, or powders and are contained in various fermented foods, most commonly in yogurt or dairy drinks. Probiotic products may contain a single microorganism or a mixture of several species&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The most widely used probiotics include lactic acid bacteria, specifically&#x000a0;<italic>Lactobacillus</italic>&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;<italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>&#x000a0;species.&#x000a0;<italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic>&#x000a0;also appears to have health benefits&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p><italic>Lactobacillus</italic>&#x000a0;(<italic>L.</italic>) spp.,&#x000a0;<italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>&#x000a0;(<italic>B.</italic>) spp.,&#x000a0;<italic>Streptococcus</italic>&#x000a0;spp.,&#x000a0;<italic>Enterococcus</italic>&#x000a0;spp., and&#x000a0;<italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic>&#x000a0;are the most administered probiotic strains for supplementation&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. By maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier function, competing with pathogens for nutrients, and regulating the host immune response, probiotics can improve host metabolism, relieve uremic toxicity, reduce pro-inflammatory factor levels, and delay the progression of renal injury in CKD patients&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between gut microbiome and advanced CKD stages. Studies have shown significant diversity in the composition of gut bacteria in patients with advanced CKD and healthy individuals&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This suggests that the microbiota composition may be altered during HD treatment, leading to a shift toward more pathogenic bacteria&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>There are no interventional studies targeted at improving IR in Indian HD patients. The beneficial effects of probiotic supplementation on glycemic control, lipid levels, and biomarkers of OS among non-HD patients have been previously reported&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The discovery of the gut-kidney axis has created new therapeutic opportunities for a nutritional intervention involving dietary protein, fiber, prebiotic (fibers that are non-digestible food ingredients and beneficially affect the host&#x02019;s health by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of some genera of microorganisms in the colon), probiotic, and synbiotics (combination of prebiotic and probiotic). It has also been reported that the pharmacobiotic potential of the gut microbiota may provide a plausible therapeutic avenue for the administration of live multistrain probiotic cultures.</p><p>Following the recent evidence from various animal and human studies of probiotic supplementation in improving antioxidant mechanisms&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which in turn maintains glucose homeostasis by decreasing IR, this study aims to investigate the effect of multistrain probiotic (<italic>Lactobacilli</italic>,&#x000a0;<italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>,&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;<italic>Bacillus</italic>) supplementation on IR, lipid levels, and biomarkers of OS in the management of diabetic patients with ESRD on maintenance HD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) and registered in the Clinical Trials Registry, India (CTRI/2021/11/038044). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines issued by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, the Ministry of Health, and the Government of India. Before each participant was enrolled in the study, a thorough explanation of the study's objective was given, and they voluntarily provided signed informed consent.</p><p>Methodology</p><p>This was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving ESRD diabetic patients undergoing HD attending the dialysis unit of the Nephrology Department. Subjects aged 35-65 years of either sex, having type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for at least five years, who were on stable antidiabetic medication for at least three months prior to the start of the study, with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values in the range of 7%-10% and a homeostatic model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR) value &#x0003e; 4, and with ESRD who were undergoing HD thrice weekly for at least three months prior to the start of the study were included in the study. Pregnant and lactating women, subjects with active gastrointestinal diseases (inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome), subjects who are taking probiotics or have taken probiotics within the last month prior to the start of the study, subjects who were taking antioxidants and/or anti-inflammatory supplements (vitamin E, vitamin C, or omega-3 fatty acids), and subjects who were taking immunosuppressive medication within three months before enrollment in the study were excluded.</p><p>Subjects were screened for eligibility during the screening visit, and eligible subjects were randomly assigned to the intervention groups based on a computer-generated randomization list in the allocation ratio of 1:1. The pharmacist supervised treatment concealment. For every randomization number, there was a sealed envelope containing the details of the study medications. All these details were kept confidential and under the custody of the pharmacist. Both the investigator and the subjects were blinded to the treatment allocation. The subjects were assigned to either group A or group B.</p><p>Group A received UB0316 capsules, which contained&#x000a0;<italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic>&#x000a0;UBLS-22 (five billion colony-forming units (CFU)),&#x000a0;<italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic>&#x000a0;UBLC-42 (five billion CFU),&#x000a0;<italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic>&#x000a0;UBLP-40 (five billion CFU),&#x000a0;<italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>&#x000a0;UBLA-34 (five billion CFU),&#x000a0;<italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic>&#x000a0;UBBr-01 (five billion CFU),&#x000a0;<italic>Bacillus coagulans</italic>&#x000a0;Unique IS-2 (five billion CFU), and fructooligosaccharide 100 mg. Subjects assigned to group B received a matching placebo, i.e., similar in appearance to probiotic capsules and dispensed in similar containers as probiotics to maintain blinding.</p><p>Subjects were instructed to take the study medications once daily 30 min before the afternoon meal for 12 weeks. Follow-up visits were at four, eight, and 12 weeks for assessment of general well-being as well as adverse events and checking compliance to medications using the pill count method. Final measurements and assessments were performed at the end of the treatment period. The safety and tolerability of subjects were monitored throughout the study.</p><p>The primary outcome measures include HOMA-IR and the OS markers, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and GSH. HOMA-IR is a calculated parameter derived from serum fasting insulin and serum fasting plasma glucose, calculated as given below:</p><p>HOMA-IR = [fasting insulin (&#x000b5;IU/mL)] &#x000d7; [fasting glucose (mg/dL)]/405&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The secondary outcome measures were glycemic control parameters (fasting blood sugar (FBS), HbA1c, and serum fasting insulin) and lipid profile (total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C)). Safety assessment was based on the incidence and severity of adverse events in both groups.</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>The sample size was calculated based on a study conducted by Soleimani et al.&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A sample size of 50 subjects was found to be sufficient to detect a mean difference of 2.6 with a standard deviation (SD) of 3.3 in HOMA-IR, considering a dropout rate of 15% and a screen failure rate of 10%. A total of 62 subjects were needed for the study. The power of the study was 80%. Type I error was set at 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.3.1 (Insight Venture Management, LLC, New York, NY, US) and Microsoft Office 365 Excel version 2303 (Build 16227.20280) (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, US). All subjects who completed 12 weeks of treatment were considered for efficacy analysis. Data are presented as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation for normally distributed data. Comparisons within the group at various time points were performed using a paired t-test. Comparisons between groups were performed using an unpaired t-test. Data from the interrupted patients was not included in the efficacy analysis. All subjects who were randomized in the study were considered for safety analysis. Safety data were expressed as proportions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Sixty-two participants were initially screened; however, only 50 met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study.

The results were verified through sensitivity analysis, which confirmed the reliability and stability of the findings.</p><p>The medications used in this study were well tolerated. No serious adverse events were reported. Mild gastrointestinal adverse effects were observed in this study. None of the subjects discontinued the study owing to adverse events, which suggests a good safety profile of the probiotic used in this study.

The current study assessed the outcomes for a short duration (12 weeks); studies to assess the long-term benefits of probiotics in this population would be helpful in establishing a potential clinical benefit and determining the long-term safety of probiotics. Another limitation is we did not assess direct dynamic measures like the hyperinsulinemic clamp or the glucose tolerance test. Consequently, this needs to be considered while interpreting our results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study indicated that probiotic supplementation for 12 weeks among diabetic ESRD patients on maintenance HD had beneficial effects on the parameters of glucose homeostasis and biomarkers of OS and was well tolerated. According to our study, probiotic supplementation may be an important and beneficial therapeutic approach for diabetic patients undergoing HD and can be recommended as an adjuvant to the standard of care. However, long-term studies are advised to confirm the positive clinical benefits of probiotic supplementation in patients undergoing HD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors express their sincere gratitude to Unique Biotech Limited, Hyderabad, for their generous contribution of UB0316 capsules (probiotic) and matching placebo for this study.
