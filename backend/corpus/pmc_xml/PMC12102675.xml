DENV-1 infection was associated with manifest clinical diseases from mild to severe, and increased mortality related to organ involvement (J&#x000e1;come <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021) A disturbance in the control of Dengue virus (DENV) and the mechanisms that regulate cytokine production can increase the viral load accompanied by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in severe Dengue disease. Up to now, there are no commercially available antiviral drugs to treat DENV infection, and treatment remains supportive (Obi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). DENV vaccines have recently been used in some countries, its indication is limited due to the risk of severe Dengue in certain populations and the decline in efficacy during the second year in 4&#x02013;16-year-olds in dengue-endemic countries (L&#x000f3;pez-Medina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). <italic>In vitro</italic>, cell line-based assays were needed to screen vaccines and antiviral activity against DENV (Panda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021; Tsypysheva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021).</p><p>The replication of DENV depends on the susceptibility of the cell and the characteristics of its innate immune response (Charretier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018; Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018; Haryanto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019). DENV-1 has the highest viral growth among all serotypes (Sasmono <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015). Appropriate cell models are essential to advance research into the molecular basis of the disease, which can be applied to studies of drug metabolism, hepatotoxicity, and even viral infections. Non-human (Vero cells) and Human hepatoma (Hep G2 cells and Huh-7 cells) are suitable for determining susceptibility to DENV infection (Chan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016). Vero cells, HepG2 cells, and Huh-7 cells are readily available and easy to maintain, and they are commonly used for DENV replication, NS1 secretion, and immune responses (Kongmanas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020).</p><p>DENV manipulates the host cell machinery to facilitate its replication during infection. DENV infects the host cell to release three structural proteins such as envelope (E), membrane (M), and capsid (C)) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5). It is known that the E protein is the molecule that binds to receptors on the host cell membrane and is also a major antigen, which can induce neutralizing antibody and host-specific protective immunity (Chin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007). The receptors used by DENV may differ very much, depending on cell types and viral serotypes (Sakoonwatanyoo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and Heparan sulfate are major DENV receptors in the liver cells that play a role in the initial DENV binding of HepG2 cells, and Huh 7 cells (Fang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013; Kongmanas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020).</p><p>The expression levels of those receptors on HepG2 cells might be different from those of Huh-7. Furthermore, DENV replication in HepG2 cells was promoted by miR-21 (Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016). Besides E protein, Non-structural proteins play an important role in virus adaptation to cultured cells. RACK1 is a host factor in HepG2 and Huh7 cells that interacts with the DENV-1 NS1 protein (Shue <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). The efficiency of viral replication in cells depends on the differential cell susceptibility. Releasing DENV from host alternation facilitates adaptation. A fitness increase in one host usually diminishes fitness in another. Viruses allowed to specialize in single host cells exhibited fitness gains, which affects the replication of the virus. DENV fitness can be influenced by the cell lines it passes through. The virus was inoculated into two cell lines alternately, showing increased DENV fitness in both cell lines. Comparison of fitness and the general pattern of DENV-1 adaptation in differential cell lines affecting the efficiency of viral propagation (Vasilakis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009; Scroggs <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021).</p><p>This study aims to compare the effectiveness of DENV-1 replication in different cell lines, human hepatocytes (Huh-7, HepG2), and non-human kidney cells (Vero). We used DENV-1 isolated from patients that were propagated in 2 cell lines (Huh-7 cell and Vero cell) with no significant difference in their titer.</p><p>The effectiveness of virus replication was measured based on the virus titer obtained from DENV-1 infected Huh-7, HepG2, and Vero with various multiplicity of infection (MOI) starting from 2 FFU/cell up to 0.03125 FFU/cell. Viral titration was based on the formation of foci on cells stained by indirect immuno-peroxidase staining with 3,3&#x02019;-Diaminobenzidine (DAB). The result of this study is the basis for selecting suitable adapted DENV and cell lines for further studies such as the pathogenesis of DHF, diagnostic kit, antiviral drugs, and vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Viral isolates and cell culture</title><p>We used Dengue Virus Serotype1 strain IDS 11/2010 which was isolated from patients, and propagated in Vero cells and Huh7 cells, as working stocks of the viruses.

DENV enters the human body through mosquito bites, penetrating the keratocyte layer and capillary network. Autopsies of human tissue from dengue fever patients showed that DENV replication affected the lymph nodes, spleen, alveolar macrophages in the lungs, and perivascular cells in the brain (Balsitis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009). Studies conducted on Dengue Fever (DF) patients revealed that various types of cells such as monocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), and endothelial cells can be infected with DENV (Durbin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008). This is related to the severity of the disease (Durbin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008). <italic>In vitro</italic>, many primary human cell types, including epithelial, endothelial (Dewi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008), and fibroblasts have been shown to support viral replication (Marianneau <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996) Currently, various cell lines are widely used for the propagation of viral strains, antiviral studies, diagnostic tests, virus receptors, and replication studies using laboratory-adapted dengue virus strains. Low passages and genotypes from different geographic areas, marked variation in the susceptibility to infection among cell types (Schneider-Schaulies <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000) DENV infection in peripheral blood monocytes, U937 myeloid cells, and THP-1, result in increased antibodies (Diamond <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000). This study compared the replication effectiveness of DENV-1 isolated from DF patients in Indonesia in Human hepatocytes (Huh-7, HepG2) and non-human kidney cells (Vero). We used DENV-1-adapted Huh-7 cells and DENV-1-adapted Vero cells. Previous studies identified non-specific receptor molecules such as glycosaminoglycans and heparan sulfate, which function in DENV attachment to several cell lines (Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997). Heparan sulfate consists of alternating hexuronic acid/D-glucosamine disaccharides, with different degrees and patterns of sulfation. This compound is expressed in almost all cell types and can form linear chains of varying structural complexity and length (Coombe and Kett, 2005). A principal role of the dengue virus envelope protein in the initial binding to target cells, especially the domain III, and detects amino acids 284-310 and amino acids 386-411 which are two potential heparan sulfate binding motifs in this domain (Coombe and Kett, 2005)</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies show the involvement of the liver during dengue virus infections (Couvelard <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999) and the presence of the Dengue virus in hepatocytes and/or Kupffer cells (Huerre <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001). In the hepatocyte cell line, several stress-related proteins have been implicated as dengue virus receptors in various cell types, such as the GRP78 protein expressed in liver cells, and the HSP 90/70 protein in monocytes and macrophages (Jindadamrongwech and Smith, 2004). However, antibodies directed against hsp70 and hsp90 showed no inhibition of any Dengue serotype. The HSP 90/70 protein complex does not play a role in the internalization of the Dengue virus into liver cells, while the GRP78 protein is a Dengue virus receptor protein. This was confirmed by the presence of antibodies against GRP78 in the process of moderate inhibition of the entry of Dengue virus into liver cells (Cabrera-Hernandez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007). We found DENV-1-positive infected cells (brown foci) in Huh-7 cells and Vero cells but not in Hep G2 cells. Previous studies showed that All four DENV serotypes can be propagated in HepG2 cells. Mature virus for serotype DENV-4 is produced within 12 hours, and for other serotypes is made at 17-18 hours (Thepparit <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004). However, pretreatment with the addition of trypsin or heparinase III to HepG2 cell cultures can cause a decrease in virus production, with the smallest effect on serotype DENV-3 (Thepparit <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004). Pretreating HepG2 with trypsin might reduce the ability of DENV-1 to infect HepG2 in this study.</p><p>Recent studies have focused on the entry of the DENV into HepG2 cells, identifying potential receptors or factors crucial to this process. The study identified the 37-kDa/67-kDa laminin receptor as a DENV-1 receptor in HepG2 cells, demonstrating its role in virus entry, with reduced binding observed after pre-incubation with soluble laminin and an antibody against GRP78 (Ng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). Another study investigated the mechanism of Dengue virus internalization into HepG2 cells and found that the entry was independent of hsp90 and hsp70, which are heat shock proteins that have been implicated in the entry of DENV into other cell types (Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). Furthermore, in a study, the simian kidney cell line Vero had higher susceptibility to DENV-1 than the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. This means that the infectivity and binding affinity of DENV-1 is higher in Vero cells than in HepG2 cells. The study suggested the involvement of different receptors or receptors presented in a different conformation in the two cell types.(Thepparit <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013). Therefore, in this receptor mechanism, there may be differences in the receptors or their conformation between HepG2 and Vero cells.</p><p>DENV uses heparan sulfate (HS) on the surface of Vero cells as a receptor (Kongmanas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). Vero cells are highly susceptible to dengue virus infection, and they contain large amounts of heparan sulfate (HS) on their surfaces, which serve as receptors for the virus1. In addition to HS, other molecules have been identified as putative Dengue virus receptors on Vero cells, such as a 74-kDa protein and glycoproteins of 40 and 45 kDa. The 74-kDa protein has been suggested to be part of a putative receptor complex for Dengue virus in Vero cells (Rabelo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017). The entry of Dengue virus into Vero cells involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which plays a role in the outcome of infections. The DENV-3 infective entry pathway used varies depending on the host cell. The influence of the clathrin pathway on DENV-3 entry has been evaluated in other mammalian cell lines, such as HepG2, U937, and A549 cells.</p><p>Infectious and non-infectious pathways experience simultaneous coexistence depending on the usage of clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been demonstrated for the first time in Vero cells2 (Carpp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). In addition to Vero cells, other cell lines like iPS-ML and iPS-DC have been studied for their susceptibility to DENV infection. Vero cells, K562, iPS-DC, and iPS-ML, are susceptible to DENV infection. The highest infective yield titer was observed in Vero cells (Bol&#x000ed;var-Marin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). Huh-7 cells are susceptible to infection by all four Dengue virus serotypes, with research identifying a putative receptor for DENV-1 on these cells (Zandi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012). Additionally, a proteomic analysis of Huh-7 cells infected with DENV-2 revealed significant alterations in the expression of host cell proteins, providing insights into the interactions between the virus and the host cell (Bol&#x000ed;var-Marin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). The exact nature of the receptor on Huh-7 cells that mediates DENV entry has not been fully elucidated. However, the susceptibility of Huh-7 cells to infection by all four dengue virus serotypes suggests that they may express a receptor or receptors that are broadly recognized by the virus. DENV-1-adapted in Huh-7 cells and Vero cells can efficiently replicate in Huh-7 and Vero cells up to the MOI 0,03125 FFU/cell. In comparison with Huh7, the number of foci in Vero cells were more profound in both DENV-1-derived Huh-7 and Vero cells. DENV can manipulate the host cell&#x02019;s machinery to facilitate its replication.</p><p>The processes that occur during DENV infection have potential in the study of the pathogenesis, vaccine, diagnostic, and therapeutic agents (Suttitheptumrong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013). In the absence of an animal model, there had been hampering difficulties associated with studies of Dengue virus infection of the human liver, an appropriate hepatocyte model is essential to conduct this study. Huh7 and HepG2 cells are human hepatoma cell lines, which can be used as liver cell models. These cells are readily available and easy to maintain (Haryanto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019; J&#x000e1;come <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). However, such carcinoma-derived cell lines have genetic and characteristic limitations. The hepatic model can be applied to studies of drug metabolism, hepatotoxicity, and even viral infections. Heparan sulfate has previously been shown to be a major DENV receptor in human liver cells (Guti&#x000e9;rrez-Barbosa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). With the limitation of Huh7 cell lines, we found that Huh7 can be infected with DENV-1 from DF patients in Indonesia-derived Huh-7 and Vero cells. Our findings revealed that efficiently replicating DENV is influenced by the type of cell lines used for propagation associated with the receptors present in the cell.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study demonstrated that Dengue Virus Serotype 1 (DENV-1), particularly the MOI 0,03125 (FFU/cell), exhibits different replication efficiencies in various cell lines. The virus adapted to both Huh-7 and Vero cells showed the highest replication efficiency in Vero cells, with significant viral titers observed. Among human hepatocyte cell lines, DENV-1 replicated more effectively in Huh-7 cells compared to HepG2 cells. This suggests that Vero cells and Huh-7 cells are more conducive environments for DENV-1 replication than HepG2 cells, which did not exhibit foci formation after 48 hours of infection. These findings are crucial for optimizing laboratory diagnostics and developing antiviral strategies and vaccines targeting DENV-1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="sec1-6"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest associated with this study.</p><def-list><title>List of Abbreviations:</title><def-item><term>DENV-1-</term><def><p>Dengue Virus Serotype 1;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HepG2-</term><def><p>Hepatocellular Carcinoma, G2;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Huh-7-</term><def><p>Human Hepatoma-7;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Vero-</term><def><p>Vervet Monkey Kidney;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOI-</term><def><p>Multiplicity of Infection;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFU-</term><def><p>Focus-Forming Units.</p></def></def-item></def-list></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by the Universitas Indonesia&#x02019;s Directorate of Research and Development under the Postgraduate International Indexed Publication Grant (Grant number: NKB-109/UN2.RST/HKP.05.00/2023).
