It comprises a group of heterogeneous diseases that can be classified into binary phenotypes based on the presence (chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, CRSwNP) or absence (chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, CRSsNP) of nasal polyps (NPs) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Fokkens et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Staphylococcus aureus S. aureus</italic>is one of the most common pathogens in CRS (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Liang et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). Nasal carriage of <italic>S. aureus</italic> occurs in up to 70% of patients with CRSwNP. <italic>S. aureus</italic> colonization of the upper airways appears to be a significant external trigger in the pathogenesis of CRS. It may exhibit a series of mechanisms to invade the immune system, including the secretion of enterotoxins that impact the ciliary structure and function, the formation of biofilms to isolate the pathogens from immunocytes, and the production of virulence factors that target the epithelial barrier (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Foreman et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Jervis-Bardy et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Thammavongsa et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) is associated with recalcitrant disease, antibiotic tolerance, and poor postoperative outcomes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Al-Asousi et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). However, the mechanism of action of MRSA in the disease remains to be elucidated.</p><p>The nasal mucosal epithelium collaborates with neutrophils against microbial invasion, acting as the physical barrier of the first-line defense. Numerous studies have shown the importance of epithelial barrier function in CRS and other airway diseases (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Barham et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Hellings and Steelant, 2020</xref>). Dysregulation of the sinus epithelium could lead to a series of morphological changes, including mucociliary dysfunction, mucus overproduction, and disrupted maintenance of the air&#x02013;liquid surface and ion transport (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Schleimer et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the epithelial integrity, which is maintained by intercellular protein complexes called &#x0201c;tight junctions&#x0201d; (TJs), is undermined (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Pothoven et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). TJs are composed of transmembrane proteins including claudin, occludin, junctional adhesion molecules, and intracellular scaffolding proteins anchored to the actin cytoskeleton, such as zonula occludens (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Balda and Matter, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Sturgeon and Fasano, 2016</xref>). These protein complexes regulate the epithelial impermeability against pathogens and foreign particles, ions, and certain molecules through the paracellular space (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jang et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). In the context of the nasal epithelium, TJ proteins are downregulated in mature polyps, resulting in barrier dysfunction and the entry of pathogens (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Nur et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the role of the physical barrier against microbes, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced at the epithelial surfaces have recently been identified as important factors that enhance the barrier function (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chung and Khanum, 2017</xref>). Human defensins comprise one of the major AMPs, classified into alpha-defensins (human neutrophil peptides, hNPs) and beta-defensins (hBDs) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Luo and Song, 2021</xref>). They are a group of cationic polypeptide molecules that were originally reported to exert antimicrobial activity and regulation of the microbiota composition (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Supp et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). These hBDs can be expressed either constitutively or induced in various tissues and cell types in response to microbial challenge and the production of inflammatory mediators (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Recently, it has become evident that hBDs are associated with the initiation and development of various inflammatory disorders and diseases (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fusco et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kiatsurayanon et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Among them, human &#x003b2;-defensin 2 (hBD-2) have recently been reported to enhance the skin integrity by increasing the expression of TJ proteins and the transepithelial electrical resistance (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the hBD-2 secreted by intestinal epithelial cells was found to reduce the invasive ability of <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, in addition to upregulating the expression of TJs upon infection (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fusco et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Despite the great involvement of the microbiota, particularly <italic>S. aureus</italic>, in CRS and its potential effect on barrier dysfunction, the role and the mechanism of hBD-2 in regulating the epithelial barrier function (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Sedaghat et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>) in CRS have not yet been investigated. We hypothesize that hBD-2 might protect the human nasal epithelial layer upon <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion by upregulating the expression of TJs and by downregulating the invasive ability of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in CRS. The results should enable us to better understand the mechanisms by which hBD-2 exerts its antimicrobial function in the sinonasal environment during infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Subjects</title><p>NP tissues were obtained from patients with CRSwNP who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery.

While hBD-2 itself is not a canonical neutrophil chemoattractant, the interaction between hBD-2 and TLR4 triggers the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, driving downstream cytokine production, which can drive neutrophil chemotaxis and immune cell recruitment (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Steubesand et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). These coordinated actions highlight the pivotal role of hBD-2 in bridging the innate defense mechanisms with adaptive immune activation.</p><p>Hence, the impact of hBD2 on the growth curve of <italic>S. aureus</italic> was also preliminarily explored. It was found that hBD-2 inhibited the growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and that the different concentrations caused growth delay. Several human defensins have been reported to induce inhibition of growth or the killing of various bacteria and fungi (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cobo and Chadee, 2013</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the activity of hBD-2 against <italic>S. aureus.</italic> As an antimicrobial mechanism, defensins disrupted the membrane permeability at concentrations that correlated with the inhibition of growth. Overall, this result further demonstrates the antimicrobial effect of hBD-2 against <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection.</p><p>Upon <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion, hBD-2 reduced its invasiveness, assessed as adhesion and internalization and its ability to cross the HNECs. The invasion assays on HNECs demonstrated that hBD-2 not only markedly inhibited the internalization of <italic>S. aureus</italic> but also impeded its penetration through the monolayer. These effects could have resulted from the reinforcement of the barrier integrity, as evidenced by the increased dextran flux and the decreased TEER values. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining of TJs directly showed that treatment with hBD-2 reversed the effect of the <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced epithelial barrier function disruption through the upregulation of the TJ proteins. However, this reversible effect was not sufficient to recover the mucosal epithelium. There are two possible reasons for this. The concentration of hBD-2 was determined as 50 ng/ml in the invasion assay to ensure the growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which in turn might have decreased the protective effect of the epithelial barrier function. In summary, hBD-2 treatment of HNECs partially reversed the epithelial barrier dysfunction, suggesting the protective effect of hBD-2 on <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. However, this reversible effect was not sufficient to recover the mucosal epithelium.</p><p>Notably, our group demonstrated an impaired TJ barrier and a decreased TJ protein expression in patients with CRSwNP. A compromised epithelial barrier integrity within the sinonasal mucosa is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP. This impaired barrier function facilitates microbial colonization and contributes to the development and persistence of chronic inflammation. Therefore, future studies should take into account the dose effect of hBD-2 and the potential contributions of other hBDs in CRS.</p><p>This study has several limitations. One of the major limitations is that, given the limited number of studies investigating the correlation between hBDs and CRS, further research is warranted to elucidate the precise role of hBDs in the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic implications of each CRS phenotype. Another limitation is that this study preliminarily demonstrated that hBD-2 abrogates the <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced epithelial barrier function disruption; however, further <italic>in vivo</italic>/<italic>in vitro</italic> knockout studies were not carried out to identify the signaling pathways.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="SF1" ref-type="supplementary-material">
