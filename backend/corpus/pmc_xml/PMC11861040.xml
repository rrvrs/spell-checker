In this scenario, the emotional regulation (ER) of each partner plays a central role and serves a protective factor, configuring as an area to intervene. The Connect Parent Group, an attachment-based intervention for parents, has shown evidence of effectiveness. However, its online version (e-Connect) has not yet garnered specific evidence related to emotional and physiological regulation in parents and preadolescents.</p></sec><sec id="sec1213"><title>Objectives</title><p>This study aimed to explore changes in the short and medium term regarding ER abilities - both self-reported and measured through physiological indices - in parents and preadolescents with behavioral disorders, building upon initial findings from an online parenting intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec1214"><title>Methods</title><p>28 parents (82.1% mothers, 17.9% fathers, M_age = 47.48, SD = 4.73) and their 28 preadolescents with behavioral disorders (M_age = 11.22 years, SD = 2.69, 35.7% girls) were recruited from child neuropsychiatry services in Northern Italy and subsequently took part in the pilot study. They were assessed at three time points: before intervention (T1), one months after the intervention (T2) and at 6-months follow-up (T3). ER were assessed with a multimethod approach: parents and children completed a self-report questionnaire (i.e., Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and How I Feel, respectively) and then they interact during a stress-task in which physiological parameters (i.e., Galvanic Skin Response, GSR; Heart Rate/Beat per Minute, BPM) have been measured.</p></sec><sec id="sec1215"><title>Results</title><p>Regarding self-reported ER, mixed-effects regression models showed an improvement in parent emotion dysregulation between T1 and T3 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=0.004), a decrease in preadolescents&#x02019; negative emotions (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=.012) between T1 and T2 and a lower emotion intensity in preadolescents between the three-time points (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=.003). Regarding physiological ER, the two overall models of GSR and BPM were not significant for both parents and children. Yet GSR correlations within three-time points were positive and significant for children (T1-T2: <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>=.58; T1-T3: <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>=.68) but not for parents, while BPM correlations between T1 and T2 were significant for parents (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>=.49) but not for children.</p></sec><sec id="sec1216"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The online attachment-based parenting program appears to have contributed to a reduction in emotional dysregulation in parents and preadolescents, which seems to persist to some extent in the medium term. The non-significant results at the physiological level may suggest that changes reported by parents and children through self-report questionnaires do not align with changes in the physiological response to interpersonal stress experienced after an online intervention. Clinical and research implications will be discussed.</p></sec><sec id="sec1217"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
