Traditional barrier interfaces, such as porous membranes and microchannel arrays, present limitations due to inconsistent pore size, complex fabrication and device assembly, and lack of tunability using a scalable design. Our pillar array overcomes these limitations by providing precise control over pore size, porosity, and hydraulic resistance through simple modifications of pillar dimensions. Serving as an interface between microfluidic compartments, it facilitates cell aggregation for tissue formation and acts as a tunable diffusion barrier that mimics diffusion in vivo. We demonstrate the utility of barrier design to engineer physiologically relevant cardiac microtissues and a heterotypic model with vasculature within the device. Its tunable properties offer significant potential for drug screening/testing and disease modeling, enabling comparisons of drug permeability and cell migration in MPS tissue with or without vasculature.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">Microfluidics has been widely adopted to create microphysiological systems (<bold>MPS</bold>) that can be used to culture cells/tissues in near-physiological conditions via the provision of dynamic flow conditions, physiological ratios of tissue and culture medium, and the ability to create 3D tissue geometries. We and others have shown the application of these devices for drug testing and disease modeling.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Many of these microfluidic devices consist of a tissue chamber separated from the media channels via a diffusion barrier that controls the transport rate of biomolecules to and from the tissues. Two widely used form factors of engineered interfaces as diffusion barriers are porous membranes<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and microchannel barriers.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">Thin porous polymeric membranes have been used to separate the tissue chamber from the media channels.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The porous membrane allows the diffusion of nutrients and molecules as well as allowing heterotypic cell-cell communication via the incorporation of two different cell-types on either side of the membrane. The advantage of this approach is the commercial availability of porous membranes made of polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate. The porosity in these polymeric membranes is achieved via a track-etching process involving bombardment of polymer with heavy ions followed by chemical etching.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The fabrication process is scalable and allows for wide adoption. However, there is huge variation in pore sizes and pore position in these membranes. Furthermore, the process of incorporating these membranes into a MPS involves functionalizing membranes and cumbersome alignment with the microfluidic chambers during assembly.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">Another form-factor uses an array of microchannels as a diffusion barrier separating the media channels and the tissue chamber.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The hydraulic diameter of the microchannels provides the equivalent pore-size achieved via polymeric membranes. These microchannel-based barriers are incorporated into the design of the master-mold used to create the polymeric MPS device and therefore minimizes any cumbersome alignment and additional functionalization during assembly. Furthermore, the pore-size and position of the microchannels are easily controlled during the design and fabrication of the master-mold. However, patterning of these microchannel arrays, including pitch and length of the channels, are subject to the aspect ratio and design of the tissue chamber. This can sometimes be limiting while recreating heterotypic cell models across the barrier due to the discrete nature of the pores. Furthermore, a common procedure to load cells into the microfluidic tissue chambers involves the centrifugation of cells into the chamber or application of a vacuum, which results in filling of the tissue chambers. The diffusion barrier plays an important role in the successful loading of the chamber during the loading as they act as a burst-valve due to the air-water interface, thus providing a resistance during loading without cells escaping into the media channel. Thus, the geometric features of such microchannel arrays must accommodate a compromise between providing a hydraulic resistance for a successful filling of the tissue chamber and a diffusion barrier that allows biomolecular diffusion and ability to create heterotypic models across the barrier.</p><p id="P7">In this article, we demonstrate the development of a pillar array barrier in a MPS device that combines the advantages offered by porous membrane and microchannel barriers. We show that this pillar array diffusion barrier allows precise control over the pore location and the porosity that can be accurately tuned. The barrier does not require cumbersome handling and assembly. Furthermore, the polymeric pillar template allows control of the burst pressure and diffusion by simply changing the height of the array during fabrication. We hypothesized that control of burst pressure and diffusion by the pillar barrier allows robust tissue formation and provides an avenue to create physiologically dense tissue that models in vivo tissue physiology.</p><p id="P8">We implemented this barrier design in a cardiac MPS. We first present the concept of the barrier design, the fabrication procedure, and provide estimates of the burst pressure of different configurations of barriers. The ability to control biomolecular diffusion via alteration of the geometric parameters of the barrier is demonstrated via computational predictions made via the finite element method (<bold>FEM</bold>). Next, the ability of the barrier to accommodate the aggregation and formation of physiologically dense microtissue is demonstrated. The barrier allowed the exchange of nutrients to the microtissues at physiologically relevant dynamic flow. Lastly, we show how the pillar array can be used to form a barrier model that incorporates endothelial cells to &#x0201c;vascularize&#x0201d; a cardiac tissue.</p><sec id="S1"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec id="S2"><title>Design and fabrication of the barrier.</title><p id="P9">The MPS barrier consists of an array of pillars (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) separating two compartments, i.e. the cell chamber and the media channel. The porosity of the barrier can be altered by changing the distance between two pillars, defined in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> as pore size. In our design, the porosity is defined by the ratio of the volume of voids to the total volume. For example, for a simple rectangular space of 125 &#x003bc;m &#x000d7; 708 &#x003bc;m (see, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>), altering the pore size from 8 &#x003bc;m to 2 &#x003bc;m changes the porosity from 31% to 19% in a single configuration where the number of pillars is kept same (i.e. 8) and their pillar diameters altered to achieve the pore size. It is noted that porosity can be altered in multiple ways by varying the number of pillars and pore size determined via the pillar diameters. On the other hand, changing the pillar height allows altering the porous volume that controls the hydraulic resistance offered by the barrier to a biomolecule and/or cell. For example, keeping the pore size constant at 8 &#x003bc;m, the porous volume can be linearly varied by increasing or decreasing the pillar height. Thus, the pillar array barrier allows flexibility in tuning parameters such as porosity and hydraulic resistance that serve as a tunable barrier in an MPS.</p><p id="P10">We demonstrate two designs using different pore sizes and pillar heights in an MPS device. As an example, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> shows the SEM of a cardiac MPS that follows a design form factor previously reported by our group.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The major components of the device are a central cell chamber, two adjacent media channels, and the pillar array barrier. The cell chamber has a width of 300 &#x003bc;m, while the media channels are 100 &#x003bc;m. The height of both the cell chamber and media channel is approximately 150 &#x003bc;m. The cell chamber is connected to the media channels by the pillar array barrier of height 2 &#x003bc;m and pore size of 8 &#x003bc;m. Details of the fabrication protocol are provided in the <xref rid="S8" ref-type="sec">Methodology</xref> section. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> shows another form factor where the pillar height and pore size were 10 &#x003bc;m, and separate a media channel (100 &#x003bc;m width) and a circular cell chamber of 1500 &#x003bc;m diameter. In both designs, the pillar array acts as a barrier to aggregate cells within the cell chamber while loading and as a diffusion barrier that can model the endothelial compartment separating the microtissue from the perfusion medium, protecting the tissue itself from shear forces but allowing nutrient exchange. As a comparison to these pillar array interfaces, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">F</xref> show microchannel-based fenestrations.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p id="P11">In the next subsections, we report the characterization of the pillar array barrier in the cardiac MPS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) via burst-pressure and biomolecular diffusion measurements.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Pressure barrier offered by pillar array diffusion barrier.</title><p id="P12">The loading of cells into the cardiac MPS cell chamber involves centrifugation of singularized cells or spheroids suspended in a cell culture medium. For a successful aggregation of the cells/spheroids into a microtissue, the barrier must act as a burst valve to allow the cells to be contained within the cell chamber. During the cell loading process, the cell medium replaces the air within the cell chamber and faces a high-pressure barrier at the opening of the pillar array due to an abrupt change in the cross-section area, stopping the liquid advancement. Thus, the diffusion barrier in the MPS acts as a capillary burst valve regulating the fluid flow. Empirically, the pressure required for the liquid to burst across a capillary burst valve (&#x02206;p<sub>b</sub>) depends on the liquid&#x02013;air surface tension (<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b3;</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">l&#x003bd;</italic></sub>) and the hydraulic diameter of the channel (D<sub>h</sub>), such that &#x02206;<italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">b</italic></sub> &#x0221d; (<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b3;</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">l&#x003bd;</italic></sub>/<italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">h</italic></sub>).<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The expression of burst pressure depends on the capillary valve geometry as well. This forms the basis the pillar array barrier, whereby variations in the circular geometry within a single fenestra achieve a higher burst pressure (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) than a single microchannel-based straight fenestra (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To model the difference in resistance offered by a straight microchannel and a pillar array barrier, we implemented a level set method available via the COMSOL FEM package to simulate the air and water multiphase transport and calculate the burst pressures across different barrier designs. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> shows the computational domain used to simulate the air-water interface movement as we apply a constant pressure boundary condition to force water from a chamber (length: 150 &#x003bc;m, width: 200 &#x003bc;m, height: 20 &#x003bc;m) across a 125 &#x003bc;m length single fenestra of height 2 &#x003bc;m. The hydraulic diameters for straight microchannel and pillar array fenestra were kept at 3.2 &#x003bc;m. For numerical stability and convergence, the values for the interfacial properties were kept constant for both the geometries at <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b3;</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">l&#x003bd;</italic></sub>=0.072 N/m and contact angle <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b8;</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">c</italic></sub>= 66&#x000b0;. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> shows the transient volume fraction occupied by water in the fenestra as predicted by the level-set method for different applied pressures, normalized by <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b3;</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">l&#x003bd;</italic></sub>/<italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">h</italic></sub>, to obtain a non-dimensional pressure <italic toggle="yes">p*</italic>.

The pressure required to burst the pillar array was 1.5 times that required for the microchannel fenestra as seen from the <italic toggle="yes">p*</italic> of 0.27. The reason for this increased burst pressure can be explained by the pillar array fenestra consisting of a converging-diverging cross-sectional area that provides additional resistance for the moving liquid interface.</p><p id="P14">To validate the burst valve functionality of the pillar array experimentally, we recorded the movement of air-water interface as FITC-doped water was pumped into an empty cell chamber of the MPS. A representative sequence of these recordings is shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>. We pumped water at flow rates of 2.5 &#x003bc;L/min, 5 &#x003bc;L/min, and 10 &#x003bc;L/min. Time to burst was defined as the first signal of water in the media channel. Based on this criterion, we see a clear barrier function offered by the pillar arrays as shown by the differential time to bursts at the three flow rates (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). It is noted that as opposed to computational study, our boundary condition here is a mass inflow condition rather than a pressure boundary condition. This explains the different timescales estimated to burst. The gradual increase of liquid mass within the cell chamber with the flow rates allows the build-up of pressure and once a critical pressure is reached, the liquid bursts across the barrier. This takes a few hundred seconds with a flow inlet condition. A fluctuation of the liquid advancing front in the capillary valve as recorded during our experiments is provided as reference in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary materials</xref> (<bold>SV1</bold>). We see that when a high pressure of 6000 Pa is applied in our 3D level set model, the water interface bursts across the barrier without any fluctuations (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Overall, we can infer that pressure builds up with the gradual influx of liquid in the cell chamber. The moving liquid front within the barrier fluctuates until critical pressure is reached, at which point the liquid floods spontaneously.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Characterization of molecular transport across the diffusion barrier.</title><p id="P15">Since altering the pore size and pillar height of the barrier changes the porous volume, it allows us to tune the diffusion across the barrier. To characterize the molecular transport across the barrier, we simulated the transport of 70 kDa dextran when injected into the media channel at concentration of c<sub>0</sub> (7 mmol/m<sup>3</sup>) and a rate of 80 &#x003bc;L/min. The temporal evolution of dextran was obtained by coupling the Navier-Stokes solver in COMSOL to solve for the flow field and the Transport of Diluted Species solver to determine the concentration profiles. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> shows the transient evolution of space-averaged value of dextran concentration at the middle of the cell chamber. We used 70 kDa dextran due to its large size and hence lower diffusivity (D= 45.8 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>/s).<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p id="P16">The value of 80 &#x003bc;L/min was used as the maximal rate of flow in our device used in the case of metabolic interrogation. Using this flow rate, we plotted the concentration profile of 70 kDa dextran within a section of the cell chamber at different time points (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The temporal concentration profiles reveal that even at such high flow rates, the transport of dextran is near-Fickian, suggestive of a primarily diffusion-based transport. Thus, our pillar array barrier protects the tissue from the shear forces of the perfusion medium and allows nutrient exchange via a diffusion-dominant transport, modeling an endothelial barrier in vivo.</p><p id="P17">The tunability of molecular transport can allow for modeling different disease states or accommodate the differential diffusion dynamics in different tissues.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> We demonstrate that this tunability can be very easily achieved using the pillar array barrier. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> shows the tunability of 70 kDa dextran diffusion into the cell chamber via modulation of the pillar height and flowrate. We observe a non-linear reduction in diffusion times when pillar height is increased. A similar change in diffusion times can be achieved by altering pore size and pillar height while keeping the flow rate constant, as shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> for a flow rate of 20 &#x003bc;L/min. These results demonstrate that the pillar array allows high modulation of molecular diffusion across the barrier, and can be designed such that in certain configurations, the transport across the barrier is diffusion dominant.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Leveraging tunable diffusion barrier to design physiologically relevant cardiac microtissues.</title><p id="P18">We used the pressure barrier functionality of the pillar array to aggregate hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in a cardiac MPS. The cell chamber has a width of 300 &#x003bc;m, while the media channels are 100 &#x003bc;m. The cell chamber and media channel heights are approximately 150 &#x003bc;m. The cell chamber consisted of 3 pillars (each 75 &#x003bc;m in diameter), separated by 225 &#x003bc;m (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Singularized hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were mixed with cardiac-specific hiPSC-derived fibroblasts in a ratio of 80:20 to form a cardiac microtissue. Details of the differentiation and loading process are provided in <xref rid="S8" ref-type="sec">Methodology</xref>. Briefly, cell mixtures of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts were loaded into the cell chamber via centrifugation at 300 r.c.f. for 3 minutes. The aggregation of cells offered by the combination of cell chamber dimension, the pillars in the cell chamber, and the barrier function afforded via the pillar array leads to densely condensed cardiac microtissue in the MPS (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The microtissue is 3D as validated by nuclei staining and high-resolution confocal imaging (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We further quantified the number of cells and the volume of microtissue over an extended time (~months) and multiple biological replicates (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The mean values for the number of cells and tissue volume were 3685 (coefficient of variation/cv: 0.40) and 1.91&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup> (cv: 0.33), respectively. The cell density was calculated for each microtissue using the cell number and volume and had an average value of 1.95&#x000d7;10<sup>14</sup> cell/m<sup>3</sup> (cv: 0.26; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), which matches the values observed in human heart muscle.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p id="P19">After condensation, the microtissues in our MPS had mean dimensions of 243.8 &#x003bc;m &#x000d7; 621.6 &#x003bc;m &#x000d7; 124.7 &#x003bc;m (cv: 0.05, 0.28, and 0.95 respectively). We wanted to predict whether these dimensions of the microtissue would lead to the formation of necrotic cores, given the high cell density, and whether the microtissue remains metabolically active and viable. Thus, we combined oxygen consumption measurements obtained from 2D culture with a reaction-diffusion finite element computational model.</p><p id="P20">Briefly, we conducted oxygen consumption measurements across different batches of differentiation using an Agilent Seahorse XFe96 machine. Traces of oxygen consumption rate (<bold>OCR</bold>) were obtained at basal state and upon exposure to mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, protonophore FCCP, and rotenone and antimycin (Rot+AA) that inhibit complex I and III activities, respectively (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> We measured a mean value of single-cell OCR (<bold>sOCR</bold>) of 4.67&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> pmoles/s upon normalization with the number of cells per well.

Our mean and variation of the sOCR matches with data reported elsewhere in the literature on hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> To account for this wide variation of sOCR, we implemented a population of model (PoM) approach to the reaction-diffusion model (detailed in <xref rid="S8" ref-type="sec">Methodology</xref>). In this PoM, the reaction-diffusion model was solved 10,000 times, each time with a different value of sOCR that represented experimentally observed values.

Briefly, we spun coat a silicon master wafer with a desired thickness of photoresist. This thickness is the target pillar height for the barrier. After exposing the photoresist to patterns incorporating the pore size, the layer was developed to incorporate the barrier design on the master wafer. Next, another layer of a photoresist was used to generate the second layer (i.e. media channel) microstructure via the use of an alignment marker.

This microfluidic engineered interface acts both as a burst capillary valve and diffusion barrier to the tissue. We demonstrated the tunability of the barrier to control biomolecular diffusion via the alteration of the geometric parameters of the array. The cardiac tissue generated within these devices achieves physiologically dense tissue and maintains functionality afforded by the nutrient diffusion across the barrier at physiologically relevant dynamic flow rates. The pillar array can also be used to create tissue barrier models, such as vascularized cardiac tissue. The ease of fabricating multi-layered tunable diffusion barriers makes these pillar arrays attractive for creating scaling models for multi-tissue MPS platforms and creating sophisticated models for drug/therapy discovery and drug testing.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>METHODOLOGY</title><sec id="S9"><title>Fabrication:</title><p id="P26">The cardiac MPS was fabricated using photolithography and casting of polydimethylsiloxane (<bold>PDMS</bold>). Briefly, the design of the MPS device was made using a computer-aided design software package (AutoCAD, Autodesk Inc., San Rafel, CA). The design consisted of two layers: the fenestration layer and a feature layer consisting of the cell chamber with media channels. These designs were used to create two 5&#x0201d;x5&#x0201d; laser plotted photomasks, which were emulsions printed onto a transparency, with a resolution of 50,800 DPI (EMS Thin Metal Parts, Colorado Springs, CO). For photolithography, a 100 mm diameter Si wafer was first cleaned using piranha solution (1:3 v/v mix of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), followed by spin-coating of a thin layer of negative photoresist (SU8 2002/2005, Kayaku Advanced Material, Westborough, MA) whose height was equal to that of the desired height of the fenestration layer. After soft baking, the photoresist was exposed to UV light using the fenestration photomask followed by a post-exposure bake. The resist was then developed in propylene glycol methyl ether acetate followed by a hard bake at 180&#x02103;. A next round of spin-coating of a thicker negative photoresist (SU8 2100, Kayaku Advanced Material, Westborough, MA) was then performed for a desired height of the cell chamber. After soft baking, the Si wafer was aligned to the feature layer photomask using fiduciary markers to align the fenestration and cell chamber layers. The photoresist was exposed to UV light and then developed after a post-exposure bake. The process of hard baking was performed, followed by passivation of the Si mold by exposing it to trichloro [1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorooctyl] silane (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog 448931) overnight via vapor deposition. This master mold was used to obtain replica molds of PDMS by pouring 20 g of de-gassed 10:1 mixture of PDMS oligomer and cross-linking agent (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, Midland, MI) and curing for 8 hours at 65&#x02103; in an oven. PDMS stamps were peeled off after cooling to room temperature, and 0.75 mm holes punched at the loading and media port positions using biopsy punch (Ted Pella, Redding, CA). PDMS stamps were then exposed to oxygen plasma (Plasma Equipment Technical Services, Livermore, CA) for 60s (power: 21 W; flow: 98.8 sccm; pressure: 20 mTorr) and bonded to glass to create the device.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>SEM characterization:</title><p id="P27">Gold/palladium was deposited on the surface of PDMS samples for 100 s using the sputter coater (Cressington, UK).
