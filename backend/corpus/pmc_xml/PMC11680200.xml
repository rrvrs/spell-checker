A molecular epidemiological investigation was conducted on 2422 diarrhea samples from Chinese pig farms to enhance our understanding of the molecular epidemiology and evolutionary diversity of RVA. The findings revealed an average RVA positivity rate of 42% (943/2422), and the study included data from 26 provinces, primarily in the eastern, southern and southwestern regions. Genetic evolutionary analysis revealed that G9 was the predominant genotype among the G-type genotypes, accounting for 25.32% of the total. The VP4 genotypes were P[7] (36.49%) and P[23] (36.49%). The predominant genotypic combinations of RVA were G9P[23] and G9P[7]. Eleven RVA strains were obtained via MA104 cell isolation. A rat model was established to assess the pathogenicity of these strains, with three strains exhibiting high pathogenicity in the model. Specifically, the RVA Porcine CHN HUBEI 2022 (Q-1), RVA Porcine CHN SHANXI 2022 (3.14-E), and RVA Porcine CHN HUBEI 2022 (5.11-U) strains were shown to cause diarrhea in the rats and damage the intestinal villi during the proliferation phase of the infection, leading to characteristic lesions in the small intestine. These data indicate that continuous monitoring of RVA can provide essential data for the prevention and control of this virus.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>porcine rotavirus A</kwd><kwd>genotype</kwd><kwd>intestines</kwd><kwd>phylogenetic analyses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA</funding-source><award-id>CARS-35</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This study has been supported by the China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA (CARS-35).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-16-01842"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>From 2018 to 2022, the prevalence of porcine rotavirus increased from 22.7% to 51.7%, with clinical manifestations of anorexia, vomiting, and watery diarrhea [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The prevalence of porcine rotavirus has been increasing and is a growing concern.</p><p>Porcine rotaviruses belong to the Reoviridae family, are nonenveloped, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses with a genome size of approximately 18.5 kb, consisting of 11 discrete linear segments [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The genome contains at least eleven major open reading frames (ORFs), encoding six structural proteins (VP1&#x02013;VP4, VP6, and VP7) and five nonstructural proteins (NSP1&#x02013;NSP6) [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The genome is encased in a three-layered icosahedral protein shell, and the virions are approximately 70 nm in diameter. The innermost capsid is composed of VP2, VP1, and VP3, which encapsulate the genome. The genomic nucleic acids are closely linked to the VP1, VP3, and VP2 proteins. VP1 and VP3 exhibit RNA transcriptase and modifier enzyme activities. The intermediate layer is composed of 260 conserved VP6 trimers. The outermost layer is composed of the VP7 and VP4 proteins, which are essential for viral invasion and are antigenically active to stimulate the secretion of neutralizing antibodies by the host [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Additionally, the nonstructural proteins are involved in viral genome replication, translation, and virion assembly [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Rotaviruses are classified into groups A through J. Rotavirus A, B, and C are capable of infecting both humans and animals; among these, Rotavirus A (RVA) is the predominant strain responsible for causing diarrhea in nursing piglets. According to genetic classification, the genome of Rotavirus A is further subdivided into distinct genotypes [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The well-known dual classification system classifies rotavirus genotypes mainly on the basis of the VP4 and VP7 proteins. In this system, the P-genotype of the virus is determined by the VP4 protein, and the G-genotype is determined by VP7 [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To date, rotaviruses have been classified into at least 27 G-genotypes and 37 P-genotypes on the basis of nucleotide sequence differences in the VP7 and VP4 capsid proteins [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, this binary classification system tends to emphasize only the importance of VP4 and VP7 [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The Working Group on Rotavirus Classification proposed a new classification system for group A rotaviruses. This system is based on the homology of the entire genome (11 gene segments) and the homology thresholds of the different segments, denoted as Gx-Px-Ix-Rx-Cx-Mx-Ax-Nx-Tx-Ex-Hx. These represent VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5/6, classified on the basis of nucleotide percent identity cutoff values of 80%, 80%, 85%, 83%, 84%, 81%, 79%, 85%, 85%, 85%, and 91% for each segment [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since this method is based on all of the gene segments of rotaviruses, it enables further analysis of the host&#x02013;range restriction, replication, and virulence genes, as well as the epidemiology and evolution of rotaviruses [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Porcine rotavirus A (RVA) has not received much attention because of its low mortality rate and tendency to cause only small-scale epidemics [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the re-emergence and rapid spread of RVA have been reported in recent years [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Notably, a serious outbreak of piglet diarrhea occurred in China&#x02019;s pig-producing provinces, causing millions of neonatal piglet deaths due to diarrhea-related dehydration and weight loss [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The spread of RVA has caused significant economic losses in many pig-producing countries globally [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, the prevalence of RVA has accelerated the reorganization and mutation of its genome. RVA has several genotypes that are dominated by the G and P genotypes. The G genotypes range from G1 to G6, G8, G9, G11, G12, and G26, whereas the P genotypes include P[1] to P[8], P[11], P[13], P[19], P[23], and P[26] to P[28] [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Several studies have indicated that the predominant G genotypes currently prevalent in pigs are G9, G5, and G4, with fewer occurrences of G3, G11, and G26; similarly, the predominant P genotypes are P[23], P[7], and P[13], with fewer occurrences of P[5] and P[28] [<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Rotavirus strains of the same genogroup of RVA can undergo genetic rearrangements, point mutations, reassortments, and recombination events in all 11 gene segments of RVA, leading to a large number of genotypes [<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The diversity of RVA serotypes has led to more frequent occurrences of multisystem diseases, posing significant challenges to disease prevention and vaccine selection. This study investigated the positivity rate, genetic diversity, evolutionary relationships, and pathogenicity of porcine rotavirus A, aiming to provide valuable insights for enhancing its prevention and control strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01842"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-viruses-16-01842"><title>2.1. Sample Preparation and Detection</title><p>A total of 2242 diarrhea samples (taken directly from the small intestine) were collected from 150 different industrial pig farms across 26 provinces and cities in China between 2021 and 2024. The tissue shears used for each clipped sample were cleaned, disinfected with an alcohol cotton ball, and cauterized with the external flame of an alcohol lamp to prevent cross-contamination. Subsequently, 800 &#x003bc;L of PBS was added to each cryopreservation tube containing the small segmented intestinal tissue, followed by crushing the tissues with a tissue grinder. Total RNA was extracted from the collected samples after thawing and centrifugation using the TransZol Up Plus RNA extraction kit (TransGen, Beijing, China). A series of primers were designed to detect pathogens, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Porcine rotavirus A (RVA), and porcine deltacorona virus (PDCoV) using methods as previously described [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. RT-qPCR was performed by using the TransScript Probe One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) on a Step One Plus instrument (ABI). Briefly, the procedure involved an initial reverse transcription at 55 &#x000b0;C for 15 min, followed by pre-denaturation at 95 &#x000b0;C for 30 s. The qPCR reactions were run for 40 cycles with denaturation at 94 &#x000b0;C for 10 s, annealing, and extension at 60 &#x000b0;C for 30 s.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-viruses-16-01842"><title>2.2. Phylogenetic Analysis and Recombination Analysis</title><p>The reverse transcription and amplification of the RNAs in positive samples were performed by using the HiScript II One-Step RT-PCRKit (DyePlus) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). Briefly, the procedure involved an initial reverse transcription at 45 &#x000b0;C for 25 min, followed by predenaturation at 94 &#x000b0;C for 5 min. The PCR reactions were run for 30 cycles with denaturation at 94 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, annealing at 55 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, extension at 72 C for 1, 2 min (for VP7 and VP4 genes), and final extension at 72 C for 5 min. The genome of RVA was amplified using universal primers (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>) designed by our laboratory. The amplified RVA gene was subsequently purified and Sanger sequenced (Huada Gene, Shenzhen, China). The obtained RVA sequences were compared using DNAStar 6.0 (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). These rotavirus sequences were then compared with sequences in the GenBank database. The genetic distance between the isolates and reference strains was determined by genetic evolution analysis of nucleotides. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates via MEGA 11.0 (Tamura K, Stecher G, and Kumar S 2021). Simultaneously, the recombination detection program RDP4.101 (Simmonds and Welch 2006) was utilized to identify recombination events in the whole genome of the rotavirus; the characterization of recombination depends on the identification of recombination events through the detection of changes in phylogenetic tree topology.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-viruses-16-01842"><title>2.3. Virus Isolation and Identification</title><p>The supernatants from the positive clinical samples were filtered and then treated with 30 &#x000b5;g/mL trypsin for 1 h at 37 &#x000b0;C. The activated supernatant was subsequently added to MA104 cells (obtained from ATCC), which formed a dense monolayer. After 1 h, the viral mixture was aspirated and discarded. Next, DMEM containing a final concentration of 4 &#x003bc;g/mL trypsin was added. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed 24 h post-infection.</p><p>After approximately 20 h of RVA infection, the MA104 cells exhibit 60&#x02013;70% CPE. An indirect immunofluorescence assay was conducted on the cells that exhibited lesions. For fixation, the supernatant was discarded, the wells were washed and 100% methanol (Biosharp, Hefei, China) precooled at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C was added for fixation at the same temperature for 15 min. Following fixation, the blocking solution was incubated for 1 h. In the antibody incubation step, a diluted RVA VP7 (G9) protein monoclonal antibody (Biosharp, Hefei, China) was added. The cells were washed and then reacted with the FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Biosharp, Hefei, China) for 1 h. The cells were washed and incubated with DAPI at 37 &#x000b0;C for 15 min. The monolayer of cultured cells was washed three times with PBST.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-viruses-16-01842"><title>2.4. Western Blotting</title><p>Rotavirus-infected MA104 cells were lysed for 30 min with lysis solution (Biosharp, Hefei, China). Separation was achieved through electrophoresis, immediately followed by transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Biosharp, Hefei, China). Following membrane transfer, the membranes were blocked with 5% BSA for 2 h. The RVA VP7 (G9) protein monoclonal antibody (Biosharp, Hefei, China), which was diluted in 5% BSA prepared in PBST, was incubated at 4 &#x000b0;C overnight. The membrane incubated with an HRP-labeled sheep anti-rabbit antibody (Biosharp, Hefei, China) for 2&#x02013;3 h. After cleaning, the color developing solution was subsequently added to the dish, and the membrane was observed for well-exposed images, which were subsequently analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-viruses-16-01842"><title>2.5. Electron Microscopy</title><p>The cells were inoculated with a virus solution until lesions were produced and then washed twice with PBS. Next, 2.5% glutaraldehyde at room temperature was added for fixation. The fixed samples were subsequently embedded and then processed for sectioning. Following sectioning, haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining analysis was performed to observe the pathological changes in big mouse tissues. The sections were subjected to staining and observed under a transmission electron microscope (Servicebio, Wuhan, China).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-viruses-16-01842"><title>2.6. Plaque Assay</title><p>Once the MA104 cells formed a monolayer, the culture medium was aspirated. A virus solution was prepared and subjected to tenfold gradient dilution to obtain 10 concentrations. An appropriate volume of virus solution was allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37 &#x000b0;C. Next, a 2% low melting point agarose solution was added. After cooling, the agarose solidified into a covering layer, and the plates were placed in a carbon dioxide incubator at 37 &#x000b0;C for cultivation. The cell lesions were observed daily, and a second covering was applied when obvious lesions appeared. The mixture prepared using the above method was supplemented with neutral red to achieve a concentration of 0.002%. The plaque size was determined by measuring the average diameter of the plaques.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-viruses-16-01842"><title>2.7. Pathogenicity Studies in Rats</title><p>Ten-day-old Sprague&#x02013;Dawley (SD) rats were chosen for the RVA infection test to investigate virus pathogenicity. The rats were procured from the Laboratory Animal Center of Huazhong Agricultural University (Wuhan, China), and all experimental procedures received approval from the Ethics and Welfare Committee (HZAURA-2024-0023). Several strains of RVA were isolated from samples and cultured in cells. RVA strains exhibiting high viral copy numbers were chosen for high-dose gavage (7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> PFU) in rats, with 5 rats assigned per strain. The control rats received DMEM via oral gavage, and the rats were all monitored daily for any clinical signs. The intestines were harvested from each rat group at 4 days post infection (dpi) to assess the viral load. The pathogenicity of RVA was further investigated by selecting strains that demonstrated significant effects on viral colonization on the basis of the small intestinal viral load. Each strain was divided into three groups: a high-dose group infected with RVA at 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> PFU, a medium-dose group infected with RVA at 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7.5</sup> PFU, and a low-dose group infected with RVA at 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> PFU. The control rats received DMEM via oral gavage, while the rats were monitored daily for any clinical signs. Hearts, livers, spleens, lungs, kidneys, and intestines were harvested from each rat group at 4 days post infection (dpi) to assess the viral load in each organ. Immediate treatment is necessary for rats that succumb to RVA. The tissues were subsequently fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution for pathological examination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot8-viruses-16-01842"><title>2.8.

Discussion</title><p>As leading causes of swine diarrhea, PEDV, RVA, PDCoV, and TGEV are frequently encountered on pig farms worldwide [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Among these pathogens, PEDV has the most significant effect on piglet diarrhea. Recent studies have shown a decreasing trend in the positive detection rate of PEDV since 2018. This decline can be attributed partly to the protective effect of the GII-b strain vaccine currently available on the market. In contrast, the prevalence of RVA has shown the opposite trend, with its positive detection rate increasing from 4% to 10.45% between 2018 and 2021 [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

This study investigated the infection rate of RVA through a comprehensive analysis of 2242 diarrhea-related samples collected from Chinese pig farms in 2021 and 2024. The data revealed an RVA-positive rate of almost 42% in the pig farms where samples were analyzed. Further analysis revealed that the PEDV and RVA coinfection rates were the highest, at 11.5%, in this study. The positive rate of RVA and the positive rate of RVA in each region increased significantly compared with those before 2020 [<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The commercialized RVA vaccine in China only targets the G5 strain, while the results of this study revealed that the dominant RVA genotype in some areas of China is the G9 strain. It is not sufficiently protective for swine because of poor cross-protection between different genotypes [<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, RVA often presents as a latent infection in adult pigs, which can become symptomatic when external factors change or when immunity decreases.</p><p>To distinguish RVA genotypes effectively, a two-class nomenclature is commonly employed to classify the G and P genotypes of strains via the VP4 and VP7 genes. Owing to the high genetic diversity of these genome segments, at least 27 rotavirus G genotypes and 37 P genotypes have been identified [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Commonly occurring G genotypes include G1&#x02013;G6, G9, and G11, whereas prevalent P genotypes include P[6]&#x02013;P[8], P[11], P[13], P[23], and P[32]. The predominant G genotypes reported to confirm transmission in domestic pigs are G9, G5, and G3, accounting for 68.7% of cases. The predominant P genotypes are P[13] and P[23], accounting for 82.1% of cases, with the combination of G5P[7] genotypes having a significant predominance in domestic pigs worldwide [<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>In this study, 79 RVA strains from pig farms in certain regions of China were identified by G genotype assignment, and 74 RVA strains were identified by P serotype assignment. The G9 genotype was the dominant G genotype, whereas the P[7] and P[23] genotypes were the dominant P genotypes. Among them, the dominant genotypes of porcine rotavirus G genotypes underwent changes, with a decrease in the proportion of G5 genotypes and an increase in the proportion of G9 genotypes. The VP7 gene serves as the primary target of neutralizing antibodies, and a change in its genotype results in a reduced cross-protection rate between strains. This outcome was predictable because of increased animal movements among large-scale pig farms, leading to the high genetic diversity of RVA strains. The limited number of samples in this study cannot accurately reflect the incidence of RVA in some areas of China, but it still demonstrates the presence of RVA with multiple genotype combinations. As the prevalence of RVA increases, its genetic diversity also increases, leading to more diverse combinations of G and P serotypes. Therefore, continuous monitoring of RVA genetic variation can inform vaccine development and disease prevention and control strategies.</p><p>In our study, the PCR, IFA, WB, and TEM results confirmed the successful isolation of RVA. Eleven high-virulence RVA strains of different serotypes were orally administered to 10-day-old rats at high doses. After the experiment, the viral load in the small intestines of the rats was assessed to identify the predominant strains. Eleven RVA strains exhibited varying degrees of colonization in the rat intestines, with three strains having high copy numbers ranging from 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>2.16</sup>&#x02013;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5.08</sup>.

Homology and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the isolates belonged to the G9P7, G4P7, and G5P7 genotypes. Whole-genome sequence analysis of RVA strains is crucial for comprehending strain diversity [<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, whole-genome sequencing contributes to understanding RVA prevalence in Chinese pigs and developing vaccines targeting dominant genotypes. In this study, whole-genome sequence analysis was conducted on the porcine RVA strains, RVA Porcine CHN HUBEI 2022 (Q-1), RVA Porcine CHN SHANXI 2022 (3.14-E), and RVA Porcine CHN HUBEI 2022 (5.11-U).

In this study, a similar genomic backbone was detected in three different serotypes of RVAs: I5-R1-C1-M1-A8/A1-N1-T1-E1-H1, which is similar to the genetic sequences known to be reported in porcine RVAs from other regions [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Homology analysis revealed that some strains presented greater similarity to human RVA strains than to porcine RVA strains. This result confirms the interspecies mobility of RVA strains between humans and animals and the transfer of genomic segments between species, emphasizing the dynamic interplay of RVA strains between humans and pigs. Studies have confirmed the prevalence of interspecies recombination and reassortment events between certain porcine-origin RVAs and human-origin RVAs [<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study, a breakpoint in the VP7 gene of RVA was identified, suggesting that recombination events may contribute to the emergence of new viral genotypes.

Histopathological examination revealed acute inflammation of the bile ducts due to rotavirus infection, along with inflammatory cell infiltration in the liver and lung parenchyma [<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Rotavirus replication is also observed in macrophages within blood vessels and is accompanied by inflammatory cell accumulation [<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01842" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our histopathological examinations revealed that RVA caused significant damage to the alimentary tract and effectively proliferated in the intestines. The extent of the lesions also increased with increasing inoculum dose. These results indicate that RVA is highly pathogenic to rats. Currently, RVA is prevalent on pig farms, which makes it challenging to find antigen- and antibody-negative pigs for a model. Establishing a link between the porcine rotavirus rat model and a porcine rotavirus pig model could offer new insights and strategies for study.</p><p>The incidence of RVA has been increasing annually since 2015, and the prevalence of RVA has not been mitigated by widespread vaccination. This is due to substantial genetic variations among different genotypes of rotaviruses, leading to high susceptibility to cross-interchange. With an increasing number of reports about RVA, the virus has clearly become widespread on pig farms. Given the substantial genetic variation among different RVA serotypes, ensuring a match between the vaccine and circulating strains is crucial for effective prevention. Consequently, monitoring the virology of RVA and focusing on prevalent serotypes in China are essential, and the development of new vaccines containing multiple serotypes is crucial for preventing and controlling RVA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to extend our sincere thanks to the Wuhan Keqian Biology Co., Ltd. for their valuable help and support throughout the experiment.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
