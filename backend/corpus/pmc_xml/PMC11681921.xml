Chemotherapy has substantially improved survival, but surgical resection remains essential for cure; hence, intricate surgical interventions for local control become imminent&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Advancements in chemotherapy protocols, implant technology, reconstructive methods, and surgical approaches have shifted the paradigm in adolescent tumor (sarcomas) treatment. Previously, radical measures such as amputation were predominant; however, limb salvage has now emerged as the standard approach&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This transition from traditional amputation to contemporary limb salvage surgery has significantly improved functional outcomes&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Despite these advancements, concerns persist regarding the post-operative complications associated with limb salvage procedures, potentially influencing the psychosocial aspect of children and parents, financial burden, adjuvant therapy timelines, and long-term oncologic outcomes&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the past four decades, there has been an increasing number of limb cancer patients undergoing salvage compared to amputations in the prior era&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This shift can be attributed to ongoing research and the emergence of newer limb salvage options. Surgeons' ingenuity in addressing tumor defects and restoring functionality has significantly increased patient satisfaction. Moreover, studies indicate that limb salvage procedures yield comparable disease-free progression outcomes to amputation&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Research demonstrates that limb salvage surgery in pediatric patients with primary extremity musculoskeletal tumors offers superior overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) compared to amputation&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Limb salvage procedures, while offering significant advantages over amputation, can still pose complications. Early post-operative complications, ranging from 14% to 21.7%, are commonly observed, with surgical site infections, sepsis, and venous thromboembolism being predominant concerns&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Conversely, amputation cases in pediatric populations have been associated with higher rates of severe medical complications, including acute renal failure, cardiac arrest necessitating CPR, and myocardial infarction. Notably, approximately one in seven patients experience complications within the initial thirty days following surgery for primary bone and soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Advancements in imaging techniques and reconstructive options significantly contribute to the success of limb salvage surgery by facilitating the restoration of functional limbs&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Establishing a multidisciplinary limb salvage team has demonstrated promising outcomes, correlating with improved one-year survival rates&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As a result, limb salvage has emerged as a pivotal area of interest, with efforts directed toward refining techniques to improve patient outcomes&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, there is a significant dearth of prospective studies examining pediatric limb salvage following musculoskeletal tumors, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Therefore, our study aims to bridge this gap by evaluating the 30-day morbidity and mortality associated with limb salvage surgery in pediatric sarcoma patients treated at our center in an LMIC setting. Through this effort, we aspire to address critical knowledge gaps and contribute to enhancing the standard of care for pediatric oncology patients in LMICs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This prospective cohort study was conducted at the orthopedics department of a major tertiary care hospital in the developing world. Appropriate approval from the Ethical Review Committee was obtained. The study period spanned from May 2021 to October 2023.</p><p>Pediatric patients (aged less than 18 years) presenting with types of sarcoma necessitating limb salvage surgery were included in the study. After all appropriate consents and assent for participation in the study, patients planned for wide-margin resection of musculoskeletal tumors were recruited upon admission. Exclusion criteria encompassed patients who had undergone index surgery outside the study hospital or had previously undergone index surgery.</p><p>Data collection commenced on the day of surgery and continued for 30 days post-operatively, with meticulous recording of complications. Patient demographics, prior comorbid conditions, tumor characteristics, surgical modalities, and complications occurring in the early post-operative period were extracted as variables of interest. The data were assessed for both local and systemic complications. Tumors were categorized into bone and soft tissue tumors, with the final histopathology reports determining tumor types. Additionally, the presence of grafts and flaps, which can complicate procedures and increase the likelihood of complications, was recorded and tabulated. The plastic surgery team predominantly carried out reconstruction procedures. The study has been reported in line with the reporting Of cohort studies in surgery (STROCSS)&#x000a0;criteria&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>All data collected was stored in a secure electronic file, accessible only to the research team.

Quantitative variables such as age were reported as mean and standard deviation, while qualitative variables such as gender and complications were presented as frequency and percentage. The association of qualitative variables with post-operative complications was assessed using the chi-square/Fisher exact test.

These demographic findings align with established epidemiological trends&#x000a0;observed&#x000a0;in childhood sarcomas&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Limb salvage procedures for musculoskeletal tumors in the pediatric population have shown significant advancements over the years, resulting in improved functional outcomes and quality of life [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, early post-operative complications continue to pose a considerable burden. Our study revealed that nearly one-quarter of patients experienced post-operative complications, which exceeds the accepted rate for such surgeries. A study by Kathryn et al., involving 192 pediatric patients with similar pathologies, reported an overall complication rate of 8.9% [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Another study conducted by Yoichi et al. concluded an overall complication rate of 46% with a 31% rate of re-operation, which is significantly higher than our study. This can be attributed to the longer follow-up duration [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Conversely, Ziad et al. documented a postoperative complication rate of 21.7% in adult limb salvage surgeries conducted in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The variance in complication rates may stem from diverse geographic and socioeconomic conditions among patients and disparities in available resources. LMICs, in particular, tend to exhibit significantly higher complication rates compared to developed nations, as concluded by Hasan et al. [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The high complication rates observed in our study may have been influenced by factors such as limited access to healthcare resources, variations in infection control practices, and differences in post-operative care.</p><p>In sarcoma patients, post-operative infectious complications remain a concern. Kathryn et al.&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported a lower overall complication rate of 8.9%, contrasting our 26.3%. Variations in infection rates may stem from geographic and socioeconomic factors, with developing countries like ours reporting higher rates due to resource limitations. Adult studies similarly found infection rates ranging from 1.7% to 7.0%. Yoichi et al. [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]&#x000a0;also identified the infection as a common complication, with wound dehiscence noted as frequent, likely due to longer follow-up periods allowing for such complications to manifest. Our study did not address long-term complications such as prosthetic loosening and wound dehiscence due to its shorter follow-up period.</p><p>Patient characteristics such as age, gender, prior comorbidities, tumor type and location, surgical procedure, and neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies are often considered potential risk factors for post-operative complications. Prior studies have suggested a correlation between patient demographics and increased rates of wound complications. However, our study did not find a significant association between patient demographics and the incidence of post-operative complications (p-value &#x0003e; 0.005).</p><p>The anatomical location of the tumor is widely recognized as a significant risk factor for post-operative wound complications. Variations in anatomy, particularly proximity to critical neurovascular structures and joint spaces, pose challenges during surgical resection. Korah et al. identified the anatomical location of the tumor as a primary risk factor for post-operative wound complications, particularly noting a higher occurrence of sarcomas situated in the lower extremities [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].&#x000a0;Although our study results coincide with this pattern, with the majority of complications observed in lower limb cases, we were unable to establish statistically significant associations, potentially due to the limited size of our patient cohort.</p><p>Another significant factor potentially influencing post-operative outcomes is the type of lost tissue. Factors such as the availability and size of transferable local tissue, vascular inflow, and the chosen method of bony reconstruction play crucial roles [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].&#x000a0;Our findings reflect this, as post-operative complications were observed more frequently in patients with bony tumors compared to those with soft tissue sarcomas. However, statistical significance was not achieved in this regard.</p><p>While neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases the risk of infection by weakening the immune system, it is commonly used as an adjunct to surgery for high-grade tumors. [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]&#x000a0;Despite its widespread use, neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains a topic of debate among clinicians. A study by Gronchi et al. highlighted that the concomitant administration of chemotherapy and radiation therapy significantly increases the risk of high-grade thrombocytopenia and post-operative wound complications [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, our findings, consistent with those observed by Ziad et al., did not show a statistically significant association between neoadjuvant therapy and the occurrence of complications [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our study sheds light on the immediate post-operative outcomes and complications following limb salvage surgery in pediatric patients with musculoskeletal tumors, particularly in the unique context of an LMIC setting. Despite significant advancements in limb salvage techniques, early post-operative complications remain a formidable challenge, with nearly one-quarter of patients experiencing adverse events within the initial 30-day period. The prevalence of surgical site infections underscores the pressing need for improved infection control measures in LMICs, where resource constraints may exacerbate the risk of post-operative infections.</p><p>While our study provides valuable insights, its limitations, including small sample size and short follow-up duration, emphasize the necessity for further prospective research with larger cohorts and&#x000a0;longer&#x000a0;follow-up periods&#x000a0;to comprehensively understand limb salvage surgery outcomes in this vulnerable population. As a pilot study, we advocate for heightened awareness within the medical and surgical communities regarding the significant concern posed by infection rates in pediatric limb salvage surgery. Addressing this issue demands enhanced perioperative antibiotic coverage, stringent infection control protocols, and the undertaking of prospective studies with larger sample sizes to validate our findings and inform evidence-based practices.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
