Here, the efficacy of FVP, RDV, and FVP with RDV (FVP + RDV) in combination was assessed in Syrian golden hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV- 2 (B.1.1.7) following intraperitoneal administration. At day 4 post infection, viral RNA and viral antigen expression were significantly lower in lungs for all three treatment groups compared to the sham treatment. Similarly, viral titres in the lungs were lower in all treatment groups compared to the sham treatment. The FVP + RDV combination was the only treatment group where viral RNA in nasal turbinate and lung, virus titres in lung, and viral antigen expression (lung) were all lower than those for the sham treatment group. Moreover, lower viral titre values were observed in the FVP + RDV group compared to other treatment groups, albeit only significantly lower in comparison to those in the RDV-only-treated group. Further assessment of the potential utility of FVP in combination with RDV may be warranted. Future studies should also consider whether the combination of these two drugs may reduce the speed at which drug resistance mutations are selected.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>favipiravir</kwd><kwd>remdesivir</kwd><kwd>combination therapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Unitaid as part of a COVID-19 supplement to project LONGEVITY</funding-source><award-id>2020-38-LONGEVITY</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>EPSRC</funding-source><award-id>EP/R024804/1</award-id><award-id>EP/S012265/1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>NIH</funding-source><award-id>R01AI134091</award-id><award-id>R24AI118397</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>MRC</funding-source><award-id>MR/W005611/1</award-id><award-id>MR/R010145/1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>BBSRC</funding-source><award-id>BB/R00904X/1</award-id><award-id>BB/R018863/1</award-id><award-id>BB/N022505/1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>In-novate UK</funding-source><award-id>TS/V012967/1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>European Virus Archive GLOBAL (EVA-GLOBAL) project</funding-source><award-id>871029</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Swiss National Science Foundation</funding-source><award-id>IZSEZ0_213289</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Medical Research Council</funding-source><award-id>MR/836 S00467X/1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>UK Research and Innovation Strength in Places Fund</funding-source><award-id>SIPF 20197</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by Unitaid as part of a COVID-19 supplement to project LONGEVITY (2020-38-LONGEVITY).

Introduction</title><p>Since the first report of human infection by SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, more than 7.1 million global deaths from COVID-19 have been reported. During this period, new outbreaks have occurred due to the appearance of new variants of concern (VOCs), which are characterised by showing modified features of the original virus, such as greater replication rates and altered immunogenicity [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Vaccine roll-out has been highly successful in controlling the pandemic [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but continued development of treatment options remains highly warranted, particularly since highly effective monoclonal antibodies have been compromised for recently emerged variants [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Favipiravir (FVP) was originally developed as an antiviral for influenza [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and remdesivir (RDV) was originally developed for hepatitis C virus, but both exhibit a broad-spectrum of activity against many viruses [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Both antivirals are nucleotide analogues that are incorporated into the replicated RNA by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. While FVP induces lethal mutagenesis [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], RDV causes delayed chain termination to exert its antiviral efficacy [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Several clinical trials have reported efficacy of FVP and RDV as monotherapies for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, demonstrating a reduction in recovery times and a notable clinical improvement in mild-to-moderate disease [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, robust evidence of efficacy from randomised controlled trials is only available for RDV, and as such RDV but not FVP is recommended by WHO [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The combination of antiviral medications has been proposed for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The combination of drugs has been previously used against other viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), demonstrating greater efficacy compared to monotherapies and mitigating the resistance risk [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the case of COVID-19, different in vivo studies have demonstrated or ruled out greater efficacy when combining two or more antivirals, an antiviral with a pharmacoenhancer, or antiviral drugs with disease-modifying agents [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Syrian golden hamsters (<italic toggle="yes">Mesocricetus auratus</italic>) are a well established in vivo model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 transmission [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hamsters are susceptible to viral respiratory infection and show clinical/pathological features similar to those seen in human patients [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This model allows the evaluation of virological efficacy of putative antiviral drugs under different experimental conditions [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been used to determine and compare the efficacy of monotherapies and drug combinations [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>This study sought to investigate the efficacy of FVP and RDV alone and in combination following intraperitoneal administration to Syrian golden hamsters. The presented data demonstrate that all treatments reduced infection and replication in the lungs of infected animals. Histological analysis revealed no effect of treatments on the viral host cell pattern.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01838"><title>2.

The morphometric analysis served to quantify the area, in all lung sections of an animal, that showed immunostaining for SARS-CoV-2 NP. In Visiopharm, for each section, the lung was manually outlined and annotated as a Region of Interest (ROI), manually excluding artefactually altered areas.

The hamsters in the sham treatment group maintained the same weight for the first 3 days after infection and had begun to lose weight when they were culled at day 4 post infection. This differs to what is observed in untreated mock infected hamsters, where animals gain weight daily [<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] but is in line with what has previously been reported in hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a low inoculum [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As was expected, at day 4 the viral infection was confirmed in all hamsters from the sham treatment group by all the methods used in the study. Animals from this group were positive for viral RNA in the nasal turbinates and lungs, and exhibited SARS-CoV-2 viral titres and widespread infection in the lungs, as shown by immunohistology. Moreover, our results confirm that infection with the B.1.1.7 variant leads to histological changes and viral infection similar to those seen with the ancestral G614 strain, inducing a comparable disease and immune response [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The FVP group showed weight gain after intranasal infection with SARS-CoV-2, with weights consistently significantly higher than those in the sham treatment group from 2 days post infection onwards. All animals from the FVP group were positive for viral RNA in the nasal turbinate and lung. While the viral RNA was higher compared to the sham treatment group in the nasal turbinate, the viral RNA in lung tissue was significantly lower. This tendency in the lung was also observed in the plaque assay, histological examination, and morphometric analysis. Indeed, the PFU/&#x000b5;g of protein value was 13 times lower in the FVP group compared to the sham treatment group, and infectious virus was undetectable in one of the animals (#1 FVP). In line with this, infection of the lung in the FVP group was less widespread and associated with significantly less intense viral antigen expression, as shown by immunohistology and morphometry, with minimal histological changes. Previous experimental reports have shown that the same (300 mg/kg/day, orally) or higher (1400 mg/kg/day, intraperitonially) dose of FVP may reduce infectious virus titres in lungs, but no weight gain was evidenced throughout these studies [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], even showing significant weight loss from the first day of treatment [<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Whether the early weight loss was due to a toxic effect of the drug was not determined. However, in the current study, the histological examination did not reveal any evidence of pulmonary adverse effects after treatment with FVP.</p><p>In general, RDV had a comparable effect to that of FVP. Body weights in the RDV group increased consistently from day 1 and were significantly higher than in the sham treatment group at days 3 and 4. The viral RNA in the nasal turbinate and lung was significantly higher and lower, respectively, in comparison to that in the sham treatment group. Plaque assay results also showed lower viral titres in the RDV-treated group in comparison to the sham treatment group (4.1-fold). Similar findings have been previously reported using the same dose of RDV and route of administration (15 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In these previous studies, hamsters were therapeutically dosed from day 1 to 3 with RDV after being intranasally infected with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage A at day 0. Despite a viral challenge 10<sup>3</sup> higher than the current study, the viral titres were lower both in nasal wash and the lung in comparison to the sham-treated group, but only significantly different in the lung at day 4 [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Less widespread infection and a significant difference in the extent of SARS-CoV-2 NP expression in the left lung between RDV and sham treatment groups aligned well with the results obtained by PCR and plaque assay in the right lung. Most of the results showed a beneficial effect of RDV in comparison to the sham treatment group, except for the viral RNA measured in the nasal turbinates. This unexpected result might be explained by the small sample size (n = 4 per group). A larger sample size, especially in the sham treatment group, may provide more robust statistical power [<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>In the FVP + RDV combination group, while weights had started to increase by day 2, they were only significantly higher than in the sham treatment group at day 4, at which point this group exhibited the highest body weight gain of all groups (6% weight gained since day &#x02212;1). This combination group was the only group in which all outcome measures (viral RNA in nasal turbinates and right lung, viral titres in the right lung, and the extent of viral antigen expression in the left lung) were lower than in the sham treatment group. Indeed, the values obtained for the FVP + RDV combination group were the lowest of all study groups (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="app">Tables S2&#x02013;S4</xref>).

Like the current report, previous studies have observed that FVP (orally) and RDV (subcutaneously) mainly reduced infection and replication in lung tissue, but not at the nasal level [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Interestingly, intranasal administration has been previously observed to reduce infection in nasal the turbinate and lung for FVP, RDV, pibrentasvir, and nafamostat [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>An overwhelming statistical benefit of the FVP + RDV combination was not observed over FVP or RDV monotherapies in this study but is challenging to detect when both single agents provide virological efficacy. While viral RNA, viral titres, and the extent of viral antigen expression were lower after FVP + RDV combination treatment, the difference was only significant for the viral titres, as determined by plaque assay, and only in comparison to the RDV group. Similar challenges have been noted by other investigators who have assessed drug combinations. A previous study also evaluated the combination of FVP (300 mg/kg, orally) and GS-441524 (metabolite of RDV, 25 mg/kg, subcutaneously) in hamsters infected with 10<sup>1</sup> or 10<sup>3</sup> PFU of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage A [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The results showed a significant reduction in the virus titres in the lungs and nasal turbinate compared to the control and GS-441524 monotherapy groups, but not in comparison to the FVP monotherapy group. Another report determined the combined efficacy of suboptimal doses of molnupiravir and FVP [<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Hamsters were treated BID with molnupiravir (150 mg/kg, orally) + FVP (300 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) from day 0 (one hour before infection with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 BetaCov/Belgium/GHB-03021/2020 (EPI ISL 109 407976|2020-02-03) to 3 dpi. The viral RNA levels, viral titres, and pathology scores observed in the lungs for the combination group were all significantly lower compared to the FVP monotherapy group, but compared to the molnupiravir monotherapy group, significant differences were only achieved in the virus titres. Despite the challenge of discriminating efficacy, there are other benefits that are expected to accrue for drug combinations. Firstly, the use of combinations dramatically reduces the potential for emergence of drug resistance because of the need to simultaneously acquire different resistance mutations for all of the drugs in the regimen. Secondly, a combination regimen may be more robust in the face of emerging variants of a virus, which may be more compromised for one drug in the regimen than for others. Finally, different drugs penetrate different tissue and cellular compartments to different degrees, and one may anticipate better antiviral coverage across compartments for a combination compared to a single agent even though this is extremely difficult to assess empirically.</p><p>One limitation of the present study is that the drug therapies were dosed before inoculation with virus, and thus the outcomes are not reflective of treatment but rather may be more applicable to chemoprophylaxis. Since remdesivir is administered clinically as an intravenous preparation, it is not a medicine that is well suited to prophylaxis and is best suited to administration in the hospital setting. However, several groups have developed different prodrugs of analogues of the remdesivir active metabolite, to develop orally administrable medicines [<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, future studies should assess the effectiveness of FVP + RDV in treatment (including with immunocompromised animals), and/or assess the combination of FVP with novel oral analogues based upon remdesivir active metabolites. Another limitation to consider is that the efficacy of the combination was assayed only against the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant. Both drugs have maintained relatively constant in vitro activity against different variants, which have predominantly differed with respect to the sequence of the spike protein and not the polymerase. However, subsequent studies should consider sequence changes in the polymerase should they occur in future variants.</p><p>In the current report, we did not evaluate a sham infection/sham treatment group and sham infection/drug treatment groups because previous studies that have used similar doses and/or the same route of administration as those applied in the current study, both for FVP [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and RDV [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], did not report any toxicological effect related to the use of these drugs in hamsters. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that an intraperitoneal injection of 75 mg/day of FVP in non-infected hamsters (a dose 2.5-fold higher than the one used in the current manuscript, 30 mg/day) leads to evidence of toxicity; this was not observed with a dose between 18.75 and 37.5 mg/day [<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the case of RDV, no signs of toxicity have been reported using the same dose used in the present manuscript (1.5 mg/day, intraperitoneal) [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], or even higher (2.5 mg/day, subcutaneous) [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Combination therapies should improve efficacy through synergistic and/or additive effects [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], with the benefit of delaying the selection of viral drug resistance [<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01838" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Hence, while the present study did not holistically yield statistically significant evidence that FVP + RDV in combination was superior to individual agents, it seems logical to conclude that both nucleosides are incorporated by the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase without detriment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to the technical staff in the Histology Laboratory, Institute of Veterinary Pathology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, for excellent technical support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
