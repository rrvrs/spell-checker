The U.S Centers for Disease Control estimates that approximately 29% of older adults will suffer a fall, accounting for approximately 50% of all emergency department injuries and deaths in this population [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, people who suffer from falls are much more likely to have a fall in the future highlighting the need for further characterizing and identifying those at risk [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The etiology of falls is multi-factorial and arises from a combination of neurologic/balance disorders, cognitive impairment, muscle weakness, syncope, iatrogenic-induced illness, and/or visual impairment [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Despite their complex origins, most falls occur during locomotor activities such as walking for which alterations in gait parameters and control strategies may point to specific impairments and targets for intervention.</p><p>Given its relevance to safe mobility and protection against instability and falls, age-related differences in minimum toe clearance (MTC) have received significant attention in prior studies [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. MTC is defined as the minimum vertical distance of the toe from the ground during leg swing in walking [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. There are at least two potential consequences of lesser MTC during walking. First, lesser MTC can cause the foot to make contact with the ground or obstacle, precipitating instability or a trip [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Second, lesser MTC implies less time may be available to make swing limb adjustments or corrections in the presence of a balance disturbance prior to requisite foot contact. MTC has been shown to have increased variability due to gait pathology, such as diabetic neuropathy and peroneal neuropathy [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Conversely, although the evidence is mixed, several studies report that older adults without overt disease walk with altered joint kinematics that increase MTC compared to younger adults [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This may be interpreted as a more cautious strategy adopted by older adults to prevent falls.</p><p>While informative, a major component of falls in the community occurs outside of habitual locomotion and includes moments of gait challenges [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Balance perturbations are a class of experimental paradigms used based on growing evidence that even the most sophisticated balance outcome measures during habitual walking are unlikely to predict the way in which individuals recover from the instability that would precipitate a fall [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As a principal example, slip perturbations have been used to emulate gait challenges that may increase susceptibility to falls and a dynamic task in which MTC may be highly relevant for balance recovery in older and younger adults [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Indeed, some studies on patients with multiple sclerosis have shown that MTC decreases during a slip perturbation which may suggest a reduced time available to make neuromuscular changes necessary to accommodate slip-induced instability [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this context, decreased margins for corrective motor adjustments to accommodate slip-induced instability and ultimately decrease the probability of falling is of critical importance to our understanding various gait changes with ageing and clinical pathology. However, no study to our knowledge has quantified age-related differences in MTC during tasks spanning habitual walking to slip perturbations. This gap is important to address; better understanding age-related differences in MTC, particularly those scenarios and circumstances in which these differences are disproportionately relevant, could point to potentially modifiable factors to inform fall prevention strategies or rehabilitation programs.</p><p>The purpose of the current study was to quantify lower extremity kinematics and minimal toe clearance in older and younger adults during habitual walking and while responding to slip perturbations. We first hypothesized that, compared to younger adults, older adults would habitually walk with increased minimal toe clearance. Second, we hypothesized that younger adults would afford themselves more time to accommodate slip-induced instability via increased MTC compared to older adults. Finally, we hypothesized that &#x02013; independent of age &#x02013; increased minimal toe clearance would be accompanied by increased hip, knee, and ankle joint flexion which would be further pronounced during slips.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Participants</title><p>This study was approved by the University of North Carolina Biomedical Sciences Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided written informed consent prior to participating. Participants were recruited using study flyers and online announcements. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were evaluated using telephone screening. Exclusion criteria, chosen to ensure subjects could complete the assigned walking trials, included recent lower extremity injury, known neurologic disorders that would impact ability to ambulate, current use of medications that would affect balance or mobility, those without normal or corrected to normal vision and use of assistive devices. Enrollment goals included relatively equal representation among female and male participants. A power analysis determined that n&#x02009;=&#x02009;34 participants per group would have 80% power to detect (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) an effect size of 0.7 for between-group differences in MTC during walking. Using a questionnaire to determine eligibility, we thus recruited 35 older adults (age:&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;65 years) and 34 younger adults (age: 18&#x02013;35 years) to participate. After quality control for marker data integrity, 28 older adults (12 Females/16 Males) and 30 younger adults (15 Female/15 Male) were included in our analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>All trials were performed in the subjects&#x02019; own shoes. We determined each subject&#x02019;s preferred overground walking speed using the average of 4 timed 30-meter walks. We fit 48 retroreflective markers on participants&#x02019; pelvis, trunk, and left and right legs. Leg markers were placed on the sacrum, bilateral anterior superior iliac spines, posterior superior iliac spines, lateral femoral epicondyles, lateral malleoli, lateral calcanei, and lateral first and fifth metatarsal heads; torso were placed on the sternum, clavicle notch, seventh cervical vertebral prominence, and tenth thoracic vertebra. Rigid tracking marker clusters were affixed to subjects&#x02019; thighs and shanks.</p><p>Following marker placement, subjects walked on a force-sensing, dual-belt treadmill (Bertec Corp., Columbus, Ohio, USA) for two minutes at their preferred overground walking speed for acclimation. Subjects then completed one 2-min habitual walking trial and one trial that incorporated slip perturbations. For the latter, we employed a slip perturbation paradigm described in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to elicit walking instability and test the effects on MTC. Briefly, participants responded to a series of 200&#x02009;ms, 6 m/s<sup>2</sup> treadmill belt decelerations delivered at the instant of random heel strikes using a custom MATLAB script (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Following the 200&#x02009;ms perturbation, the treadmill belt returned to the subject&#x02019;s preferred overground walking speed over 200&#x02009;ms at the same 6 m/s<sup>2</sup>. A total of four perturbations were delivered (i.e., two belt decelerations per leg) at random steps during the trial, which lasted less than 2 minutes total.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Measurements, data analysis, and minimum toe clearance</title><p>Marker data was collected at 100 Hz and filtered using a 4<sup>th</sup> order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cut-off of 12 Hz. From these filtered marker trajectories, we calculated minimum toe clearance during the swing phase of both habitual walking and following slip perturbations. We defined a walking stride as the time between successive heel-strikes. We then determined minimum toe clearance from the first metatarsal marker using a custom MATLAB script. The toe trajectory during the swing phase of walking very consistently follows a bimodal curve (<xref rid="pone.0323307.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). We determined minimum toe clearance as the local minima between the maximums associated with toe-off in early swing and heel strike in late swing. During habitual walking, this value was extracted for each swing leg per stride and then averaged bilaterally over the 2-minute trial to give an average MTC for each subject per habitual walking trial. We considered an average of all strides during habitual walking. For slip trials, MTC was taken for the subsequent stride immediately following heel strike after a perturbation was executed. All four perturbed strides were extracted and averaged bilaterally for analysis. Finally, we used a scaled musculoskeletal model in OpenSim (version 4.4, gait2392) and inverse kinematics to calculate time series of hip flexion and adduction, knee flexion, and ankle flexion. For the same strides analyzed for MTC, we extracted the values of these joint angles at the instant of MTC.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0323307.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323307.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Group average (thick lines) and individual subject (thin lines) data showing first metatarsal vertical height for older (orange) and younger (blue) adults during habitual walking and in response to treadmill-induced slips over a gait cycle from toe-off to toe-off.</title><p>Solid lines represent the average for each age group throughout the gait cycle.

The primary findings of this study are three-fold: 1) In contrast to our first hypothesis, MTC was not significantly different between older and younger adults during habitual walking, 2) In support of our second hypothesis, MTC increased substantially more in younger than in older adults in response to a slip perturbation, and finally 3) In contrast to our third hypothesis, higher MTC during a slip perturbation was not accompanied by between-condition differences in joint kinematics and thus likely arises through a combination of smaller deviations spanning multiple joints. These findings, as we outline in more detail below, may have implications for the development of techniques used to identify populations at risk of falling and/or to introduce potentially modifiable factors for gait training to prevent falls.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Minimum toe clearance in older and younger adults during habitual and perturbed walking</title><p>In contrast to some [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] but not all [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] prior reports, we found that MTC was not larger in older adults compared to younger adults during habitual walking. Moreover, both younger and older adults significantly and instinctively increased MTC in response to a slip perturbation (<xref rid="pone.0323307.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). However, this instinctive increase was more than two-times greater in younger adults. The etiology of prior reports for higher MTC in older adults have been attributed to multiple characteristics of gait in older adults. For example, some studies have suggested that older adults walk with increased MTC as an adapted guard mechanism to prevent tripping/falling [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Others have shown that, like many other outcomes during walking, older adults who fall have greater step-to-step variability in MTC. Walking with increased MTC could mitigate the consequences of this variability, which would decrease the probability of inadvertent foot contact in a given swing phase [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The lack of a significant between-group differences in MTC for our cohort may reflect their relatively high level of fitness and physical activity levels. Though, as we discuss in more detail later, this further underscores the importance of our primary discovery that older adults appear to have a reduced capability to augment minimal toe clearance in response to a slip perturbation.</p><p>Although some previous studies have found a strong association between ankle dorsiflexion and MTC [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], ankle dorsiflexion was not a significant contributor to MTC in our study. This held true also when responding to a slip perturbation, during which older adults exhibited increased hip internal abduction and reduced knee flexion compared to younger adults (<xref rid="pone.0323307.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). This is not necessarily a novel finding. For instance, Levinger et al. (2012) found that individuals with knee osteoarthritis regulated MTC via changes in knee flexion and hip abduction &#x02013; similar to the between-group kinematic determinants we report here [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This suggests that, compared to older adults, the muscles contributing to knee flexion appear to be called upon in younger adults to increase MTC in the presence of a balance disturbance during walking. This may allow for an increased margin for corrective motor adjustments to accommodate slip-induced instability and ultimately decrease the probability of falling. That older adults may not be able to benefit from these increased margins should be considered in future work investigating mechanisms of instability and falls. Furthermore, the mean vertical toe trajectories shown in <xref rid="pone.0323307.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> do suggest that despite similar MTC during slips between older and younger adults, there are other phases of leg swing in which older adults have a much lower toe clearance. We suspect that although some older adults may walk with a more guarded gait habitually, this deteriorates in the presence of a balance challenge requiring rapid reactive control. This is consistent with what is understood about age-related declines in neurologic function in response to stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Clinical and translational implications</title><p>From a clinical perspective, the use of laboratory-based perturbations can be used to identify biomarkers of instability that may help to identify those at risk of falls. Indeed, understanding who is at risk and which features of gait are most responsible for that risk is the first step to preventing falls and subsequent injury. However, our recent work in older adults suggests that the response to walking balance perturbations is context specific; the structure of instability elicited by one context of perturbation may differ in functionally relevant ways from that elicited by a different context [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our results may have implications for intervention as well. Indeed, interventions for fall prevention may focus on enhancing the instinct of older adults to increase MTC in response to unexpected perturbations, thereby increasing the time they have to make neuromuscular corrections. Given the joint-level determinants of MTC during slips, muscles contributing to knee flexion in particular could be targeted for gait training to increase foot clearance and allow for improved margins for corrective motor adjustments. In addition, our findings also set the stage for studies of fall risk in those with more overt gait pathology. Several vascular and neurologic diseases have been shown to reduce MTC and alter lower extremity kinematics including spinal disorders, peripheral vascular disease, and peripheral neuropathies [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Individuals with these diagnoses are also at a disproportionate risk of falling [<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323307.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, most of the available data are observational in nature and there is a lack of mechanistic evidence from the use of walking balance perturbations in these patient populations. Further understanding MTC under the influence of balance perturbations could help understand why these patients fall as well as guide rehabilitation efforts for prevention.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Limitations</title><p>It is important to recognize some limitations of the current study. First, the head of the first metatarsal was utilized as the toe marker to calculate MTC which varies slightly from the point of the shoe. This was chosen as part of our standard marker protocol and is felt to be proportional to actual toe trajectories. In addition, we studied relatively healthy and physically active older adults. Thus, the age-related differences reported here may not generalize to older adults with more overt walking ability limitations or risk of falls.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study builds on prior work to conclude that, compared to younger adults, older adults appear to have a diminished capacity to instinctively increase MTC during walking in response to slip-like balance perturbations, which may allow them lesser time to accommodate instability. These data may be useful for identifying populations at risk of falling and guiding gait training to prevent falls in these groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec020" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323307.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>SupportingData_MTC.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323307.s001.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Aubrey Gray for her help with data analysis.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0323307.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Burns</surname><given-names>ER</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>. <article-title>The direct costs of fatal and non-fatal falls among older adults - United States</article-title>. <source>J Safety Res</source>. <year>2016</year>;<volume>58</volume>:<fpage>99</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>103</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.jsr.2016.05.001</pub-id>
