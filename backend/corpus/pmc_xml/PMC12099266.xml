The Sustainable Development Goals report of 2023 states that 73% of countries globally had made progress in improving child mortality whereas more effort still needed in reducing maternal mortality and improving universal health care, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (United Nations, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Gestational hypertension is reported to affect up to 10% of women world-wide, and is a major contributor to maternal and perinatal mortality (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2019). The prevalence of anaemia among pregnant women is reported to be as high as 45% in low- and middle-income countries compared to 18&#x02013;20% in developed countries (Haidar and Pobocik, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Majoni <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Kanu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Alem <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).</p><p>In Namibia, efforts have been made by the Ministry of Health and Social Services to reduce the Maternal Mortality Ratio to the global set target of 70/100&#x000a0;000 livebirths by the year 2030 (Heemelaar <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). However, a surveillance recommends improvements in local antenatal care policies and programmes to improve maternal healthcare outcomes (Heemelaar <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). A national enquiry into maternal deaths in Namibia found that hypertensive disorders were the second leading cause, after obstetric haemorrhage, of maternal deaths occurring from the years 2008&#x02013;2019 (Heemelaar <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Although the prevalence of anaemia in pregnant women is reportedly low in Namibia, it is still an important indicator to assess the quality of maternal health services as iron deficiency anaemia is a risk factor of perinatal complications such as haemorrhage (Mizanur <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>In 2013, more than 97% of women in Namibia received antenatal care from a doctor or trained nurse/midwife, with 43% of these expectant mothers making their first visit in their first trimester (Ministry of Health and Social Services, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The Ministry of Health and Social Services recommend for monthly antenatal visits until 28 weeks of gestation, and then every two weeks up to 36 weeks of gestation and then weekly until delivery (Ministry of Health and Social Services, 2011). The percentage of expectant mothers who made at least four visits to the antenatal care clinic as recommended by the World Health Organisation decreased from 70% in 2006 to 63% in 2013 (Ministry of Health and Social Services, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; World Health Organization, <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>The setting for this study was Intermediate Hospital Katutura which is one of the two largest hospitals in Namibia, based in the capital city Windhoek. The antenatal clinic is staffed with 5 registered nurses, 4 medical doctors, and 2 intern medical doctors. Nurses record patient details in record books and carry out physical examinations such as palpations, body weight and blood pressure measurements, test for haemoglobin, and urine dipstick analysis for glucose. The medical doctors perform sonars, prescribe medications, and manage any other matters referred by nurses. On average, 186 expectant mothers attend the antenatal clinic monthly (2,232 annual visitors).</p><p>Windhoek, the largest city in Namibia, is based in Khomas region which reported the highest prevalence of maternal deaths caused by postpartum haemorrhage and hypertensive disorders such as preeclampsia (Ministry of Health and Social Services, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Although the numbers of expectant mothers attending antenatal clinics in Namibia are high and health care services are accessible in most parts of the country, the types of medications prescribed to manage comorbidities in pregnancy has not been reported.</p><p>This study set out to answer the following questions: what are the common comorbidities among expectant mothers who attend antenatal clinics at Intermediate Hospital Katutura in Windhoek, Namibia?

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although antenatal care has been accepted by virtually all World Health Organisation member states as an important primary healthcare measure to safeguard maternal and child health, many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are still lagging behind in set targets (United Nations, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).</p><p>In this study, a small number (12.5%) of expectant mothers attended their first antenatal visit during the first trimester of their pregnancy, a figure which is much lower than 44% reported in an earlier national survey (Ministry of Health and Social Services, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This should be a concern as it does not signify improvement of maternal and child health care. Although it is not clear what the reasons were for poor attendance of antenatal clinics during the first trimester, a survey carried out earlier in Namibia, and corroborated by other studies such as the one in Malawi, indicate common causes to be socioeconomic pressures, beliefs, and attitudes, such as: a lack of transportation, waiting to miss several periods before confirming a pregnancy, distance to health facility, unhelpful/rude clinic staff, and payment of treatment fees (Ministry of Health and Social Services, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Finlayson and Downe, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Chimatiro <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). A study in Ghana reports that maternal age, level of education, and household socioeconomic status are factors that affect when expectant mothers make their first antenatal care visit (Manyeh <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Another study conducted in Peru reports determinants of first-trimester antenatal care attendance as the following: living with a partner, completion of secondary schooling, residence in an urban area, and history of a miscarriage (Moore <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Although interventions have proven effective in improving the frequency of attendance, early initiation has remained a challenge; a study in Uganda to assess the effect of community health workers to promote antenatal services proved ineffective in improving first-time visits during the first trimester and recommends for other approaches of promotion of early initiation to be explored (Wafula <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). This study only captured clinical data and left out socioeconomic demographics which would have been useful in shedding some light as to why the vast majority of the study participants did not attend their first antenatal visit in the first trimester. Nonetheless, the observed delay in initial attendance requires interventional efforts in order to improve maternal and child health which in this study would be reduction of prevalence of hypertension and anaemia. However, if the reasons mentioned earlier as to why expectant mothers delay the first visit are the same for participants in this study (Ministry of Health and Social Services, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Finlayson and Downe, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Chimatiro <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), then the possible solutions could be: community-based education on the importance of early visitation of antenatal clinic, involvement of the male partner, education of clinic staff on professional patient care practices to encourage attendance at the clinic, and governmental efforts to bring healthcare services closer to the communities, especially in rural areas (Totade <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Interventions at government level to improve early antenatal visits could include provision of mobile clinics and increasing the number of clinics per population.</p><p>Hypertension was found to be the most common co-morbidity with a prevalence of 15.7%. In this study, systolic blood pressure of expectant mothers was found to be associated with their body weight, but not with other variables such as age, number of pregnancies, or stage of gestation. Being overweight, obese, and excessive gestational weight gain have been reported to be associated with development of gestational diabetes mellitus and gestational hypertension (Sun <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Madlala <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Lackovic <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Furthermore, the odds for developing hypertension and preeclampsia per 10 kg pre-pregnancy weight have been found to be higher for expectant mothers with a body weight higher than 90 kg when compared to those with a weight of 90 kg or less before pregnancy (Macdonald-Wallis <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Apart from hypertension, excessive gestational weight gain has been shown to be associated with other adverse pregnancy outcomes such as higher birthweight, caesarean section, hospitalisation, and a low Apgar score (Go&#x00142;awski <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). All hypertensive expectant mothers in this study received oral methyldopa 250 mg daily as pharmacotherapy, which is the Namibia Standard Treatment Guidelines recommended first-line drug (and lowest dose) for maintenance therapy in pregnancy and in line with international guidelines (Ministry of Health and Social Services, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Michel and Hoffman, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). However, in order to mitigate the risk of maternal or infant morbidity it is pertinent for expectant mothers to aim for a normal body-mass index through healthy diet and exercise, after all: &#x0201c;prevention is better than cure.&#x0201d; Earlier attendance of first visit could be instrumental in expectant mothers receiving the necessary information on the importance of a healthy diet and exercise in prevention of gestational hypertension rather than having a delayed first visit when the pregnancy has advanced. Limiting perinatal weight gain with physical exercise and healthful diet are inexpensive interventions which are readily available and safe but must be applied earlier on in the pregnancy (Health, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Body-mass index was not part of the variables recorded in either the health passport carried by the expectant mothers nor in the records book which is permanently kept by the antenatal clinic. This is a drawback in the quality of data capturing at this facility as body-mass index is a useful variable in monitoring weight changes for any patient.</p><p>A notable proportion (13.5%) of expectant mothers had anaemia at the first visit, with levels of haemoglobin becoming significantly with increase in gestational age. The most common type of anaemia during pregnancy is iron deficiency anaemia, followed by folate deficiency megaloblastic anaemia which is mainly due to poor iron diet or a lack of iron and folate supplementation during the antenatal period (Sifakis and Pharmakides, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The Namibian Standard Treatment Guidelines recommend ferrous fumarate and folic acid supplements for the duration of pregnancy to prevent anaemia (Ministry of Health and Social Services, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). In low- and middle-income countries, common factors associated with anaemia include: level of education, socioeconomic status, family size, exposure to media, and residence (Alem <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). A study in India recommends promotion of frequent antenatal visits, iron supplements, consumption of iron-fortified foods, and offering pregnant women with financial assistance in order to reduce maternal mortality caused by gestational anaemia (Totade <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). It is worthwhile to note that all expectant mothers who attended the antenatal clinic at the study site received ferrous fumarate in combination with folic acid supplementation. This speaks to the evidence-based antenatal care that is practised at the facility and demonstrates the intention of the health ministry to offer quality healthcare to expectant mothers who present to receive antenatal services. Although the median haemoglobin was within the reference range, a substantial number were anaemic. In addition, it is noteworthy that the levels decreased with each subsequent trimester for first-time visitors which implies that expectant mothers who present later in pregnancy for antenatal care are at a higher risk of anaemia than those who attend earlier, which once again emphasises the importance of early first antenatal visitation. It would have been interesting had the information on haemoglobin levels been recorded in the patient passport as well. This would have allowed a comparison of haemoglobin concentrations at the first visit as opposed to several months later.</p><sec sec-type="other" id="s4-1"><title>Study limitations</title><p>One limitation of this study is that data were collected at only one clinic in Windhoek instead of all antenatal clinics in the city. Therefore, the results from this study may not be generalisable to the entire Namibian population. Furthermore, the records for the initial visit versus those for the follow-up visits were not from the same patients, the time was not sufficient for a longitudinal study that would have followed the same expectant mothers from first visit to their third trimester. Consequently, the cross-sectional study design was unable to differentiate between different types of hypertensive disorders in these expectant mothers (for example, chronic hypertension vs gestational hypertension). To overcome these limitations, the study included 354 participants which well exceeded the pre-calculated sample size of 339 for statistical significance. In addition, the results were simply discussed from the perspective of how current body weight correlates with the observed blood pressure. The relationship between chronic or gestational hypertension with weight gain in pregnancy could be an interesting topic for future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results from this study suggest expectant mothers do not start attending antenatal clinic early enough as very few (12.5%) had their initial visit in the first trimester of their pregnancy. The vast majority (87.4%) were in the second and third trimester at their first visit. 12.5% and 13.5% of pregnant women had hypertension and anaemia at the first visit, respectively. High body weight has a notable influence on diagnosis of hypertension in expectant mothers. All patients (with or without anaemia) received ferrous fumarate and folic acid supplementation while those with hypertension received methyldopa as recommended by the standard treatment guidelines. To reduce the incidences of anaemia and hypertension during pregnancy, government policymakers should find ways to encourage women of childbearing age to attend antenatal visits earlier in their pregnancy and to take measures for body weight reduction, respectively.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None.</p></ack><sec sec-type="funding-statement" id="s6"><title>Funding statement</title><p>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s7"><title>Competing interests</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="s8"><title>Ethical standards</title><p>The authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional guidelines on human experimentation (please name) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.
