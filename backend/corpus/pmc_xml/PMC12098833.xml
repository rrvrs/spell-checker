This underscores critical need to elucidate underlying local tumor microenvironment and systematic immune profiles for biomarker discovery. In this phase II trial (ChiCTR2000038354), the efficacy, safety, and immune-genomic signatures of sintilimab (anti-PD-1 antibody) synergized with chemotherapy as first-line regimen for ES-SCLC were evaluated. The regimen demonstrated a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.9 months and median overall survival of 17.1 months, accompanied by a 12-month PFS rate of 16.9%, fulfilling the primary endpoint. Manageable grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events developed in 27.3% (12/44) of patients. The exploratory study indicated a higher infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> CXCR5<sup>+</sup> T follicle helper cells, CD8<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident memory T cells, and B cells in tumor tissue, associated with better response and prognosis. The study also indicated the presence of tumor macrophages (CD68<sup>+</sup>CD163<sup>+</sup>CSF1R<sup>+</sup>SIGLEC5<sup>+</sup>) associated with immunotherapy resistance. Higher levels of monocyte-dendritic cells in pre-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells were found in durable clinical benefit group. Also, higher CD83, CD244, IL-12, and CD70, which are hallmarks of dendritic cells and activated T cells, were discovered by plasma proteomics to be connected with enhanced outcomes, while chemoattractant of macrophage, CSF-1, CCL3, CCL4, and IL-8, were found to predict a worse prognosis. Furthermore, a multimodal model was constructed and validated for stratifying ES-SCLC into high or low risk to predict the immunotherapy efficacy. This study sheds light on harnessing local and systematic immune profiles to better stratify patients with ES-SCLC for immunotherapy and putative combinational treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cancer microenvironment</kwd><kwd>Prognostic markers</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Clinical Research Foundation of Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital (FKLY20013), National Key R&#x00026;D Program of China (grant number 2023YFC2508604, 2023YFC2508605), Tongji University Medicine-X Interdisciplinary Research Initiative (2025-0554-ZD-08), &#x0201c;Young Eagle Soaring&#x0201d; Talent Project of Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital (Fkcy2408)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; West China Hospital, Sichuan University 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is recognized as a rapidly progressing malignancy, constituting 15% of newly diagnosed lung cancer cases, with the majority patients identified at the extensive stage (ES-SCLC) according to Veterans Administration Lung Cancer Study Group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> ES-SCLC patients, with dismal prognosis, had constrained therapeutic landscape. Etoposide and platinum remained as first-line standard of strategy over several decades. Recent advancements in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated survival benefits in SCLC management. Particularly, the integration of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade with chemotherapy has presented with significant potential in improving survival rates. IMpower133 was the first phase III clinical trial exploring the efficacy of ICIs plus chemotherapy in ES-SCLC, the addition of atezolizumab significantly prolonged survival duration (progression-free survival (PFS): median 5.2 vs. 4.3 months; hazard ratio (HR)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.77, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.62&#x02013;0.96; overall survival (OS): median 12.3 vs. 10.3 months; HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.70, 95% CI: 0.54&#x02013;0.91) compared to chemotherapy alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> The CASPIAN and CAPSTONE-1 trials, utilizing durvalumab and adebrelimab respectively, have validated the significant clinical benefits of ICIs, providing pivotal evidence for therapeutic strategies in ES-SCLC as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> These landmark trials prompted guideline updates incorporating PD-L1 blockade into standard care strategies of ES-SCLC.</p><p id="Par3">In addition to PD-L1 blockade, several recently reported randomized phase III studies, such as ASTRUM-005, RATIONALE-312, and EXTENTORCH, focusing on anti-programmed death-1(PD-1) antibody, yielded satisfactory results. The ASTRUM-005 trial demonstrated serplulimab&#x02019;s superior efficacy over standard chemotherapy, with significant improvements in both PFS (median 5.7 vs 4.3 months; HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.48, 95% CI 0.38&#x02013;0.59) and OS (median 15.4 vs 10.9 months; HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.63, 95% CI 0.49&#x02013;0.82).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Similarly, the RATIONALE-312 trial revealed tislelizumab&#x02019;s clinical benefit, showing enhanced PFS (median 4.7 vs 4.3 months; HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.64, 95% CI 0.52&#x02013;0.78) and OS outcomes (median 15.5 vs 13.5 months; HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.75, 95% CI 0.61&#x02013;0.93).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Toripalimab presented with promising results, showing prolonged PFS (median 5.8 vs 5.6 months; HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.67, 95% CI 0.54&#x02013;0.82) and OS (median 14.6 vs 13.3 months; HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80, 95% CI 0.65&#x02013;0.98) as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> These landmark studies proposed anti-PD-1 antibodies as viable therapeutic options in the ES-SCLC treatment paradigm. Though, the advent of ICIs has redefined therapeutic paradigms in SCLC, persistent deficiencies in predictive biomarker for patient stratification continue to hinder precision oncology implementation. This underscores the critical imperative to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of SCLC and identify reliable biomarkers for immunotherapy response.</p><p id="Par4">The quest for reliable biomarkers to predict immunotherapy response in SCLC has evolved through iterative clinical and molecular investigations. Initial efforts focused on extrapolating established biomarkers from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Paradoxically, in SCLC, the value of these markers for immunotherapy responsiveness remains controversial. In studies analysing IMpower133<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> (&#x02265;5% in tumor cells or immune cells) and CASPIAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> (1% in tumor cells or immune cells), it was found that although SCLC with high PD-L1 expression showed a better survival in the immune checkpoint blockade group, no statistically significant differences were identified. Similarly, TMB was analyzed in the EXTENTORCH study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> where the results indicated that regardless of whether TMB was high (defined as&#x02009;&#x02265;10&#x02009;mut/Mb) or low, the PFS and OS benefits of the toripalimab combined with chemotherapy were similar, with no statistically significant differences detected. Emerging transcriptome-based molecular classification of SCLC provides critical insights into patient stratification for immune checkpoint blockade therapeutic strategies. Current frameworks delineate four molecular subtypes (SCLC-A, SCLC-N, SCLC-P, and SCLC-I) defined by transcriptional regulators (ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and inflamed gene signatures, respectively). SCLC-I is thought to respond favourably to immunotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> In IMpower133 trial, only 18% of patients stratified as SCLC-I subtype, characterized by inflamed tumor microenvironments, achieved durable clinical benefit (&#x02265;12-month progression-free survival) from first-line atezolizumab-carboplatin-etoposide therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> While growing evidence suggests the existence of biomarkers in SCLC, universally applicable and clinically relevant biomarkers for predicting immunotherapy efficacy have yet to be identified.</p><p id="Par5">A critical barrier to identify biomarkers for ICIs efficacy in SCLC stems from the disease&#x02019;s inherent biological complexity and the scarcity of high-quality specimens. To address the obstacle, we administered a phase II investigator-initiated trial (IIT) (ChiCTR2000038354), which evaluated the efficacy, safety, and biomarkers of sintilimab (anti-PD-1 antibody) synergizing with chemotherapy as the first-line regimen for ES-SCLC. This trial incorporated a comprehensive biomarker discovery framework, uniquely integrating multi-omics analyses of paired pretreatment tumor tissues and blood samples. By using whole-exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing, multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF), flow cytometry (FCM), and plasma proteomics assays on pre-treatment tumor samples and blood samples from SCLC, we delineated distinct immunological signatures within the tumor microenvironment that demonstrated significant correlation with clinical responsiveness to ICIs. Furthermore, clinical variables and plasma proteomic parameters were integrated to develop a non-invasive predictive model for immunotherapy response. This model was subsequently validated in an independent external cohort. Our study proposes the novel conceptual framework and translational prospects for understanding the local and systemic immune profiles for differential response to immunotherapy. Based on these findings, a clinically accessible, non-invasive model was proposed to putatively guide risk stratification and immunotherapy strategies for ES-SCLC patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study overview</title><p id="Par6">Between December 10, 2021, and September 13, 2023, 52 patients were screened.

Intriguingly, a study comparing continuous immunotherapy versus fixed-duration regimens in NSCLC lacked evidence for a statistically significant OS advantage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> This finding partially corroborates our study design of 2-year immunotherapy, highlighting the need to further refine maintenance duration in SCLC.</p><p id="Par27">While combination chemo-immunotherapy with maintenance emerged as cornerstone therapeutic approach for ES-SCLC, sustained survival improvements occur in only a minority of cases. Enhancing immunotherapy outcomes necessitates accurate selection of treatment responders. Our multi-omics biomarker profiling using baseline samples deciphers ES-SCLC&#x02019;s biological complexity.</p><p id="Par28">The unique immune microenvironment of ES-SCLC modulates therapeutic efficacy to ICIs. Within the local microenvironment, studies have documented the populations of T cells and M2 macrophages possess predictive value for immunotherapy efficacy in ES-SCLC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> More importantly, our study identified subpopulations of T cells and macrophages with distinct roles in anti-tumor immunity, proposing them as potential biomarkers for predicting treatment outcomes. Our study revealed significant enrichment of CXCR5<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CXCR5<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell in ES-SCLC patients exhibiting robust immunotherapy responses, suggesting their cooperative roles in shaping anti-tumor immunity. Notably, CXCR5<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (T follicular helper cells, Tfh),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> known to orchestrate B cell maturation and germinal center reactions across multiple malignancies, may synergize with their CXCR5<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> counterparts (follicular cytotoxic T cells) to establish a coordinated immune niche.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> While Tfh cells potentially facilitate tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation and humoral immunity, CXCR5<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells likely contribute direct tumoricidal effects through cytotoxic granule release and IFN-&#x003b3; production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> In our study, the presence of CXCR5<sup>+</sup> cells may reflect enhanced tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) activity and the formation of TLS, both of which are associated with robust anti-tumor immunity. These findings align with previous studies demonstrating the role of CXCR5 in promoting immune cell recruitment and coordination within the TME.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> CD103<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which function as tissue-resident memory T cells, have been determined to predict prognostic value of ICIs in various solid tumors as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> Analysis revealed elevated infiltration of CD103<sup>+</sup>&#x02009;CD8<sup>+</sup>&#x02009;T cells in responders, underscoring their functional contribution to intratumoral immune activity. In addition, B cell related genes were enriched in the tissues of responding patients. An elevated B cell population was observed in baseline tumor tissue and peripheral blood. B cells were already known key components of TLS and positively correlated with patients&#x02019; response to immunotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> Furthermore, CD200 was associated with a better prognosis for immunotherapy. Two positive cells, CD200<sup>+</sup> B cells and CD200<sup>+</sup> CXCR5<sup>+</sup>T cells were observed in the DCB group. CD200 was known to be expressed in B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, which was used as a B cell marker in our study. CD200 also expressed in T cells, and played a crucial role in immunotherapy by secreting effector molecules, which contribute to improved anti-tumor activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> Thus, CD200<sup>+</sup> CXCR5<sup>+</sup> T cells identified in our study may demonstrate enhanced immunity potentially contributed to the response to immunotherapy.</p><p id="Par29">M2-like macrophages are believed to be associated with poor responses to ICIs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> our study revealed a detailed phenotype of M2-like TAMs. In addition to CD163, a conventional marker of the M2 type, these cells often exhibited higher expression of CSF1R and SIGLEC5. CSF1R, binding to the ligands CSF-1, promotes the accumulation of TAMs with an immunosuppressive phenotype,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> mediating tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. As a constituent of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (SIGLECs) family, SIGLEC5 predominantly localizes to myeloid cell surfaces, notably macrophages. As an inhibitory receptor, SIGLEC5 engagement by sialylated ligands can inhibit pro-inflammatory responses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> promoting a more immunosuppressive environment. This may help tumors evade immune surveillance by reducing macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and cytokine production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> Our findings delineates critical associations between the tumor immune landscape and therapeutic responsiveness in ES-SCLC, highlighting the clinical relevance of immunophenotypic diversity. The marked enrichment of SIGLEC5<sup>+</sup> and CSF1R<sup>+</sup> M2-polarized macrophages within the NDB cohort demonstrates their immunosuppressive function. These findings collectively highlight blocking CSF-1/CSF1R axis may be an effective strategy to circumvent immunotherapy resistance in ES-SCLC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup></p><p id="Par30">Beyond characterizing the local immune microenvironment, baseline elevations in B lymphocytes, DCs and monocytes of PBMC were displayed in DCB patients. These findings proposed a systemic-peripheral immune repertoire that orchestrated antitumor immunity. Thus, building upon previous acknowledgement of immune cell populations with distinct contributions to ICI efficacy, eight plasma proteins engaging immune cell activation, chemotaxis, and differentiation were identified. Furthermore, a non-invasive immune efficacy prediction model for ES-SCLC patients was developed and validated integrating levels of plasma proteins and efficacy-related clinical features. The model included six plasma proteins including CSF-1, CCL4, CCL3, CD83, IL-12, and CD244. Chemokines (CCL3/4) and cytokines (CSF-1) involved in monocyte recruitment and M2-TAM maturation, respectively, were associated with unflavoured response to ICIs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> The expression of CD244 has been shown on the surface of tumor-infiltrating monocytes, and it is associated with an immunosuppressive phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> These CD244 expressing monocytes may be recruited to tumor tissues in response to chemokines like CSF-1, CCL3/4.

Firstly, the sample was small. And the single-center, single-arm trial, conducted exclusively in Chinese population with a relatively high proportion of male participants, inherently constrains the generalizability of results to broader populations, necessitating ongoing follow-up to validate long-term outcomes. The inherent susceptibility of blood-based biomarkers to confounding variables necessitates rigorous multi-cohort validation to disentangle predictive versus prognostic utility. And development of clinically accessible detection methods to complement the Olink-based plasma protein analysis employed in our study should also be conducted in the future. Moreover, due to the limited number of biopsies and difficulties in obtaining fresh tissue in clinical practice, single-cell sequencing could not be conducted, which was another limitation in this study. The incorporation of single-cell sequencing in future studies is warranted to further investigate the TME and enhance the robustness of our findings.
