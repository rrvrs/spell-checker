Research shows a lack of mental health knowledge and inappropriate practices in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. Our study aimed to evaluate individuals&#x02019; perspectives on mental health by analyzing their responses to a digital campaign directed at GCC adolescents. We conducted a qualitative thematic analysis of comments in response to the Gulf Health Council&#x02019;s mental health campaign. The campaign content was shared on four social media platforms: TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, and X. A total of 2,146 comments were included in the analysis. There was a widespread denial of the existence of mental illness. The comments revealed a lack of understanding and insufficient support for individuals dealing with mental health issues. Stigma and discrimination against people with mental illness were evident in the comments. The general perception was that individuals have control over their mental health, often associating mental illness with weakness and lack of willpower. Mental illness was believed to be caused by religious and moral shortcomings, and religion was viewed as the solution. Some comments highlighted the need to acknowledge mental illness and urged the development of strategies to promote mental health. Our research shows a lack of awareness, stigma, and inadequate resources for individuals dealing with mental health issues. It highlights the importance of addressing barriers to mental healthcare and increasing access to support. Interventions focusing on stigma reduction and promoting acceptance of mental health disorders are crucial and require collaborative efforts from various stakeholders.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>digital health</kwd><kwd>mental illness</kwd><kwd>culture</kwd><kwd>religion</kwd><kwd>stigma</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="41"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="6554"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>section-at-acceptance</meta-name><meta-value>Public Mental Health</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2019, one in eight people was living with a mental health disorder globally (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The rates of anxiety and depression increased dramatically in 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is facing a significant burden of mental disorders (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It is estimated that around 15% of the population is affected by depression, while 10% are affected by general anxiety disorder. However, socio-cultural beliefs surrounding mental health in the MENA region may have led to under-reporting and under-diagnosis of mental health disorders. People with mental health issues often have limited access to adequate care, which can be attributed partly to the stigma and discrimination that they face, negatively impacting their experience (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>The way mental health issues are perceived, diagnosed, and treated can differ significantly based on cultural beliefs, values, and practices (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). For example, some cultures consider mental illness as a spiritual issue or a punishment from God (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In the context of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, spirituality and religiosity play a profound role in shaping perceptions of mental health (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The strong influence of Islamic teachings in the region means that religious beliefs often intersect with health practices (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This can lead to a dual effect: on the one hand, religion can provide a source of comfort, support, and community cohesion, promoting positive mental health outcomes through shared beliefs and practices (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). On the other hand, it can perpetuate misconceptions about the nature of mental illness, such as associating it with supernatural causes or viewing it as a result of insufficient faith or spiritual failings (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These beliefs may lead to stigmatization, reluctance to seek professional help, and a preference for religious or traditional healing methods over medical treatment (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Studies conducted in the Arab states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have revealed a limited level of mental health literacy and inappropriate mental health practices among both the general public and healthcare professionals (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). For instance, some people believe that a lack of religiosity causes mental illness (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This belief, combined with the lack of knowledge, leads to stigmatization and negative attitudes toward people with mental health disorders (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Cultural beliefs toward mental health influenced healthcare professionals&#x02019; views about mental health disorders and contributed to the inadequate availability of mental healthcare services (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Some healthcare professionals in the GCC and MENA regions link mental illness with weakness and believe that mental health should be treated by seeking social and religious support (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Several campaigns and interventions are in place worldwide to reduce stigma toward mental health disorders and promote mental health. Anti-stigma interventions using different media platforms (mass media and social media) can potentially improve people&#x02019;s knowledge and attitudes toward mental health and encourage positive mental health practices (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Although the effectiveness of digital interventions in supporting mental health has been established, these interventions must be personalized to the population&#x02019;s needs, and access to them must be facilitated (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>The Gulf Health Council (GHC) is active in the GCC region&#x02019;s preventive, curative and rehabilitative health (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). One of the main objectives of the GHC is to spread culturally and religiously appropriate health awareness programs among GCC countries, citizens, and residents. The GCC region is part of the MENA region and includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Islam is the predominant religion in the GCC region, with countries in the GCC region sharing similar languages (Arabic) and cultural practices.</p><p>In 2021, the Gulf Health Council (GHC) launched a comprehensive campaign aimed at improving mental health awareness among young individuals across the GCC region (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The initiative sought to address the urgent mental health issues youth face by utilizing various resources. This included interactive online assessment tools and thorough educational content covering various mental health aspects. To make the message more relatable and impactful, the campaign featured compelling narratives from young people who shared their personal experiences with mental illness (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These stories sought to foster a deeper understanding of mental health challenges and reduce stigma within the community. The campaign highlighted the importance of support systems, encouraged open conversations about mental well-being, and emphasized the necessity of seeking treatment.</p><p>It is essential to examine the unique responses of the Muslim and Arab communities concerning mental health discussions. By understanding their distinct perspectives and lived experiences, we can more effectively address mental health challenges within the GCC region. This understanding will enhance our approach and inform impactful public health interventions for a healthier future, combating stigma and fostering a supportive environment for mental well-being.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study aimed to investigate people&#x02019;s opinions and views toward a mental health digital campaign targeted at adolescents and young adults in the GCC. The campaign was developed by a team of public health experts and content creators, and the content was produced in Arabic. In September 2021, the GHC launched a three-month mental health campaign to promote mental health awareness among individuals aged 11&#x02013;25 in the GCC region. The campaign included culturally and religiously appropriate online mental health assessment tools, educational infographics, manuals, and videos featuring narratives from adolescents and young adults living with mental illness. Key messages such as &#x02018;You are fine,&#x02019; &#x02018;Be a man,&#x02019; and &#x02018;It is just a phase&#x02019; were included in the videos to reflect community attitudes toward mental health. The video was nearly 2&#x0202f;min long and targeted audiences in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain. The campaign content was shared on GHC&#x02019;s official social media accounts, which have followers from the GCC and other nations. The content reached 1 million views and received almost 3,000 engagements across various social media platforms. We performed a qualitative thematic analysis of comments posted in response to the campaign on four social media platforms (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, and X). There is diversity in the characteristics of followers based on the social media platform. For example, GHC X account followers were mainly males aged between 18 and 44, while GHC Instagram account followers were mostly females aged between 25 and 44 (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><sec id="sec3"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p>Murdock&#x02019;s ill-health theoretical model influenced our exploration of perceptions of mental health (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). According to Murdock, it is vital to differentiate between natural and supernatural beliefs about disease causes (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Therefore, to better understand people&#x02019;s perceptions about mental health, views on mental health could be linked to physiological or mystical causes. The importance of each definition of disease causation (natural vs. supernatural) varies across different societies, guiding our study&#x02019;s design and conceptualisation.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Data collection</title><p>We extracted all comments on the campaign on four social media platforms (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok and X) from the 1st of September 2021 to the 10th of December 2021. We extracted all the comments posted on the campaign content from the beginning until 10&#x0202f;days after the last post. The lifespan of social media posts on most platforms is, at most, 9&#x0202f;days (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Therefore, we do not expect more relevant comments to be posted ten days following the campaign. We identified 2,921 comments and extracted the data into an Excel file for data cleaning. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> details the comments included from each platform and the data cleaning process. We excluded duplicate comments, advertisements, or comments unrelated to the research aim from the analysis. After data cleaning, 2,146 comments were included in the analysis.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Process of cleaning datasets for qualitative analysis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpubh-12-1477315-g001" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data was analyzed using thematic analysis (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). All comments were exported to ATLAS.ti for coding. All included comments were coded independently by SA, and a random sample of the comments from all platforms was double-coded by NA. Both coders, SA and NA, are Saudi female public health researchers experienced in qualitative research. They are trained in public health interventions and are interested in mental health research. Codes were then discussed between authors, and amendments were made in an iterative process to develop an initial coding frame. To ensure a comprehensive interpretation of the data, authors moved continuously between data familiarization, interpretations, and reporting. Once codes were refined, codes were grouped and categorized thematically to create initial themes. All quotes included in the findings were independently translated from Arabic to English by two authors (SA and NA), and then the final translation was jointly agreed upon.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Whether data shared on social media is considered private or public remains a topic of debate (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, comments on a public platform could be regarded as &#x0201c;public data&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). We removed identifiable information, such as usernames, from the published data to ensure ethical standards. Additionally, all quotes presented in the paper have been translated from Arabic to English, making it difficult to trace their source. We have only included comments made publicly; any data provided through direct messages or private accounts was excluded from the data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec7"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 2,146 comments were included in the analysis.

</p></disp-quote><p>Some comments minimized mental health issues by suggesting that negative thoughts or feeling down do not necessarily mean depression. For example, many comments mentioned that it is expected to &#x0201c;feel down&#x0201d; sometimes and that social isolation is a &#x0201c;personal choice&#x0201d; and a preference for many people.</p><disp-quote><p>

Our findings highlight significant misconceptions and stigmas surrounding mental health in the GCC community. Mental illness is often believed to be caused by witchcraft or physical illness and is associated with poor religious beliefs. Dealing with mental health issues is perceived as a weakness and lack of willpower. Coping with mental illness is believed to be within the person&#x02019;s control, and having a positive attitude is seen as the solution. The lack of strategies to promote mental health and the stigma attached to mental illness can hinder seeking appropriate medical care.</p><p>Comments revealed significant stigma surrounding mental illness. The negative impact of mental health stigma has been well documented and described by those with mental illness as &#x02018;worse than the illness itself&#x02019; (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Negative attitudes and stigma toward mental illness result from a complex set of factors (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Stigma toward mental illness can be influenced by poor health literacy, lack of mental healthcare services, cultural perspectives, and religious beliefs. Research revealed that Muslims have lower mental health literacy compared to non-Muslims (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, recent studies show significant improvements in mental health literacy and considerable reductions in mental health stigma in certain countries and for specific mental health conditions (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). These reductions have been reportedly linked to improvements in education, healthcare infrastructure, accessibility, and high levels of exposure to mental health campaigns in recent years (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref>).</p><p>Our findings revealed that a prevalent belief was that supernatural forces, such as witchcraft or the evil eye, could cause mental illness. This belief aligns with existing literature on the cultural context of mental health in the GCC, where mental illness is often attributed to external spiritual influences, such as Jinn (evil spirits) or black magic (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). This belief reflects a significant cultural context that shapes public perceptions of mental health within the GCC. Such perceptions further complicate the recognition of mental health disorders as legitimate medical conditions and contribute to stigma (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). These findings underscore the importance of addressing these cultural beliefs when developing mental health interventions, as they can influence both the willingness to seek professional help and the way mental health issues are perceived by society (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Religious coping emerged as a prominent theme in the comments, with many participants attributing their mental health resilience to religious practices. It is also well-documented that many conservative communities believe that mental illness is a punishment from God for moral shortcomings (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This poses a significant public health challenge as it can hinder the recognition of medical or psychiatric issues by patients and their family members (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The association of mental illness with evil spirits and moral failings often lead to individuals with mental illness being ostracized from society and subjected to harmful traditional practices believed to treat mental illness (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>Religious beliefs play a significant role in shaping people&#x02019;s attitudes toward mental illness (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Consistent with our findings, many Muslims often prefer seeking religious guidance over professional help (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). A study comparing the attitudes toward mental health between young British Muslims and non-Muslims found that over one-third of Muslims in their sample would consider stopping their psychotropic medication if advised by a non-medically trained religious leader (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). This emphasizes the critical need to consider spiritual and cultural sensitivity when developing interventions targeting mental health within Muslim communities.</p><sec id="sec14"><title>Implications for research, policy and practice</title><p>Despite the Arab countries representing 5.54% of the global population, the mental health research output accounts for 1.0% of the worldwide peer-reviewed publications (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The lack of mental health research can hinder the development of effective treatments and interventions for mental health disorders. Therefore, there is an urgent need for increased research efforts to address the burden of mental illness in the Arab region and facilitate the improvement of the overall well-being and quality of life of individuals affected by mental disorders.</p><p>Some commenters highlighted a lack of strategies that go beyond raising awareness. While awareness is essential, interventions that promote mental well-being, focusing on stigma reduction and acceptance of mental health disorders, are necessary. This can be a crucial step toward improving mental health promotion. Ensuring people can access appropriate interventions to help them lead healthy lives and maintain their mental well-being is essential. This will require a concerted effort from individuals, healthcare providers, policymakers, and religious leaders to develop and implement effective strategies to address this issue.</p><p>Addressing mental health stigma requires a comprehensive approach that considers cultural, religious, and societal factors and promotes health literacy, education, and support (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Anti-stigma interventions are vital for promoting positive attitudes, improving mental health literacy, and potentially reducing public and self-stigma associated with mental illness (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Integrating mental health education in schools has been proven effective in reducing mental health stigma and improving help-seeking behaviors (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Collaboration between mental health professionals and religious leaders can facilitate addressing misconceptions and encourage support and treatment for individuals with mental illness (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Integrating mental health services within primary care settings has the potential to improve accessibility to mental healthcare and reduce the stigma associated with seeking mental health support (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p><p>The connection between mental illness and supernatural causes remains a central theme in the cultural context of the region (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This suggests that while mental illness may not always be directly linked to Jinn (evil spirits) in individual cases, such beliefs still hold sway in shaping attitudes toward mental health, underscoring the need for culturally tailored mental health education and intervention strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sec15"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study presents unique findings based on the methodology used. To our knowledge, this is the first study that examines the public&#x02019;s reactions to mental health awareness content in a neutral environment in the GCC. By analyzing comments posted online, we aimed to minimize the impact of social desirability bias, as these comments reflect the honest opinions of the commenters. We have included all the comments posted in response to the campaign on four different social media platforms, which means we have captured the thoughts of people from various countries in the GCC and beyond.</p><p>Due to the nature of social media platforms, we do not have demographic data about the commenters, such as age, gender, and geographical location. Social media&#x02019;s anonymity increases the chance of encountering negative or unfavorable comments. This, in turn, may lead to an overrepresentation of negative viewpoints that may not accurately reflect the beliefs of the GCC community (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Social media comments are often short and may require more in-depth analysis than other narratives to understand their meaning fully. Due to the need for more contextual information, exploring the underlying message of comments can be challenging.</p><p>Because the data is in written form, misinterpretation is possible. To address this challenge, the researchers held continuous meetings and discussions to clarify any uncertainties in the data. They have also included as many quotes as possible from the data to improve trustworthiness, maximize validity, and enhance the reader&#x02019;s interpretation.</p><p>A noted limitation of this study is the need for more triangulation. Future research should consider incorporating qualitative interviews or focus groups to gain deeper insights into the perceptions of mental health beyond online comments, particularly given the complex interplay of cultural and religious factors in the GCC.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our research highlights the lack of awareness, stigma, and insufficient resources and support for individuals dealing with mental health issues. This sheds light on the importance of addressing the barriers to mental healthcare and increasing access to resources and support for those who need it. Interventions that raise awareness and focus on reducing stigma and promoting acceptance of mental health disorders are crucial. This requires a joint effort from individuals, healthcare providers, policymakers, and religious leaders to develop and implement effective strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sec17"><title>Author&#x02019;s note</title><p>We confirm that we have thoroughly read and understood the terms of use for TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, and X regarding social media research.
