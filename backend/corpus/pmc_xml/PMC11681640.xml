AYP-101 is a newly developed injectable agent containing 93% soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC) designed to reduce submental fat. We conducted a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and lipid profile effects of AYP-101.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, two-cohort trial. Participants were randomized into groups receiving 250&#x000a0;mg of AYP-101, 500&#x000a0;mg of AYP-101, or placebo at a 9:9:8 ratio across both cohorts. Safety was assessed through standard clinical evaluations. Blood samples were collected up to 144&#x000a0;h postdose in cohort 1 and up to 48&#x000a0;h postdose in cohort 2. The PK parameters were calculated via noncompartmental analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">All 26 randomized subjects completed the study. A total of 72 solicited adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported by 24 subjects, all of which were mild. The most common ADRs were injection site pain and bruising. There were 29 ADR cases in the 250&#x000a0;mg group; 26 cases in the 500&#x000a0;mg group; and 18 cases in the placebo group, indicating that there were no clinically significant differences in the safety profiles between the groups. All the dose groups presented similar PK profiles, with C<sub>max</sub> values of 12.86, 13.44, and 13.61&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/L and AUC<sub>0&#x02212;24&#x000a0;h</sub> values of 278.06, 274.79, and 267.63&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g*h/L, respectively.

Its presence is often linked to factors such as weight, age, and lifestyle, with an observed correlation between excessive SMF and dissatisfaction with facial appearance, thereby affecting psychological well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Currently, the management of excessive SMF primarily involves two modalities: surgical interventions, such as liposuction, and nonsurgical approaches involving the use of medical devices or injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, both methods have inherent limitations. Surgical interventions may not be universally applicable due to associated risks, such as general anesthesia, bleeding, bacterial infection, and a prolonged recovery period. There is limited clinical evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of SMF removal for nonsurgical methods involving the use of medical devices, such as laser therapy. Furthermore, there is debate surrounding the role of laser treatment for fat removal, with some considering it solely adjunctive to liposuction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Another popular nonsurgical approach involves the injection of a chemical mixture of drugs into the localized fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Deoxycholic acid (DCA) has previously received global approval for reducing submental fat (SMF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, DCA is known to cause nonselective cell necrosis with hyperinflammation, which can lead to clinical symptoms such as pain, edema, and other local adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additionally, severe side effects, such as skin ulceration and nerve damage due to nonselective cell lysis, have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As a result, there is an urgent need for a new, clinically safe drug that offers comparable efficacy for reducing SMF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. AYP-101 (AMI Pharm Co., Ltd., Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea) is a novel treatment for excessive SMF that consists of high-purity soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC) extracted from soybeans. SPC is an essential phospholipid and esterified glycerophospholipid with fatty acids at positions 1 and 2 and phosphocholine at position 3. In vitro efficacy studies have shown that SPC selectively reduces adipocytes in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, suggesting its potential as a safe and effective treatment for localized SMFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. When administered without a solubilizer, SPC faces challenges related to formulation stability. Although SPC alone has a concentration-dependent effect on the dissolution of adipocytes, its low stability makes it unsuitable for maintaining quality control standards. Therefore, adding a stabilizing agent is necessary to ensure long-term dispersion in water.</p><p id="Par27">Previously, DCA was used as a solubilizer in combination with SPC. However, when injected subcutaneously alone or with SPC, DCA inhibited the selective adipocyte apoptosis and lipolysis of SPC through a nonselective cell lytic action accompanied by hyperinflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Consequently, DCA was determined to be an unsuitable solubilizer. Instead of DCA, glycocholic acid (GCA) was selected as the solubilizer for AYP-101 on the basis of previous preclinical studies. These studies indicated that GCA does not induce intrinsic effects on fat cell reduction or elevation and enhances formulation stability. Furthermore, in vitro adipocyte viability efficacy tests using SPC alone and AYP-101, an SPC injection that solubilizes SPC with GCA, revealed no statistically significant difference in adipocyte viability, and the formulation stability was superior to that of SPC alone. AYP-101, a formulation of SPC solubilized in GCA, demonstrated excellent formulation stability without compromising quality control. Moreover, it is considered an effective formulation for selective adipocyte reduction. Because there are no clinical data on AYP-101, we conducted the first-in-human study to evaluate its safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics (PK), and effects on the lipid profiles of the two groups treated with AYP-101.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study subjects</title><p id="Par28">Given that this was the first in-human study to confirm the PK properties of the investigational product, it was divided into two cohorts. The number of subjects in each cohort was determined by referencing typical phase 1 clinical trials. Subjects were selected on the basis of screening tests, which included medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.</p><p id="Par29">Eligible subjects were healthy adults aged 19&#x02013;65 years at the time of the screening. The subjects needed to have sufficient subcutaneous fat under the chin to permit a single subcutaneous injection of the investigational product into 50 points, or at least 45 points, at 1.0&#x000a0;cm grid intervals. To ensure that the subjects had sufficient subcutaneous fat, each participant was visually assessed to determine whether the designed grid pad fully covered the injection site (from the mandible to the mentum) during the screening test. Subjects were excluded if they lacked sufficient subcutaneous fat under the chin, had previously undergone cosmetic surgery, or had received injections containing SPC and DCA. Furthermore, subjects were excluded if they had a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the SPC, lidocaine, or any study-related medical devices. Patients with diseases, inflammation, wounds, or surgical scars at the injection site as well as those with a past or current history of dysphagia were also excluded.</p><p id="Par30">Written informed consent was obtained from all the subjects prior to any study-related procedure. The study was approved by the institutional review board of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (Clinical Research Information Service registration no. NCT05476094).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and drug administration</title><p id="Par31">A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, two-cohort study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and effects on the lipid profiles of the investigational products. On the basis of the time&#x02012;concentration profile observed after administering the investigational products in cohort 1, decisions were made regarding the progression to cohort 2. Adjustments were made to the study protocol for cohort 2, including modifications to the hospitalization period and blood sampling times. In cohort 1, a minimum of eight eligible subjects were planned to be enrolled without accounting for dropout rates. For cohort 2, a minimum of 18 eligible subjects were planned, considering a 20% dropout rate. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups: AYP-101 250&#x000a0;mg, AYP-101 500&#x000a0;mg, or placebo. The selection of these doses was based on ongoing multiple-dose clinical trials and preclinical efficacy studies. The subject allocation ratio was 3:3:2 for cohort 1, with a total of 8 subjects, and 1:1:1 for cohort 2, with a total of 18 subjects. The randomization code was generated via SAS (version 9.4 or higher), with the block size set to a random multiple of the number of treatment groups. Following randomization, the subjects received the investigational product subcutaneously under the chin at each dose level. The randomization codes for each group remained blinded to treatment assignment for each subject until after study completion, data lock, and central laboratory analysis to minimize bias.</p><p id="Par32">The investigational product was administered in a single session with multiple divided injections to cover the submental area. The preparation involved sterilizing pens, alcohol swabs, grid pads for marking injection sites, gauze, tape, and local anesthesia with lidocaine ointment applied to the injection site for at least 30&#x000a0;min. Subjects were briefed on potential solicited adverse events.</p><p id="Par33">The subject was administered local anesthesia with a lidocaine ointment for at least 30&#x000a0;min.

The injection site was marked with a dot to ensure that the injections were below the inferior border of the mandible. The investigational product was then injected into the broad area immediately adjacent to each marked injection site. The investigational product was then injected into submental fat tissue adjacent to marked sites, totaling 10 mL (0.2 mL per point, for a total of 50 points, with at least 45 points if insufficient) administered at 1.0&#x000a0;cm intervals with 30G needle syringes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Scheme of the injection procedure. <bold>A&#x000a0;</bold>After applying lidocaine ointment, the treated area was sanitized with an alcohol swab. <bold>B&#x000a0;</bold>A grid pad, designed with 1.0 cm intervals, was applied from the angle of the mandible down to the lower border of the mentum and the injection sites were marked as dots within the grid. <bold>C&#x000a0;</bold>After pinching the fat with two fingers, a total of 10 mL of investigational product (0.2 mL per point, for a total of 50 points, with at least 45 points if insufficient) was injected into the marked site</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12944_2024_2387_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Safety and tolerability assessments</title><p id="Par34">Safety and tolerability assessments included monitoring adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical examinations, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests.

years. Various approaches have been explored, with some focusing on DCA despite concerns about its adverse reactions. To address these concerns, we focused our attention on SPC dissolved with GCA, which offers a more selective and tolerable alternative. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the safety, PK and effects of AYP-101, a treatment for excessive submental fat in humans, on the lipid profile.</p><p id="Par52">With respect to the safety results, all AEs except for one case, in which no causal relationship with the investigational product was found, were solicited ADRs. The most common ADR observed was injection site pain, which is consistent with existing knowledge regarding agents containing essential phospholipids (referred to as SPCs in this study), which are known to induce pain, edema, and various local ADRs in adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For example, solicited ADRs such as bruising and pain at the injection site have been commonly reported with various conventional drugs that contain DCA and SPC, similar to AYP-101 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">From the perspective of severity, all the observed ADRs were mild, and the patients fully recovered without sequelae. Additionally, no other clinically significant abnormalities were observed in this study, indicating that AYP-101 was safe and well tolerated at both 250 mg and 500 mg. Many previous clinical studies of the aforementioned DCA have shown frequent ADRs in terms of safety outcomes, such as edema, bruising, pain, and numbness, similar to those of SPC but with severities ranging from mild to moderate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Notably, less frequent yet severe ADRs, including nerve damage, dysphagia, lymph node damage, alopecia, and ulceration, have also been reported in several clinical trials of DCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In light of these results, the fact that all the ADRs observed in this study were mild suggests the relatively superior safety profile of SPC.</p><p id="Par54">A trend toward a greater incidence of ADRs was subsequently observed in the AYP-101 treatment group than in the placebo group. However, no clinically significant differences in ADRs were observed between the AYP-101 250 mg and 500 mg dose groups, indicating that the dose difference between 250 mg and 500 mg did not significantly affect the incidence of ADRs. Considering its pharmacological effects for future use, AYP-101 is expected to maintain a sufficiently high level of safety at doses up to 500 mg.</p><p id="Par55">The PK results revealed no clinically significant differences between the AYP-101 250 mg and 500 mg dose groups and the placebo group. In addition, no significant differences were observed when the baseline values were compared with the postdose concentrations of AYP-101. These results indicate that a single subcutaneous administration of AYP-101 at doses of 250 mg and 500 mg resulted in a localized effect within the injection site without a further increase in systemic circulation. In comparison, DCA is known to be rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation and to increase plasma concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These results are consistent with the safety results of AYP-101, which demonstrated the absence of systemic ADRs.</p><p id="Par56">The administration of AYP-101 did not significantly affect total cholesterol, triglyceride, or free fatty acid levels, with changes within 10%. These results are consistent with the results of previous preclinical studies, including a repeated-dose toxicity test in beagle dogs, where a decrease in total cholesterol was observed within normal ranges. Similarly, the results were comparable to those of a previous clinical trial of the combination of DCA or SPC/DCA, which showed no statistically significant changes in serum lipid levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These results may indicate that subcutaneous injections of 250 mg and 500 mg of AYP-101 may have acted locally without affecting systemic lipid levels. Previous studies of subcutaneous injection of SPCs at various sites have demonstrated site-specific reductions in fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In a previous study, 10% of the subjects were nonresponders and low responders who had no or minimal change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, another possibility is that the subjects in this study may have been less responsive to the SPC.</p><p id="Par57">This study included some participants with relatively normal submental fat conditions; therefore, the results may not be generalizable to patients with excessive submental fat under the chin. The study was also limited by a lack of efficacy assessments.</p><p id="Par58">However, our study demonstrated that AYP-101 has a promising safety profile, with only mild and expected side effects observed at both the 250 mg and 500 mg dosages. These findings may offer advantages over traditional treatments, which are known to increase the risk of severe ADRs such as DCA. The favorable safety profile of AYP-101 underscores the need for future late-phase studies in larger and more diverse populations, including obese patients with substantial submental fat, and various study methods, including imaging technology, for accurately assessing the efficacy of submental fat reduction and the localized effects of AYP-101.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par59">In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate the excellent safety and tolerability of the newly developed SPC formulation AYP-101 at doses of 250 mg and 500 mg. Moreover, the administration of AYP-101 via subcutaneous injection under the chin resulted in minimal systemic exposure, further confirming its safety profile. These results highlight the promising potential of AYP-101 as a therapeutic agent and are anticipated to provide valuable insights for future clinicians and patients who are using SPC-like drugs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
