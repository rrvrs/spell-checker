High numbers of children and young people are living with obesity and experience significant physical and mental health impacts. Social prescribing research has shown it can help improve young people&#x02019;s physical and mental health, meaning it may be a helpful way to provide additional, personalised support to young people who are living with obesity, and to help to address the health inequalities experienced by this group. This study aimed to provide an overview of the current understanding and use of social prescribing from healthcare professionals working in specialist weight management services in England, and to identify perceived benefits and barriers to future implementation of social prescribing in these services.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A national survey was distributed online between April and July 2023 to healthcare professionals working within specialist weight management clinics across England to gather information regarding their current use and understanding of social prescribing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Thirty-eight completed surveys were analysed, with good representation from services across England. Staff felt they had an understanding of what social prescribing is and were willing to use it. Anticipated benefits included improvements to wellbeing and providing opportunities for physical activity and family support. Reported barriers included limited capacity from staff and a need for more training around how to identify appropriate community-based services to link with.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Healthcare professionals working in children&#x02019;s weight management services felt social prescribing could be beneficial for the families they worked with. However, to support implementation in their services, there is a need for further resource, such as staff time and training, to help develop relationships between clinical services and community-based services.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>Young people</kwd><kwd>Social prescribing</kwd><kwd>Weight management</kwd><kwd>Obesity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010035</institution-id><institution>Sheffield Hallam University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Obesity</title><p id="Par5">Childhood obesity is a major public health challenge worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] with estimates that almost 20% of 5&#x02013;19 year olds were living with overweight or obesity in 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In England, data from the National Child Measurement Programme 2023/24 reports 9.6% of children aged 4&#x02013;5 years and 22.1% of children aged 10&#x02013;11 years are living with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This data also suggests that this group experiences significant health inequalities, with children living in the most deprived areas of England being more likely to be living with obesity with a prevalence rate of at least double that experienced by children living in less deprived areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Excess weight in childhood has been linked to a range of significant physical health impacts such as cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and musculoskeletal issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] as well as mental health challenges, such as low self-esteem and low self-confidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Many of these physical and mental health impacts can continue into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] with significant cost to health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Obesity is therefore a key health priority to address, and in England, there are targets to reduce rates of obesity included in the National Health Service (NHS) Long Term Plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Models of weight management support across England have been organised into four Tiers depending on the type of support offered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. NICE guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] recommends support approaches should be tailored to the needs of families, by developing services with input from local community engagement and multidisciplinary healthcare teams.</p><p id="Par8">Tier 1 services include universal public health measures, such as national healthy lifestyle campaigns and advice from professionals like GPs and school nurses. Referrals can be made to Tier 2 services if a family needs further support, and these services include community weight management programmes generally consisting of time-limited, group courses focusing on lifestyle changes. Tier 3 services are more intensive weight management programmes delivered by a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals (including consultants, nurses, dieticians, nutritionists, physiotherapists, psychologists) and a focus on underlying issues such as mental health difficulties. They are recommended when additional support is needed after accessing Tier 2 services, after relapse, or if an individual experiences significant co-morbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Tier 4 services include more intensive surgical and non-surgical medical treatments.</p><p id="Par9">Despite high levels of need, nationally, there are no formal standards and limited availability of services for children and young people at Tier 3 level. In response, in 2022, NHS England commissioned twenty-one Complications from Excess Weight (CEW) clinics to provide support to CYP living with severe obesity at Tier 3 level. This has been increased to up to forty-three clinics from 2024. These CEW clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] support children and young people aged under 18 years who have or are at risk of developing significant complications related to their weight, and who need further support after accessing Tier 2 services. The CEW clinics are built on a biopsychosocial and holistic approach, aiming to consider underlying factors which may contribute to the development of severe obesity including mental health, physical health, and social needs. The delivery models at each of the clinics vary based on local needs but each aim to create holistic, person-centred packages of care for families. There is a recognised need for this care to be personalised, acceptable and accessible to all families, and many clinics employ support workers who can provide additional home visits and community-based support to families.</p><p id="Par10">Whilst a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals is essential to providing care for families at Tier 3 level, to improve long term outcomes there is also a need for families to be able to access ongoing and sustained support outside of the clinic environment, such as at home or in their local communities. For example, for accessing low level mental health support and opportunities for physical activity, it is possible for community-based services to provide this in non-stigmatising, accessible locations, with reduced waiting lists, and long term support which can continue after clinic-based treatment has ended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This has the potential to be achieved through social prescribing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Social prescribing</title><p id="Par11">Social prescribing involves healthcare professionals referring patients to community-based services to support them with their wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These services can include (but are not limited to) activities such as sports, crafts, volunteering, or gaming groups. This process often works through referral to a &#x02018;link worker&#x02019; who provides holistic support and a patient-centred, flexible approach to support an individual to choose and access a community service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Whilst social prescribing was originally implemented in healthcare services in the United Kingdom (UK), it has since become a global concept, with social prescribing initiatives reported in over 30 countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. There is an International Social Prescribing Collaborative, with ambitions to share learning across countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">In the UK there has been increasing interest and investment in social prescribing over recent years, with commitments to embed social prescribing services and link workers into Primary Care Networks outlined in the NHS Long Term Plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In adult populations, research has found positive results from social prescribing in terms of improvements to wellbeing, reductions in A&#x00026;E attendances and reduced demand for GP services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, there have been calls for more robust research in this area to build a more definitive evidence base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], with current studies often showing wide variation in delivery models and poor evaluation design, which limits conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">For social prescribing with children and young people, the evidence base has increased over recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A recent systematic review highlighted preliminary evidence to suggest improvements to wellbeing, and a favourable return on investment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] although these studies only included those over 15 years old. These findings align with reports which demonstrate improvements for young people&#x02019;s mental health, reductions in social isolation, and wider benefits such as reduced health inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Social prescribing programmes can also provide regular and sustainable opportunities for physical activity, in an accessible and non-stigmatising environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Families accessing CEW clinics often experience complex social challenges and are living in more deprived areas of the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In particular, young people living with severe obesity commonly experience low mood and low self-esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Based on the understanding that social prescribing is a holistic, person-centred form of support, which can support young people with their mental health, reduce isolation, provide accessible opportunities for physical activity and develop confidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], social prescribing may be a helpful way to provide additional ongoing, accessible support to young people alongside CEW clinic treatment.</p><p id="Par16">Currently, social prescribing programmes are not formally included in the CEW clinic pathway for children and young people. All Primary Care Networks in England offer an all age link worker resource but youth social prescribing provision varies significantly across local areas. This current paper details a national survey for professionals working in CEW services. The aim was to understand if there were any examples of social prescribing programmes across clinics, as well as to gather professionals&#x02019; understanding of social prescribing and potential barriers and needs for implementation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design</title><p id="Par17">This study used a cross-sectional, quantitative survey design, with data collected from professionals working as part of Complications of Excess Weight (CEW) clinics across England.

The survey was initially distributed via email by a consultant working within the CEW clinics and a researcher, with a reminder sent two weeks later. A final reminder was sent a month later, two weeks before the survey closed. The initial email distribution list contained approximately 130 contacts. The survey was also shared with contacts at NHS England CEW delivery board meetings and through networks of dietetics and psychologists working at CEW clinics. Respondents were staff working with children and young people (aged 2&#x02013;18 years old) living with obesity, as part of a CEW clinic.</p><p id="Par23">The first page of the survey provided information about the study, including its scope and aims, and contact details for the researcher. Participants were informed that they could contact the researcher with any questions they had about the research. An information sheet was available to read and download, and consent was required to be provided before the survey could be accessed. The survey was expected to take no more than 10&#x000a0;min to complete. The survey was live for four months, between April and July 2023.</p><p id="Par24">Participants remained anonymous and were not required to provide their name or any contact details.

</p><p id="Par46">Almost a quarter (24%) of respondents felt they needed better contact and communication with community-based groups. 19% also identified a need for a link worker or similar role to support with referrals and 18% wanted more training on how to use social prescribing.</p><p id="Par47">When asked if they knew which community-based services they could refer young people to in their local area, responses were equally split between &#x02018;yes&#x02019; (29%), &#x02018;no&#x02019; (26%) and &#x02018;not sure&#x02019; (24%). Eight professionals provided additional comments, most commonly reporting they felt they knew some community-based services but needed to know more and identifying challenges around having time and capacity to find these, particularly when their service provided care across large areas (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6).</p><p id="Par48">Final additional comments to the survey as a whole were provided by seven professionals. These generally highlighted issues around knowing what community-based services are available and identifying a lack of services specifically for children and young people (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par49">Social prescribing is gaining recognition and becoming more commonly implemented globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and within the UK, increasingly for children and young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Despite this, social prescribing is not consistently integrated across all clinical services and has not yet been explored in specialist services such as children&#x02019;s weight management. This survey provides an overview of the current understanding and use of social prescribing in specialist weight management clinics for children and young people (specifically &#x02018;Complications from Excess Weight&#x02019; CEW clinics) across England, as well as perceived benefits and barriers to future implementation.</p><p id="Par50">The increase in use of social prescribing across UK services may be reflected in the survey results, with responses showing that the majority of professionals had heard of social prescribing and understood what it involved. Descriptive responses consistently mentioned &#x02018;non-medical&#x02019; support and outcomes relating to meeting wider wellbeing and lifestyle needs of families. This aligns with the wider evidence base, which shows an increase in studies of social prescribing in recent years with focus on wellbeing outcomes such as mental health support and reduced isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Professionals&#x02019; descriptions of social prescribing generally focused on a direct referral method, with professionals referring to community-based services, rather than referring on to a &#x02018;link worker&#x02019; or similar role. Only one respondent mentioned referral to a local service which then connects families to community groups, more similar to a link worker model of social prescribing. This may reflect that whilst primary care networks now offer some level of access to a social prescribing link worker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">31</xref>], access may still be limited specifically for children and young people. This means that professionals are often referring direct to community-based services they know, with more of a &#x02018;signposting&#x02019; approach, rather than to a dedicated link worker who can support this process. Social prescribing can still work through a direct approach, with professionals connecting families to services they know and trust. However, link workers often have a wider knowledge of local services that are available, meaning they may be able to offer the young person more choice over which service they access, or help find a service that is more tailored to the young person&#x02019;s needs and interests. In addition, link workers may have more capacity to support the young person to access this service, either through increasing their confidence to attend a new group or by supporting with practical aspects, such as how to travel to the group.</p><p id="Par52">Although social prescribing has not yet been formally implemented in the UK to support young people living with severe obesity, there was recognition from professionals that this would be beneficial. Over 80% of professionals thought social prescribing would be helpful for the young people they worked with, and that they would be likely to use it in future. The main identified areas of benefit focused around developing self-esteem and confidence and providing opportunities for physical activity and family support, which involved working with young people and parents/carers together. Similarly, the current evidence for social prescribing with children and young people suggests improvements for confidence, self-esteem, and reduced isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In terms of weight management, community-based treatments and family approaches also show high levels of promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">The potential benefits of social prescribing, particularly developing confidence and providing opportunities for physical activity, were also reflected in the examples professionals provided of services they refer families to. Just over half of respondents felt they were using social prescribing in their role, mainly through direct referrals to local community groups or leisure centres and gyms which provided opportunities for physical activity. In a recent social prescribing study for young people accessing mental health services, group physical activity was shown to help facilitate development of trusting relationships and also facilitate improvements to mental wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">The main barriers professionals faced in using social prescribing in their role were related to not knowing the available community-based services to collaborate with and there was a reported need for an additional role in their service to support with this, such as a link worker. However, not knowing the available local services may not be due to a lack of time and capacity but may be due to a lack of suitable community-based services that are ready to be part of a social prescribing offer. Professionals felt there was a lack of services for younger children, with many being adult-focused or targeted at those over 18 years. This is reflected in the literature, with the most recent systematic review of social prescribing for children and young people finding included studies commonly included those over 15 years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. There may therefore be a gap in provision of suitable community-based services, limiting the potential for collaboration between healthcare providers and community organisations through social prescribing. This aligns with reports which call for increased investment into youth services to support the delivery of social prescribing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Free text comments throughout the survey emphasised the workload involved in developing an understanding of what community-based services exist and to develop connections with them. This is an important process, as healthcare staff need to have trust in the services that they are referring service users to, and community-based services need to trust and have good working relationships with the clinical services they take referrals from to support collaborative working [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Mapping work has been undertaken in one CEW clinic locality to identify local community-based services that are suitable for this population. Findings from this work are published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and show the time and resource this mapping work required, as well as the limited availability of community-based services that meet the specific needs of this population. In practice, it may be that this work to map and develop links with community-based services could be undertaken by link workers embedded into the CEW service.</p><p id="Par56">In this current survey, professionals highlighted that this mapping work was often the role of a family support worker, youth worker or social worker, although not all CEW clinics will have this role included in their multidisciplinary team. It is important that training is provided to support social prescribing with 18% of professionals who completed the survey stating training was needed to support implementation. Current training for link workers who deliver social prescribing can be variable across areas but often includes e-learning modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This e-learning is all-age focused and therefore is unlikely to include sufficient detail to reflect the complexity of working with young people, or with those with specific additional needs, such as for those living with obesity. It is currently targeted at NHS staff, meaning this training is less accessible for those working in community-based services.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Recommendations</title><p id="Par57">Findings from the survey have been able to inform recommendations for policy and practice for developing a social prescribing offer within weight management services for children and young people. The challenge highlighted by staff in identifying appropriate local community-based services may reflect a lack of available services that meet the needs of young people living with obesity, but it may also be that more support for community services is required, especially if these services are expected to support young people with complex needs. Support for community services, such as increased staff capacity, funding, training and supervision should therefore be considered. Additionally, embedding a youth specific link worker into the clinical multidisciplinary team may increase capacity to develop connections with local community services and provide support to families to access these.</p><p id="Par58">CEW staff reported that social prescribing could support families with developing confidence, providing opportunities for physical activity and family support. Therefore, a social prescribing offer within weight management services should focus on addressing wider, holistic goals, such as mental health and self-esteem rather than focusing solely on physical health outcomes or weight change. This aligns with NICE guidelines which recommend involvement in physical activity, not only to lose weight but also because of the wider benefits this can provide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Developing guidance and training for clinical staff around what social prescribing is, what benefits it can offer, and which families it works best for can help to develop understanding and trust in the service, and support implementation. This has been noted by other social prescribing studies in hospital settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par59">The current survey was limited by a small sample size, with 38 full completions of the survey. Despite this, there was good distribution across sites nationally, as well as across roles within the CEW clinics. The aims of the survey were able to be achieved, by providing a current overview of CEW professionals&#x02019; understanding of and attitudes to social prescribing in their service.</p><p id="Par60">This current study focused on children&#x02019;s weight management services within England, meaning findings may not be fully generalisable to other countries, especially given the complexities involved in childhood obesity and variations in healthcare services. However, the findings from this study provide insights into the application of social prescribing to this population and an understanding of potential barriers and needs to support implementation. As childhood obesity is increasingly a global issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], alongside the increasing international interest in social prescribing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], this study provides insights into potential application of social prescribing for this population, which will be of use to healthcare professionals and researchers working within this field across different countries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par61">Social prescribing is gaining recognition globally as a way to offer individuals additional, holistic support with their health and wellbeing. Social prescribing could be beneficial for supporting young people living with obesity and their families, particularly in terms of improving wellbeing, providing opportunities for physical activity, and providing family support. However, to allow for implementation into services, there is a need for resource to support this. This support is needed both in terms of investment into community-based services specifically for children and young people, and staff time and training for both clinical and community-based services to support collaboration. Embedding and connecting youth link workers into specialist healthcare services could be explored as a way to support implementation of social prescribing for young people living with obesity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Conception of the study (MG, CH, CD, LD, KP, NW).
