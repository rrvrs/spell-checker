Opportunistic networks have emerged as a possible solution in such scenarios, allowing for intermittent and decentralized data sharing. This article presents a novel communication protocol that uses Bluetooth 5 and the libp2p framework to enable decentralized and opportunistic communications among IoT devices. The protocol provides dynamic peer discovery and decentralized management, resulting in a more flexible and robust IoT network infrastructure. The performance of the proposed architecture was evaluated through experiments in both controlled and industrial scenarios, with a particular emphasis on latency and on the impact of the presence of obstacles. The obtained results show that the protocol has the ability to improve data transfer in environments with limited connectivity, making it adequate for both urban and rural areas, as well as for challenging environments such as shipyards. Moreover, the presented findings conclude that the protocol works well in situations with minimal signal obstruction and short distances, like homes, where average latency values of about 8 s have been achieved with no losses. Furthermore, the protocol can also be used in industrial scenarios, even when metal obstacles increase signal attenuation, and over long distances, where average latency values of about 8.5 s have been obtained together with packet losses of less than 5%.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>opportunistic networks</kwd><kwd>opportunistic edge computing</kwd><kwd>OEC systems</kwd><kwd>opportunistic IoT</kwd><kwd>Bluetooth 5</kwd><kwd>decentralized IoT</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Centro Mixto de Investigaci&#x000f3;n UDC-NAVANTIA</funding-source><award-id>IN853C 2022/01</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>GAIN (Xunta de Galicia)</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>ERDF Galicia 2021&#x02013;2027</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033</funding-source><award-id>PID2020-118857RA-100 (ORBALLO)</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work has been supported by Centro Mixto de Investigaci&#x000f3;n UDC-NAVANTIA (IN853C 2022/01), funded by GAIN (Xunta de Galicia) and ERDF Galicia 2021&#x02013;2027.

Introduction</title><p>In recent years, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices that require connectivity to function properly has grown, demanding the development of more efficient networks [<xref rid="B1-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Opportunistic networks, which allow for the intermittent and temporary sharing of information among devices [<xref rid="B2-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], have achieved increased importance and are considered a viable option for areas where continuous connectivity is not guaranteed and traditional network infrastructure may be compromised, such as rural areas [<xref rid="B4-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], congested urban areas, or emergency situations such as natural disasters [<xref rid="B5-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Opportunistic networks are a useful alternative when continuous access, whether to the Internet or to a Local Area Network (LAN), is missing [<xref rid="B6-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These networks allow for effective data sharing and routing even in the lack of constant connectivity. They also help to overcome some of the constraints associated with Cloud Computing, such as scalability, lack of security mechanisms for resource-limited devices, and excessive energy consumption [<xref rid="B2-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To enhance Cloud Computing, technologies such as Edge Computing have emerged [<xref rid="B7-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. When combined with opportunistic networks, they allow for creating Opportunistic Edge Computing (OEC) systems, which provide Edge Computing services in an opportunistic way [<xref rid="B8-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Bluetooth stands out as one of the most used technologies in the field of IoT [<xref rid="B10-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For instance, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been developed as one of the most energy-efficient wireless communication technologies, with a high transmission&#x02013;energy ratio [<xref rid="B12-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. BLE Mesh allows for completely decentralized operation [<xref rid="B13-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with advertising for node communications, making it ideal for opportunistic communications. Despite these characteristics, it has certain limitations [<xref rid="B14-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It requires continuous activity to maintain the mesh network, which usually involves increasing power usage.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Messages have to go through numerous nodes before reaching their destination.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Network congestion may occur in environments with high node density.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The limited memory and processing resources of some nodes may lead to making it more difficult to manage the complexity of the network.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Large volumes of high-speed data cannot be sent without latency limitations.</p></list-item></list></p><p>This article describes a communication protocol based on libp2p [<xref rid="B16-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Bluetooth Mesh for two different home IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT) scenarios. The developed protocol enables decentralized and opportunistic communication among nodes so that each node acts both as a client and a server, allowing for direct data exchange between them, as well as taking advantage of communication opportunities that arise in a dynamic and non-predefined way.</p><p>The following are the main contributions of this article:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, this is the first article that demonstrates the use of Bluetooth 5 in combination with libp2p for implementing practical opportunistic networks.

Background Work</title><sec id="sec2dot1-sensors-25-01190"><title>2.1. Previous Work</title><p>Opportunistic systems have been previously discussed in [<xref rid="B2-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B18-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], where their essential parts are described. Specifically, such papers indicate that an OEC system is defined as a decentralized and adaptable architecture that allows IoT/IIoT devices to take advantage of computing, storage, and communication resources available in their nearby environment without relying on continuous connectivity or predefined infrastructure. Its operation is based on the ability to dynamically detect and use nearby nodes or gateways (static or mobile) to execute critical tasks in the absence of stable network coverage.</p><p>In order to clarify how an opportunistic system works, an example of a generic architecture is shown in <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. At the bottom, the IoT network layer is composed of different IoT networks whose end devices are capable of exchanging data with the upper layer. Such end devices can also communicate with other devices in their same network, thus acting as relays. What distinguishes the IoT network layer from other layers present in generic IoT architectures is the fact that the communications with the upper layer are not always possible, so they need to be carried out opportunistically. Therefore, the upper layer (labeled in <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> as OEC Smart Gateway Layer) is made up of gateways capable of providing services opportunistically with reduced latency, thanks to their proximity to the IoT end nodes. Moreover, the proposed architecture allows the received data to be stored in a distributed manner among all the gateways. Finally, the Cloud provides services that gateways cannot provide, such as intensive processing or the storage of large amounts of data.</p><p>An example of the use of the previously described communications architecture is detailed in [<xref rid="B2-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Such a paper proposes an OEC system in which IoT devices deployed in remote areas or with limited connectivity (e.g., environmental or industrial sensors) use Bluetooth 5 to dynamically connect to edge gateways based on Single-Board Computers (SBCs) (e.g., Raspberry Pi) when these are within their communication range. Equipped with Bluetooth 5 modules and WiFi/4G connectivity, such gateways act as intermediary nodes that provide local storage and processing services, reducing the dependency on a continuous Internet connection. The system employs a peer-to-peer (P2P) network based on Kademlia DHT to store data on other nearby gateways or route them to available destinations, ensuring service continuity even when a node loses its connectivity and data locally. The communication between gateways is primarily performed via WiFi or 4G networks, but in the event of interruptions, the system turns to the Cloud as a backup to maintain connectivity between geographically dispersed IoT networks.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-sensors-25-01190"><title>2.2. Disaster Relief Use Case</title><p>To illustrate the use of opportunistic systems, the example of a disaster relief scenario related to a flood is shown in <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. In such a situation, the environment is rapidly affected by the flood, so quick decisions need to be made. To tackle these issues, it is assumed that there are IoT sensors deployed across the scenario to detect the water level. Such sensors monitor risk conditions characterized by high water levels or heavy rains and are connected to gateways that enable sending the collected information to servers located in a remote Cloud, where it is analyzed to send alerts. However, in the case of a flood, the connectivity of the deployed IoT water level sensors can be affected, making it not possible to send the data to the Cloud (step 1 in <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Nonetheless, when using an opportunistic system, devices like drones, wearables, or mobile phones can act opportunistically as mobile OEC Gateways to collect information from the sensors (step 2) or provide them with Edge Computing services. It is important to note that, in the event that one of the OEC gateways fails or when a connection cannot be established with an OEC gateway, it would be necessary to wait for another mobile node to appear opportunistically to reestablish the connection. Thus, once one OEC gateway collects the information, it is routed through the network infrastructure, being replicated among all the gateways (step 3) until reaching the one that can connect to the Cloud (step 4). The Cloud can then carry out the necessary actions, such as activating the flood alert system (step 5) or sending alerts to the remote users closest to the affected area (step 6) (these latter actions can also be performed in an opportunistic way, but, for the sake of clarity of <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, they are represented as direct actions).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-sensors-25-01190"><title>2.3. Analysis of the State of the Art</title><p>Opportunistic communication networks have become a viable option in recent decades for situations where standard connectivity is either nonexistent or severely constrained [<xref rid="B21-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These systems make use of connection opportunities in dynamic and irregular connectivity environments by enabling direct communications between mobile devices and other nodes. As technology develops, a variety of applications in crucial fields like disaster relief [<xref rid="B5-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], environmental monitoring [<xref rid="B4-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and people tracking [<xref rid="B22-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] are made possible by the combination of opportunistic networks with cutting-edge technologies like IoT, mobile Edge Computing (MEC), or 6G networks.</p><p>In the past, some researchers have focused on the design and optimization of communication protocols and routing techniques for opportunistic networks. Specifically, some researchers analyzed how routing protocols and communication approaches might be improved to respond to the changing conditions of opportunistic networks. For instance, in [<xref rid="B23-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the authors describe a forwarding factor routing protocol that enhances data forwarding by dynamically choosing nodes based on their forwarding capabilities, which are influenced by various parameters including node mobility and network structure. Compared with static routing systems, the authors&#x02019; techniques improve data delivery rates and reduce latency, which makes them suitable for IoT scenarios with high mobility and fluctuating node density. Recent work on information freshness (Age of Information, AoI) optimization, such as [<xref rid="B24-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], demonstrates how time-modulated arrays can prioritize time-sensitive data in covert communications, a concept relevant to opportunistic networks where minimizing AoI is critical for applications like disaster response or real-time monitoring. In addition, in [<xref rid="B25-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], a technique is presented that considers node energy levels and connection stability to make a dynamic selection of forwarding nodes, decreasing energy usage, extending network useful life, and assuring reliable data transmission. Another interesting work is described in [<xref rid="B4-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], where a fuzzy Q-learning algorithm is applied to vehicular crowdsensing networks, enhanced by MEC. Integrating fuzzy logic with Q-learning allows for more sophisticated routing and data dissemination decisions, taking into account elements such as vehicle speed, direction, and network connectivity. Finally, it is also worth mentioning that there are emerging frameworks for integrated sensing and communications, like the tensor-based approach described in [<xref rid="B26-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which unifies channel estimation and target detection in massive MIMO systems, providing insights into how opportunistic networks could dynamically adapt RF parameters (e.g., transmit power, beamforming) to improve reliability in unstable environments.</p><p>Other articles examine the integration of opportunistic communication systems with advanced technologies such as 6G, MEC, or blockchain to enhance their capabilities and applications. For example, in [<xref rid="B5-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the authors utilize 6G networks to enhance the responsiveness and effectiveness of rescue operations for drone-based disaster response. In [<xref rid="B27-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], blockchain technology is integrated into IoT networks using opportunistic block validation to enhance security and trust, utilizing the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain. Moreover, in [<xref rid="B28-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the authors explore how opportunistic networking principles can be integrated into IoT systems for smart city applications to improve connectivity and data sharing. Such a study highlights the potential of opportunistic communications to improve network scalability, to reduce infrastructure costs, and to enhance the overall performance of IoT deployments.</p><p>Other articles provide comprehensive evaluations, highlighting difficulties, significance, and prospective applications for opportunistic networks. For instance, in [<xref rid="B29-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], important challenges such as irregular connectivity and the need for effective routing strategies are discussed. Such a paper also emphasizes the importance of opportunistic networks in situations where traditional networks are unavailable or overloaded, such as in disaster zones or densely populated urban regions. Despite substantial progress, the paper indicates that universal deployment has not been achieved and recommends continued research into new use cases and integration with emerging technologies such as 5G and IoT. Related to the previous article, in [<xref rid="B30-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] the authors utilize wireless network identifiers (beacons) for information dissemination in opportunistic networks. This solution makes use of existing wireless network infrastructure, such as Wi-Fi or BLE, to transmit messages without requiring active connections. It is especially useful in situations requiring quick information circulation, such as emergency notifications or public announcements.</p><p>With respect to Bluetooth, research has been carried out on how to apply and optimize BLE for opportunistic networking, with an emphasis on data dissemination and energy efficiency. For instance, a mesh network protocol using BLE technology is presented in [<xref rid="B31-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and is aimed at smart homes, IoT, and industrial automation. It makes use of the publish/subscribe paradigm, which enables nodes to accept data from publishers and to subscribe to certain types of messages. Other authors have made use of BLE for opportunistic networking, as in [<xref rid="B32-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which describes techniques to improve data dissemination and to decrease energy consumption by making effective use of BLE advertising and scanning modes. Similarly to opportunistic networks, the proposed protocol ensures efficient data exchange even in situations with sporadic connections.</p><p>After reviewing the current state of the art, it can be concluded that the previously mentioned studies have been mostly focused on simulations and on the theoretical part, providing barely any experimental evaluation in real-world scenarios. Moreover, few fully address security and privacy concerns, and there is little emphasis on integrating emerging technologies like Bluetooth Mesh with opportunistic networks.</p><p>In contrast, this article provides both a theoretical description and a practical validation in real scenarios, including specific details on security, privacy, and novel strategies to optimize power consumption in BLE devices. Furthermore, this work also focuses on making opportunistic networks more robust and adaptable to changing conditions, such as poor coverage situations, which fills an important gap in the existing literature.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-sensors-25-01190"><title>3.

Gateways communicate with each other, allowing data to flow dynamically and flexibly. This communication between gateways enables creating a distributed network that can operate even if part of the network loses its connectivity.

Bridge</title><p>The Bridge interconnects libp2p with the Bluetooth transport layer. In order to perform such an interconnection, it creates a process that listens and writes to the serial port; in this way, the messages required for the libp2p connection travel over the Bridge and are transmitted to the Bluetooth module via the serial port.</p><sec id="sec4dot3dot1-sensors-25-01190"><title>4.3.1.

Moreover, the messages range in size from 20 to 2000 bytes, but the proposed Bluetooth transportation layer can only send 255 bytes, so messages need to be split in segments. To avoid saturating the channel, each segment is queued and broadcast with a specific delay. In addition to the message start and end characters, each segment contains a header that indicates the entire size of the unfragmented message, which is eventually processed by the receiver. <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> illustrates the internal structure of the frame, which contains the following fields:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Header (13 bytes): it contains the message header, which includes the information necessary to send the message through the OEC protocol.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Dst (6 bytes): it contains the destination ID, which identifies the node to which the message is addressed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Start Char (2 bytes): it indicates the start of the message character, which serves as a delimiter so that the receiver knows where the message content begins.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Data (1&#x02013;227 bytes): payload of the message.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Length (4 bytes): actual length of the message so that reception can determine whether the message has arrived complete.</p></list-item><list-item><p>End Char (3 bytes): it indicates the end of the message character, which serves as a delimiter so that the receiver knows where the frame ends.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3dot2-sensors-25-01190"><title>4.3.2.

It is not necessary to verify the integrity of the data at this point since this verification is performed at another level of the proposed opportunistic stack; specifically, libp2p is responsible for this verification once the data are decoded.

Bluetooth Transport Layer</title><p>The Bluetooth networking protocol depends on the Bluetooth Transport Layer to provide communications between the mobile nodes and readers that serve as Bluetooth Mesh Clients. Large-scale networks may benefit greatly from the wireless mesh topology that a Bluetooth Mesh network offers, as it allows various devices or nodes to connect and to interact. Using the mentioned mesh clients makes it easier to discover peers without needing a central node to which all nodes must be connected to route messages. In this case, to find a peer, the node only has to send a broadcast message so that the rest of the clients provisioned in the same network know that they are available for the connection. In this way, they can start the connection, and the relationship between the peer ID and the mesh client ID will be stored in a table.

Key among them is adaptability to perpetual changes in the network; the rapid entry and exit of nodes makes it difficult to maintain effective connections and routes, often increasing the time and resources needed to reestablish them when they are lost. Furthermore, peer discovery, which is crucial in such networks, can be very expensive in terms of bandwidth and energy, especially in dense or heterogeneous networks where nodes use different transport technologies.</p><p>Routing challenges also present significant challenges; libp2p algorithms may not be fast and efficient enough in environments where routes change too frequently, potentially introducing latency or redundancy in message propagation. Resource consumption is another major limitation, as libp2p can be demanding in terms of energy and computational capacity, especially on IoT devices that have limited batteries and processing capabilities.</p><p>Due to these limitations, it has been decided to delegate peer discovery to Bluetooth Mesh, while libp2p would be responsible for managing global connectivity and routing in the network.

One of the most important settings is the duration of the gap between two successive segments in segmented messages (both transmitting and receiving), which is determined by the following two formulas:<disp-formula id="FD2-sensors-25-01190"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="mm2" display="block" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable displaystyle="true"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="right"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>_</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>_</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>_</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02217;</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="right"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>_</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>_</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>_</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02217;</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p><italic toggle="yes">Tx<sub>seg_int_step</sub></italic> controls the interval between sending two consecutive segments in a segmented message, and <italic toggle="yes">Rx<sub>seg_int_step</sub></italic> defines the segment reception interval step used for delaying the transmission of an acknowledgment message after receiving a new segment. By default, both variables are equal to 5 ms, implying a period of 60 ms between segment transmission/reception. When applied to a maximum of 32 segments, this corresponds to a time of 1920 ms, assuming that no further messages are utilized in the communication. However, by default, the number of additional resends is two, so the default periods would be significantly longer. These times greater than one second are quite similar to what is obtained when message sending is decoupled from the designed protocol, though buffers and caches are used to reduce the number of performed transmissions, so these times are not exact, but they provide an approximation. In this case the forwarding factor is more critical, since all the segments that make up the messages are forwarded.</p><p>Taking into account the opportunistic nature of some nodes, they could benefit from adjusting the previously described times in order to minimize the use of the radio module and thus consumption, as a constant traffic flow is not necessary. However, it is necessary to determine an optimal adjustment for the previously mentioned time parameters, since a reduction in the intervals can lead to collisions and to the need for retransmitting the segment (by default, one retransmission is used for unicast addresses and two for multicast). In opportunistic environments with low data traffic, a minor change to these intervals can result in significant time improvements.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5-sensors-25-01190"><title>5. Experiments</title><p>The tests presented in the next sections were designed to validate the functionality of the proposed protocol in a controlled static environment, such as the inside of a home, and in an industrial environment, such as the interior of shipyard workhouses. The showcased use cases involved the exchange of messages between two nodes, with one acting as the sender and the other one as the receiver. Specifically, during these experiments, we have focused on latency measurement. The choice of latency as a priority metric is based on its direct impact on the effectiveness of critical IoT applications, where data must reach their destination within narrow time windows to trigger timely responses. In scenarios such as disaster response, the timing of data reception plays an important role in the decision-making process. In opportunistic networks that allow messages to be sent even when there is a temporary disconnection and where the arrangement of nodes changes frequently, it is crucial to minimize latency so that there is enough time for the message to reach its destination before the connection times out. For the first experiment, a total of four tests were carried out, each with 100 packets transmitted with a transmission time of 9 s between each message. The objective was to see how different locations impacted latency and the number of lost packets. All source code needed to replicate the presented experiments is available online [<xref rid="B43-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], allowing any researcher to use and further extend the developed OEC system.</p><sec id="sec5dot1-sensors-25-01190"><title>5.1. Experimental Testbed</title><p>An experimental testbed was built to assess the performance of the proposed OEC system. The elements of such a testbed were two nodes built on a Raspberry Pi 3B single-board computer (SBC) with a Nordic nRF52840 development kit [<xref rid="B44-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] linked via serial port to enable Bluetooth Mesh functionality. <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> depicts one of such nodes. After the developed software was flashed onto the nodes, the Nordic nRF Mesh app for Android was used to provision and configure the nodes. <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f011" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref> shows two screenshots of nodes provisioned through the app. Two nodes that have already been provisioned are shown on the left (&#x0201c;0&#x000d7;0027&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;0&#x000d7;0023&#x0201d;), and the configuration of one of them, on the right, where a key has been linked and the publish and subscribe settings have been set up. This experiment was carried out by creating the group &#x0201c;0&#x000d7;C000&#x0201d;, where each node is configured to both publish and subscribe, enabling only the nodes that are subscribed to that group to view the content that they publish.</p><p>The Bluetooth Mesh provisioning controller handles provisioning for Nordic development kits. It supports four alternative out-of-band (OOB) authentication methods and uses the Hardware Information driver to generate a deterministic UUID that identifies the device.</p></sec><sec id="sec5dot2-sensors-25-01190"><title>5.2. Home Automation Experiments</title><p>The first set of tests was carried out in a static indoor environment, as shown in <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f012" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>, which represents the interior of a home, where there were typical barriers, such as walls and furniture. The distances between the deployed nodes were receiving (4&#x02013;6 m). <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f012" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref> shows on a floor plan the four different positions where the receiving node (in red) was deployed around the environment and only one position for the sender (in green), which was utilized to send data packets to each node.</p><sec><title>Communications Latency</title><p><xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f013" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref>, <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f014" ref-type="fig">Figure 14</xref>, <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f015" ref-type="fig">Figure 15</xref> and <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f016" ref-type="fig">Figure 16</xref> show the communications latency of messages transmitted using the developed protocol at 9 s intervals from four distinct places in a house: the kitchen, the entrance, the living room, and the bedroom. On the one hand, <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f013" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref> and <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f014" ref-type="fig">Figure 14</xref> show slightly more stable behavior than for the other two locations. It is worth noting that in all the performed experiments, there is a peak around packet 60, indicated by vertical red lines in <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f013" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref>. After checking the connection logs and ruling out possible connectivity failures, it can be confirmed that this peak occurs because after a certain number of minutes, the protocol verifies whether the communication is still active, which causes a delay in the remaining packets. Notwithstanding this anomaly, there are hardly any spikes in latency (i.e., latency variability is low). The typical delay is approximately 8 to 8.5 s. This suggests that both locations benefit from better signal propagation conditions, possibly due to fewer obstacles and shorter distances to the transmission point. On the other hand, the results shown in <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f015" ref-type="fig">Figure 15</xref> and <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f016" ref-type="fig">Figure 16</xref> show less homogeneity in latency, with more spikes. Latency readings typically range from 8 to 9 s, indicating that higher variability could result from increased attenuation caused by a greater number of obstacles or longer distances to the transmission point.</p><p><xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f017" ref-type="fig">Figure 17</xref> depicts the standard deviation of latency for the four different locations of the receiving node, showing how latency differs in terms of consistency between environments.

If such a spike is ignored, it can be concluded that the latency stability is slightly better for locations 1 (living room) and 3 (entrance), whereas oscillations are greater for locations 2 (kitchen) and 4 (bedroom). These locations show higher variability, likely caused by increased signal attenuation, the presence of more obstacles, or less favorable propagation conditions in those areas.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5dot3-sensors-25-01190"><title>5.3. Experiments in an Industrial Scenario</title><p>The second set of tests was carried out in a static indoor environment, as shown in <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f018" ref-type="fig">Figure 18</xref>, which represents the interior of a shipyard workshop, where there were many more obstacles than in the first experiment, including multiple pallets stacked with pipes on top, industrial machinery, gantry cranes, workers, etc. The distance between the transmitting node and the receiving node was 43 m for the first scenario and then 117 m for the second. <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f018" ref-type="fig">Figure 18</xref> depicts the deployment of two nodes (in red) and a single sender (in green) that sent data packets to each node. <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f019" ref-type="fig">Figure 19</xref> shows an image taken during the tests of the real position of the sender in the workshop, whereas <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f020" ref-type="fig">Figure 20</xref> shows the receiving node during one of the tests.</p><sec id="sec5dot3dot1-sensors-25-01190"><title>5.3.1. Communications Latency</title><p><xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f021" ref-type="fig">Figure 21</xref> and <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f022" ref-type="fig">Figure 22</xref> show the communication latency of messages sent using the developed protocol at 9 s intervals from the two scenarios selected for the shipyard workshop. <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f021" ref-type="fig">Figure 21</xref> shows that latency remained more stable for the first scenario (i.e., with nodes at a distance of 43 m). In fact, latency variability is small, losing only one packet. The typical delay oscillates between 8 and 9 s. <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f022" ref-type="fig">Figure 22</xref> shows more variation than the second scenario (i.e., for a distance between nodes of 117 m) suffered more latency oscillation and spikes. In such a second scenario, latency usually ranged between 8 and 9 s, with peaks of up to 11 s and a total of five packets lost, which are related to the increase in the communications distance and to the existence of more obstacles in the signal propagation path inside the workshop. As with the home automation tests, a peak occurs (in this case, around packet 50). As it was previously mentioned, such a spike is due to the fact that, after a certain number of minutes, the protocol checks whether the communication is still active, causing a delay in the remaining packets.</p></sec><sec id="sec5dot3dot2-sensors-25-01190"><title>5.3.2. Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR)</title><p>In order to evaluate the reliability and adaptability of the protocol to different environments, the packets sent and received during 100 packet transmissions between two nodes (without including potential retransmissions) are compared in <xref rid="sensors-25-01190-f023" ref-type="fig">Figure 23</xref>. For the indoor environment, the protocol achieved a 100% PDR in the first three positions (i.e., all packets were delivered successfully) and 99% in the fourth one, thus demonstrating a solid performance in stable short-range scenarios. For the industrial environment, the obtained results were decisive in clarifying whether the protocol is actually valid for large industrial scenarios. The result obtained for the first position at 40 m was similar to the one for the fourth indoor spot, with a 99% PDR. However, for the second tested spot, where the distance exceeded 100 m, PDR decreased to 95%, which is expected, since being in a Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) industrial area, the longer the distance, the higher the signal propagation loss, and the larger the number of obstacles that can be found on the communications path between the emitter and the transceiver. In any case, despite this 5% loss in the PDR (which, for instance, could be reduced by adding more retransmissions to the protocol), it can be concluded that the proposed system can be used in industrial environments similar to the ones tested (i.e., with long distances and with the presence of multiple large metallic obstacles).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec6-sensors-25-01190"><title>6. Key Findings</title><p>After developing the proposed system and evaluating its basic performance, the following key findings can be provided:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Opportunistic communications are an emerging field that has gained relevance for scenarios with restricted connectivity. Most of the previous research cited in this article focused on more theoretical approaches such as routing optimization or protocol efficiency for different network topologies, but there are not many practical evaluations. This article compensates for this lack by presenting a new multi-layer approach that combines Bluetooth Mesh for discovery and libp2p for communications, which improves adaptability and robustness in multiple environments.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Use of other communications technologies. The protocol proposed in this article was designed to be agnostic to the physical layer and adaptable to multiple communication technologies, thus facilitating integration with emerging networks such as 6G or already well-established technologies like 5G, Zigbee, Wi-Fi, or LoRa, which were considered as potential alternatives during the design phase and can be used in future developments to create comparisons with the results obtained in this article for Bluetooth 5.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Use of other application-level technologies. The devised protocol can incorporate at the application level technologies like blockchain, which can improve data integrity and decentralized management through the use of smart contracts or the storage of transaction records on the blockchain for audits and traceability [<xref rid="B45-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>The results obtained during the experiments demonstrated that the protocol is robust against metallic obstacles and signal attenuation at over 100 m and maintains low latency in all scenarios, validating its suitability for industrial environments.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Although the protocol was verified in domestic and industrial environments, it can be applied to dynamic scenarios such as vehicular networks (e.g., real-time traffic updates), natural disaster situations (e.g., drone swarms with intermittent connectivity), or smart cities (such as mobile sensor networks).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Scalability. The performed experiments demonstrated the viability of using the system on the selected home and industrial scenarios, showing its basic functionality with a reduced minimal P2P environment with only two nodes. Such evaluations were carried out for this article to control all the variables of the experiments and thus accurately show the basic performance of the protocol, such as delivery latency and success rate, without interference from other factors. However, in real-world scenarios, Pub/Sub protocols are designed to operate in distributed networks with hundreds or thousands of nodes, so further research is still necessary in terms of scalability. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that some authors performed similar experiments with different protocols and technologies. For instance, in [<xref rid="B46-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], the authors performed several experiments with 1000 nodes, a maximum mesh size of 12, and a round-trip time of 100 ms, achieving a 100% PDR when a Sybil attack [<xref rid="B47-sensors-25-01190" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] took place. Thus, the authors, by combining low latency, high resistance to attacks, and self-recovery mechanisms, were able to validate that their protocol was suitable for large-scale networks.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec7-sensors-25-01190"><title>7. Conclusions</title><p>This article described a novel communication protocol that combines multiple technologies to enable decentralized and opportunistic communications among IoT devices, testing the performance and reliability of the proposed protocol by conducting tests that focused on latency and packet loss in various indoor and outdoor environments.</p><p>The results showed that the protocol works effectively in environments with minimal signal obstruction, maintaining constant latency and a reduced jitter, as in the home experiments. However, in other locations like industrial environments, with more barriers between the transmitting and receiving nodes, the performance was less stable, with higher latency variability and occasional spikes and packet drops. These findings imply that physical barriers and obstacles, such as large metallic objects, walls, and furniture, have a significant impact on the performance of the opportunistic protocol, particularly on signal strength and reliability.</p><p>Consequently, this paper demonstrated that the proposed protocol is a viable solution for implementing opportunistic systems based on Bluetooth 5 and libp2p in both industrial and home automation environments. The results highlight that the protocol achieves low latency, with minimum values around 8 s (depending on the environment). In addition, it can be stated that the protocol performs well in terms of reliability, with packet reception rates between 95% and 99% in the evaluated scenarios. These findings suggest that the protocol can be effectively deployed in diverse scenarios, although its performance can vary depending on environmental factors. Thus, although this article provides clear guidelines on how to make use of the developed OEC communications protocol (which is available as an open-source project), future researchers may need to optimize its operation by adapting it to the specific conditions of each application, including adjustments to the network topology or the incorporation of fault-tolerance mechanisms.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank the Navantia personnel who collaborated with us both during the tests carried out in the shipyard workshops.
