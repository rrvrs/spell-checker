Furthermore, youths (5&#x02013;24 years old) with disabilities (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, specific learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, etc.) seem even less physically active than those without disabilities [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Indeed, approximately 80% of children with disabilities do not respect the minimum of 60 minutes of PA per day of moderate to vigorous intensity [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Because physical inactivity is often linked to several chronic conditions later in life including obesity, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, colon and breast cancer, diabetes (type 2) and osteoporosis [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], promoting the PA participation of young people is essential.</p><p>PA is crucial to the social, affective, physical and cognitive development of children, adolescents and young adults with disabilities. Daily PA is characterized by improvements in several areas: social (relationships, communication), physical (motor skills, cardiometabolic health), cognitive (executive functions, attention) and affective (well-being, self-esteem) [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. More specifically, it relates to greater endurance, strength, coordination, balance, weight loss, enhanced self-esteem, improved impulsivity management, anger and aggressivity control, concentration, mental flexibility, problem-solving skills and working memory [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additional positive outcomes include a reduced risk of developing chronic diseases, stress reduction, increased energy levels, and enhanced social activity including peer interactions resulting in friendships [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It appears, then, that PA yields multiple benefits in several spheres of development for youths with disabilities.</p><p>Organized youth sports during childhood and adolescence may be a promising avenue for PA promotion as they are positively related to the frequency of leisure-time PA in adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, one of the most common barriers to PA participation cited by parents is the lack of suitable programs for children with disabilities [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Indeed, programs and opportunities for PA participants are acknowledged to be limited compared to those with no disabilities [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The reason may be the many challenges of developing community-based programs for youths with disabilities, which include the lack of adaptive exercise equipment, the use of appropriate fitness assessments, transportation issues and the recruitment of qualified personnel [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, youths with disabilities practice less PA because it is not adapted to their needs for various reasons (multiple disorders, complexity, minority status), which explains the scarcity of PA programs available for them [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Other concerns regarding those programs include access restrictions, lack of information about physical activities, lack of community support and the diversity of disabilities, which makes participation more difficult [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The lack of effective community and group-based programs for youths with disabilities limits opportunities for developmental improvement in the aforementioned areas [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Indeed, physical inactivity can affect basic body management skills such as stability and spatial awareness, making PA participation more difficult over time [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, a lack of fundamental movement skills can lead to multiple issues such as insecurity and low self-esteem at an early age as children observe the difference between themselves and other children at school [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This early gap predisposes youths with disabilities to problems later in life including obesity, metabolic disorders, decrease in overall health condition, increase in sedentary behaviour and social isolation, all of which contribute to a lower quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>As a result, individualized PA is often seen as an answer to these problems, since youths with disabilities are more likely to participate in solitary, sedentary and home-based leisure activities than in active PA or group-based and community leisure programs [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. One advantage of individualized PA is the possibility of responding to an individual&#x02019;s specific needs. A corresponding problem, however, is that individualized PA limits social opportunities and often includes therapy-based situations that require qualified individuals and resources. Indeed, although individual PA have some benefits for youths with disabilities, access to quality group-based programs represents an important aspect of their social development.</p><p>A previous study [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], for example, shows that PA programs help improve social communication skills in parallel with traditional interventions such as therapy or treatment and may reduce the severity of restricted and repetitive behaviours for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Group-based PA is undoubtedly a rich social experience, as it creates a feeling of acceptance by peers and helps create opportunities for friendship [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, children and adolescents who participate in such programs often report they are motivated by their peers and have better social interactions [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Group activities also facilitate social and communication skills because team sports players support each other [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In general, participation in a group-based activity program can significantly help improve interpersonal and social skills [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. All these benefits are important for young people with disabilities, as the social component is often clinically difficult to address, and group-based PA programs offer a way to correct this limitation. The social complexities faced by youths with disabilities underscore the clinical significance of the social component. Group-based PA programs stand as innovative solutions to address these issues, providing a nuanced approach to empower individuals with disabilities to navigate social interactions [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the context of a systematic review, these insights establish the foundation for further exploration of the effects and implications of group-based PA programs for individuals with disabilities.</p><p>Although certain studies and reviews show that group-based PA is effective in interventions conducted with children, adolescents and young adults with disabilities, results regarding the effects remain unclear owing to the broad disparities in sample size, heterogeneity of interventions, intervention time, intervention frequency and measurement [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While there is evidence that PA programs provide some health benefits, little is known about specific group-based effects, strategies for effectiveness, sustainability, program development, adaptation details and the programs&#x02019; empirical value for youths with disabilities. The present systematic review, therefore, aims to identify the characteristics and effects of group-based PA programs for young people (5&#x02013;24 years old) with disabilities.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Method</title><p>This review is based on studies conducted over the last 12 years (2013&#x02013;2025). The initial time frame focused on the last 10 years (2013&#x02013;2023) to prioritize recent research on group-based PA programs for school-age children, adolescents, and young adults with disabilities. However, due to the extended completion period of the review, multiple updates were made to include newly published studies, which led to an expanded publication window. It is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42023392682) and adheres to the guidelines in the PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is important to note that this systematic review did not require ethical approval, as it involved the synthesis and analysis of existing published data and did not involve direct interaction with human subjects or the collection of new primary data. See <xref rid="pone.0323707.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Checklist</xref> for PRISMA guidelines.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Eligibility was based on compliance with the criteria described below. A summary of these criteria is provided in <xref rid="pone.0323707.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Participants</title><p>This review targeted studies including participants five to 24 years old living with a disability of any kind (developmental, learning, emotional, physical, intellectual or sensory). The American Psychological Association (APA) defines disability as: &#x0201c;a lasting physical or mental impairment that significantly interferes with an individual&#x02019;s ability to function in one or more central life activities, such as self-care, ambulation, communication, social interaction, sexual expression, or employment&#x0201d;[<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Examples include autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, visual impairment/blindness, hearing impairment and mobility limitations. These criteria were selected to ensure heterogeneity within the population and the number of possible outcomes resulting from the PA programs regarding different disabilities. The age range was selected to encompass three distinct period of life at which PA plays a crucial role in development: childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, thereby providing a broader perspective on the effects of PA programs.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Intervention</title><p>The studies in this review examine the effects of participation in group-based PA or sports programs for youths with disabilities. Programs are defined as structured and organized sessions supervised by a paid or volunteer coach, adult, or specialist in any setting (outside, indoor, park, pool) and adapted for youth with disabilities to offer them an opportunity to have fun and practice PA in a safe and secure environment for a certain amount of time (i.e., 2 weeks or more). Thus, competitive, school-based, or performance-oriented interventions (i.e., those designed to meet institutional standards, benchmarks, or performance goals&#x02014;such as academic grading systems, elite sports rankings, or skill certification programs) and therapy-based interventions (intended to relieve or heal a disorder) were excluded. These interventions typically require structured, individualized, or highly specialized approaches, which do not align with our focus on community-based programs designed for broader accessibility and inclusivity. The exclusion criterion was based on the need to examine interventions that can be implemented in non-specialized, everyday community settings without requiring professional oversight or predefined performance metrics. As well, this review focuses on programs and interventions that can be carried out by PA specialists or educators within the community since they are more accessible and can benefit more than one participant at a time.</p><p>Additionally, studies were not accepted if the intervention was conducted on a one-to-one basis or if the participant was paired with an instructor, parent or specialist, as the aim was to examine the effects of participation in a group-based environment (i.e., with other participants to promote social interactions). Indeed, while adult support can facilitate PA sessions, it can also hinder opportunities for autonomy and friendships, particularly in the case of youths with disabilities [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>For the purposes of this review, therefore, group-based activity required at least three individuals sharing similar characteristics (e.g., age), given that a group is usually defined as &#x0201c;two or more people who interact with and exert mutual influence on each other&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, this review focuses on groups of three or more individuals to avoid pair sports that limit interaction during play (e.g., tennis, badminton). Accordingly, all individually-performed interventions or programs (e.g., swimming, surfing, training exercises, fitness, treadmills, walking) were excluded unless performed in a group setting involving exchange, play, games or any kind of social contact including recurring communication with other participants. Home-based interventions (home exercise programs, online exercises, device-served interventions (e.g., Wii console) were also excluded. The only programs selected were those requiring the participants&#x02019; physical presence.</p><p>Mixed intervention sessions involving an individual PA (other than warm-ups and cool-downs) first and in a group setting later (not necessarily in this order) were likewise excluded. Other unrelated, multi-component interventions (e.g., diet plans, meetings) (e.g., health programs) were also excluded, as the primary focus was the benefits of PA programs themselves and not the related components. Finally, programs that involved pairing participants without disabilities together with those with disabilities were included, however only the effects towards participants with disabilities were examined.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The outcomes of this systematic review offer information regarding the effects of adapted PA programs on youth with disabilities. More specifically, it focusses on identifying variables that reflect the effects of group-based adapted PA program across four key domains: cognitive (e.g., attention, memory), affective (e.g., self-esteem, emotional well-being), physical (e.g., strength, endurance), and social (e.g., social interaction, communication). As well, they provide insights on PA programs characteristics including length, frequency, intensity, PA, trainers, adaptation details, group settings, implementation, limitations and recommendations for program development.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Study design</title><p>The current review included quasi-experimental design and randomized controlled trials. Non-empirical studies, theses, meta-analyses, grey literature and reviews of any type were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Search strategy</title><p>Articles related to group-based PA programs for youths (5&#x02013;24 years old) were collected from the following databases: APA PsycINFO (498), Medline (1396), SPORTDiscus (541), and &#x000c9;rudit (280). Each database was searched using the same keywords (translated into French for &#x000c9;rudit, as it is a French-language database), with the search strategy consistently applied across all platforms as we used subject headings (SU) to ensure comprehensive coverage, including MeSH, Thesaurus, and other controlled vocabulary terms specific to each database (see <xref rid="pone.0323707.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0323707.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 List</xref>). All query terms were individually verified for compatibility, confirming that the search equation was uniformly effective for the following categories generated with the assistance of a specialized librarian: 1) Program, 2) Physical activity, 3) Disabilities, 4) Youth (5&#x02013;24 years old).

The RoB 2 tool is a revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool specifically designed to evaluate the risk of bias in randomized trials.

The ROBINS-I tool, on the other hand, is designed to assess the risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions and includes domains such as confounding variables, selection of participants, classification of interventions, deviations from intended interventions, missing data, measurement of outcomes and selection of reported results [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the studies included using the criteria for the study design. Disagreements over risk of bias assessments or the rationales behind these assessments were resolved through deliberation and dialogue. Next, an overall summary risk of bias (ROBINS-I: low, moderate, serious, critical; RoB 2: low, some concerns, high risk) was generated for each outcome, where the study&#x02019;s overall bias level was determined based on the highest level of bias identified among the different domains.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Data extraction and analysis</title><p>For all selected studies or articles, information was retrieved using a grid that included the following variables: country, participants, study design, programs&#x02019; components, study outcomes, study limitations and recommendations.

Similarly, Angeli et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and Hsu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] highlight participants&#x02019; autonomy by selecting specific training adaptable to individual needs, thus depicting a participant-centered approach. Stojanovi&#x00107; et al. and Ekins et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], for their part, focus on participants&#x02019; emotional states. Consistent with this emotional aspect, Phung et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] propose strategies for emotional regulation with reminders to use breathing techniques. Alternatively, Angeli et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and Hsu et al.

[<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] provide detailed instructions through audio cassettes. Ryuh et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] argue for disability awareness education through neurotypical pairing for cooperative environments and prejudice reduction.

In addition, the presence of confounding variables (e.g., previous experience in PA, initial skills levels, severity of disabilities, additional treatments outside the intervention, motivation, and mood change) can influence the quality of the study and the validity of results.</p><p>This being said, almost all studies were considered to have some concerns or a serious risk of bias following use of the risk of bias tools (RoB 2 and ROBINS-I; see <xref rid="pone.0323707.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>). Additionally, certain variables were not assessed or could have been assessed with better tools as reported in multiple studies. The authors of only one study [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], in fact, discuss their program&#x02019;s fidelity of implementation, which ranged from 73 to 100%. Another issue is that parents were often asked to complete questionnaires because the child could not complete the surveys. Thus, the authors were unsure as to whether the parents&#x02019; perceptions were the same as those of their child regarding the latter&#x02019;s progress while participating in the programs and hence questioned the value of the results. Finally, while most of the studies employ a quasi-experimental design (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16), only 11 include control or comparison groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec029"><title>Discussion</title><p>This systematic review aimed to identify the characteristics and outcomes of group-based PA programs for young people (5&#x02013;24 years old) with disabilities. A total of 20 studies proposed programs with group-based physical activities corresponding to the selection criteria. The results from the studies selected indicate that young people with disabilities could see improvements in various aspects such as physical, social, affective, and cognitive ones. Moreover, this review clarified the characteristics of group-based PA programs by identifying strategies for effectiveness, which represents an improvement over previous researches (see <xref rid="pone.0323707.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref> for a summary of all extracted data). Still, some methodological issues remain and recommendations regarding these challenges will be offered to guide future research.</p><sec id="sec030"><title>Program characteristics</title><p>The components and characteristics of the programs vary significantly, but all propose interesting ways to better understand the strengths and limitations of group-based PA programs.</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Program structure</title><p>Most of the time, the frequency, intensity, and length of the programs were, respectively, twice a week, 30&#x02013;60 minutes, and for a 12-week period. As a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] shows, children with certain disabilities can participate in group-based programs that include weekly sessions of 30&#x02013;60 minutes. Accordingly, it may be advisable to respect these parameters, as anything more demanding may be highly energy consuming and require significant resources and adaptation time. The current review, moreover, reveals that at least 30 minutes of PA per week in a PA program can yield benefits for youths with disabilities. According to the literature [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], people living with disabilities can derive health benefits from an average of 20 minutes per day of PA. These findings highlight the importance of encouraging consistent participation in PA, even in smaller amounts, as it can contribute significantly to the overall health of youths with disabilities. Otherwise, the intensity, frequency, and duration of activities in the selected studies did not necessarily align with the significance of the outcomes. This shows there is no clear evidence that greater intensity, greater frequency, or longer practice sessions result in more meaningful outcomes.</p><p>These findings are in line with those of a previous systematic review examining the effectiveness of group-based organized participation in PA for children with ASD [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The Howells review suggests that determining the optimal dosage for such programs require more attention as even shorter programs had shown benefits. Otherwise, the findings of the research conducted by Haegele et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] propose that the demeanor of the trainer and PA environment, including peers and settings, exert significant influence as facilitators for PA involvement. These later results suggest that the surrounding environment and individuals involved in PA are more significant than the specific program parameters in achieving favorable outcomes for youth with disabilities.</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>Content and features of physical activity</title><p>The most popular programs proposed were soccer and martial arts. Indeed, these two PAs require little equipment and can be practiced conveniently in multiple settings, which makes them easier to implement. Nevertheless, they call for some form of training or at least PA-related experience. As observed in the studies examined here, all trainers in the programs were qualified in their domain-specific PA. Qualification appears to be an important factor for leading a program of this kind, which may explain why very few interventions in this review require additional training for trainers. One aspect the selected studies fail to mention is the significance of the trainers&#x02019; connection to the participants and how this impacts the program&#x02019;s effectiveness. The literature on this subject suggests that diversified trainers and the presence of specific characteristics (e.g., a positive attitude) may enhance the PA experience [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>As regards group settings, pairing neurotypical participants with neurodivergent participants seems to be a good alternative for facilitating progress and evolution through PA programs, and other studies demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Participants are often divided into subgroups of six to eight, however little information is given as to why and how these subgroups are created. Smaller groups are no doubt easier to manage, but further evidence is needed regarding use of this procedure with youths with disabilities in group-based PA programs. Additionally, other reviews report that there is no information on group composition and the reasons programs are implemented [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Another important point is that very few studies discuss youths with combined disabilities or with different disabilities in the same groups. As reported in other studies, it may be more difficult to incorporate heterogeneous groups as this involves more staff, more needs to fill and generally more preparation [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, implementing such groups could promote inclusivity, be less experiment-driven and propose new avenues for PA programs in community settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec033"><title>Strategies for effectiveness</title><p>Although previous researches highlight the lack of information on adaptation details or program process [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], multiple specifications have emerged in recent years regarding programs&#x02019; strategies and adaptations. Indeed, several programs include adaptation time (gradual contact with environment and intervention), which can help participants to become familiar with settings and equipment [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Trainers can therefore react, rearrange and adapt the environment based on participants&#x02019; special needs. By identifying individual needs, the program manager can consider the emotional state, current mood and interests of the participants [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], so that the proposed intervention better matches the participants&#x02019; abilities. Moreover, the support of trainers and the implementation of a ratio per participant are used to prevent complications [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>The results of this review also highlight a lack of information for addressing crisis situations. Indeed, only one study addressed solutions to frustration or overwhelming crisis other than parents&#x02019; involvement [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thus, a specific protocol should be developed on how to handle participants&#x02019; frustration behaviours or overwhelming emotions during sessions. For example, because individuals with ASD are very sensitive to their surroundings [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], the ability to properly address, react and respond to this sensitivity limits the potential harm to both the participants and their peers. An alternative is to adapt the environment to youths with disabilities to make it safe, adequate and well spaced [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. One article describes a pilot study conducted to validate their intervention [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Others used a progression sequence as the session advanced [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For example, time was added throughout the sessions as the participants became accustomed to the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec034"><title>Methodological concerns</title><p>An important limitation of group-based activity programs is confounding variables. Indeed, when studying youths with disabilities, several variables liable to impact the validity of the results must be controlled. The main confounding variables identified in this review include previous PA experience, initial skills level, severity of disabilities, additional treatment outside the intervention, motivation, and mood change. The risk of bias within all studies is therefore relatively high. The reason may be that in most cases, the assessor or participants were aware of the conditions of the experiment. Also, the fact that parents are frequently asked to complete questionnaires or take part in data collection often reduces the validity of the results. Finally, there is a need for programs to conduct fidelity of implementation measures before evaluating their outcomes. As reported in this review, only one study discussed fidelity of implementation [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Hence, empirical value should be promoted through the assessment of fidelity as it could subsequently facilitate measurements and data collection. As well, the assessment of fidelity for group-based PA programs would provide a main framework that could benefit other organizations and be employed in multiple communities.</p></sec><sec id="sec035"><title>Outcomes</title><p>This section discusses the implications of the outcomes retrieved from the programs, highlighting their significance and potential impact on future developments.</p></sec><sec id="sec036"><title>Physical outcomes</title><p>Over half the studies in this review examine physical outcomes (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11). Results indicate that group-based PA programs for youths five to 24 years old can improve general physical fitness, specific motor skills, aerobics, strength, coordination, balance and endurance. Indeed, according to a review of reviews [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], most other studies on PA programs report physical outcomes as the main results. Similarly, results from the current review indicate that PA programs benefit the physical development of youths with diverse disabilities. While this review does not cover all disabilities, the results show multiple benefits for some specific types including a few, like Fragile X syndrome, which are less common.</p></sec><sec id="sec037"><title>Social and affective outcomes</title><p>The studies in this review reveal the positive effects of group-based PA programs on young people&#x02019;s social and affective development. The main social outcome for youths with disabilities is improved emotional responses in areas such as self-control and emotional regulation. Additionally, results suggest that group-based PA programs help reduce anxiety and symptoms of depression [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], which is consistent with findings elsewhere in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Nonetheless, the mechanisms behind these social and affective improvements, however, are not fully described. Most of the studies reviewed lack detailed information on the underlying processes of social skills development, making it difficult to discern specific meanings within a given context due to numerous confounding variables. Still, the studies included in this review show that being part of a community or a group facilitates communication opportunities and offers youths with disabilities a plausible option for developing social skills [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>These findings are in line with previous studies that promote the importance of organized, group-based PA participation for the social development of young people with disabilities [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. However, it should be noted that most studies on social outcomes in this review discuss youths with ASD and ID. Nevertheless, the results are highly promising, given that multiple studies of youths with different disabilities (e.g., DS) show that social capabilities are enhanced through PA programs.</p></sec><sec id="sec038"><title>Cognitive outcomes</title><p>Regarding cognitive outcomes, this review&#x02019;s main finding is that group-based PA programs can improve reaction time, inhibition and attention [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], indicating that PA can be beneficial in other settings such as schools. Interestingly, another review suggests similar results [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Yet, cognitive outcomes remain the less studied domain for group-based PA programs among youth with disabilities as it is often the case in PA research [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Assessing cognitive achievements regarding young individuals with disabilities presents a considerable problem for researchers for two reasons. First, the broad range of disabilities includes diverse cognitive capacities and constraints, making the use of standardized evaluation instruments challenging [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Next, the intervention aside, cognitive development is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, environmental and individual factors. In short, the variety of disabilities together with the limitations of conventional assessment tools add to the difficulty of measuring cognitive outcomes for youths with disabilities in research studies [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec039"><title>Recommendations for future studies</title><p>Future studies should focus on understanding the possible differences between high-incidence disabilities (e.g., ASD and ID) and low-incidence disabilities (e.g., Fragile X syndrome). Additionally, samples should include more female participants. Because cognitive outcomes are least discussed in terms of interventions, further research is needed in this area, given that cognitive skills can often be transferred to other areas of life. Moreover, further investigations are necessary to identify the specific mechanisms behind outcomes (e.g., key moments, specific cerebral zone activity, specific behaviour patterns, etc.). Other recommendations include employing additional adapted measures, considering past sport experiences, increasing sample size, and ensuring that programs are feasible and realistic (e.g., costs are kept low). It was also suggested to consider participants&#x02019; interests and ensure a safe, suitably equipped environment that promotes a balance between fun and development [<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323707.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. More programs need to identify clear protocol and crisis management strategies for youths with disabilities, and the number of confounding variables should be addressed to limit bias. Similarly, the impacts of trainers should be considered while measuring fidelity of implementation and desired outcomes. The long-term effects of these programs thus require further study, as evidence of sustainability is missing for most interventions.</p><p>More information is also required to better understand group dynamics, including composition. As well, further studies need to examine the possibilities for group-based practice to include heterogeneous participants, which could promote inclusivity and facilitate the implementation of community programs. More action is also necessary to ensure greater accessibility to PA programs for youths with disabilities. Overall, the studies included in this review suggest that group-based PA programs have significant potential when it comes to these individuals and should be implemented in parallel with special schools or treatment. The recommendations derived from these selected studies can therefore guide future research and program development.</p></sec><sec id="sec040"><title>Limitations</title><p>This review adhered to several criteria and used a large initial sample size. A major effort was made to document the procedures employed (PROSPERO; CRD42023392682) clearly and comprehensively. However, the eligibility criteria (e.g., exclusion of therapy-based, school-based, home-based and group-based programs) were very specific, and at times the lack of details in certain studies made classification difficult. A result is that some interesting studies may have been left out. However, in cases of uncertainty, the studies were carefully examined and analyzed before being excluded, and reasons for the decision were provided. One limitation of this review is the exclusion of qualitative studies. The reason, however, is that our primary focus was on experimental and quasi-experimental designs presenting quantitative data offering crucial insights into the studies&#x02019; empirical validity. A second limitation is that some disabilities were not represented in the 20 selected articles.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec041"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, this systematic review aimed to clarify the characteristics and outcomes of group-based PA programs for individuals with disabilities aged five to 24 years.
