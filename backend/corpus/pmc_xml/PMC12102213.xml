With no specific antiviral treatment available, vaccination remains the most effective protective strategy for TBE. Unlike currently available inactivated TBE vaccines that require repeated boosters, live-attenuated vaccines could offer lifelong immunity with a single dose. Langat virus (LGTV) is a naturally attenuated strain of TBE virus (TBEV). In this study, we engineered and rescued four infectious clones (ICs) of LGTV using RNA- and DNA-based reverse genetics methods. The ICs rescued by DNA-based method showed higher genetic stability in cell culture. One of the ICs rescued by DNA-based method was further evaluated in vitro and in vivo, which exhibited growth kinetics and immune profile comparable to the LGTV strain in our laboratory. This reverse genetics platform will be utilized to introduce targeted mutations within the LGTV genome to develop a live-attenuated TBE vaccine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Live attenuated vaccines</kwd><kwd>Virology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004722</institution-id><institution>Stiftelsen Lars Hiertas Minne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FO2023-0253</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003170</institution-id><institution>Stiftelsen f&#x000f6;r Kunskaps- och Kompetensutveckling</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20200063</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), caused by TBE virus (TBEV), is one of the most important tick-borne diseases in Europe and Asia, with clinical manifestations ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to severe neurological disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Over the last decades, the incidence of TBE has increased dramatically in several European countries, including Sweden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Despite its increasing prevalence, there is currently no antiviral treatment available for TBE, making vaccination the most effective protective measure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The commercially available TBE vaccines are based on inactivated TBEV particles. Despite being effective, these inactivated vaccines require regular booster doses to sustain immunity and occasional vaccine breakthrough cases have been reported, mainly in the elderly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In contrast, live-attenuated orthoflavivirus vaccines have the potential to provide lifelong immunity after a single dose because they mimic natural viral infection, stimulating both innate and adaptive immunity, thus triggering a robust immune response through neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Langat virus (LGTV) is a naturally attenuated strain of TBEV and a potential candidate for a live-attenuated TBE vaccine. An attenuated variant of LGTV, strain TP21 was previously evaluated in human clinical trials in the 1970s in Russia. Despite its high potential, the trial was discontinued after appearance of significant adverse neurological symptoms in 35 out of 649,470 vaccinees, as reviewed by Gritsun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Efforts have previously been made to develop a live-attenuated TBE vaccine using LGTV or various TBEV strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Several attempts were made to further attenuate the LGTV strain TP21 by serial passaging in chicken embryo cells, use of mutagen, or production of chimeric LGTVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Orthoflaviviruses like TBEV and LGTV contain a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome that translates into a single polyprotein. This polyprotein is further processed into three structural proteins and seven non-structural (NS) proteins. The NS proteins are essential for the orthoflavivirus replication cycle to produce additional copies of the viral genome. The newly synthesized genome is then encapsidated by the structural proteins to form virions. In this study, we harnessed the natural cellular events to initiate the orthoflavivirus replication cycle leading to the production of LGTV infectious clones (ICs). We applied RNA- and DNA-based reverse genetics methods to design and rescue four ICs of LGTV. The RNA-based method utilized in vitro transcribed LGTV genomic RNA as described by Lindqvist et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, whereas the DNA-based method utilized overlapping subgenomic amplicons as described by Aubry et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The discontinued use of live LGTV in earlier clinical trials (Gritsun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>), underscores the importance of further attenuation of the virus to enhance safety while maintaining immunogenicity. This provides the rationale for developing a reverse genetics LGTV platform to systematically introduce targeted mutations. The long-term goal of this study is to exploit the potential of reverse genetics to further attenuate LGTV and develop a live-attenuated TBE vaccine. Over the last few decades, reverse genetics has transformed studies of important aspects of virus biology and the development of live-attenuated vaccines through genetic manipulations. The technique has led to the development of vital vaccines, including the novel oral poliovirus vaccine and the influenza vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, two orthoflavivirus vaccines developed by reverse genetics are approved for human use, and several promising candidates are currently in preclinical and clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Despite its immense potential, reverse genetics has yet to be augmented to produce a live-attenuated TBE vaccine, since all commercially available TBE vaccines are based on inactivated TBEV particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In this study, we passaged the rescued LGTV ICs in cell culture and assessed their genetic integrity and stability by next generation sequencing (NGS). In addition, we performed in vitro and in vivo characterization of one of the rescued LGTV ICs and compared it with the LGTV strain in our laboratory. This study provides a crucial foundation for developing a more robust TBE vaccine capable of providing long-lasting immunity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Genetic difference between our laboratory LGTV and the virus reference at GenBank</title><p id="Par7">Orthoflaviviruses are known to undergo genetic adaptation during passaging in mammalian cells.

The SNVs were distributed over the whole LGTV genome. In general, the SNVs fractions were higher in ICs at p5 as compared to p0 which could be due to the preferential selection of those SNVs during cultivation in Vero E6 cells. Passaging the LGTV ICs in cell culture showed amplification of some SNVs already present at p0 as well as emergence of new SNVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Most reverse genetics systems require construction of infectious cDNA plasmids that encode manipulated viral genomes. We attempted to rescue LGTV ICs by constructing an infectious cDNA plasmid, but we were unable to produce a stable plasmid for amplification in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (data not shown). Plasmids containing orthoflavivirus cDNAs have previously been shown to be highly unstable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, the presence of cryptic prokaryotic promoter sequences within the orthoflavivirus genome may generate peptides that are toxic to <italic>E. coli</italic>, which could further complicate the process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. To overcome these problems, we used reverse genetics approaches described by Aubry et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and Lindqvist et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">In this study, we utilized RNA- and DNA-based reverse genetic strategies to rescue four infectious clones of LGTV. The RNA-based method utilised full length LGTV RNA transcripts that were synthesized and capped in vitro before cellular transfection. The transfected RNA transcripts harnessed the cellular translational machinery to initiate orthoflavivirus replication cycle to produce LGTV<sub>RNA+L&#x02013;Max</sub> and LGTV<sub>RNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> virions. We have previously used Lipofectamine 2000 for rescue of TBEV ICs by RNA-based reverse genetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In this study, we used Lipofectamine MessengerMAX in parallel to Lipofectamine 2000 for RNA transfection, because the former is claimed to provide two-fold higher transfection efficiency as compared to Lipofectamine 2000. The DNA-based method required transfection of four overlapping DNA fragments to exploit the homologous recombination within mammalian cells. There was an overlap of 205&#x02009;bp between amplicon 1 and 2, an overlap of 84&#x02009;bp between amplicon 2 and 3, and an overlap of 101&#x02009;bp between amplicon 3 and 4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), which facilitated homologous DNA recombination to generate full length DNA fragments comprising human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, complete LGTV genome, the hepatitis delta ribozyme (HDVr) and the simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal (SV40 pA). The CMV promoter facilitated transcription of LGTV RNA by cellular DNA dependent RNA polymerase, whereas SV40 pA and HDVr facilitated transport of LGTV RNA transcripts from nucleus into cytoplasm and post-transcriptional processing to initiate the virus replication cycle to produce LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> and LGTV<sub>DNA+Amaxa</sub> virions. A co-culture of HEK-293 and Vero E6 cells was used to rescue LGTV ICs where the former facilitates transfection, and the latter is more compatible for virus propagation. Moreover, we applied the Nucleofector program Q-001 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) to transfect the co-culture of Vero E6 and HEK-293 cells. This program is optimized for HEK-293 cells and not for Vero cells. We used Q-001 to benefit from the transfection potential of HEK-293.</p><p id="Par16">TBEV exists as a pool of variants called quasispecies which undergo adaptation in response to selection pressure during propagation in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. NGS analysis of the rescued viruses confirmed the presence of quasispecies within LGTV ICs. It has been shown that viable TBEV variants can exist at abundances of less than 1% in the long-term and can become a major part of the viral population under favorable conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In this study, several SNVs with an abundance of &#x0223c;1% were identified in the E protein of all LGTV ICs from p0 and p5 (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The orthoflavivirus E protein is required for cellular infection through receptor mediated endocytosis and the diversity observed in the E protein of LGTV quasispecies may facilitate LGTV ICs to infect a broader range of cells. Passaging LGTV ICs in cell culture led to both the selection of existing variants and the emergence of new variants. Sanger sequencing of LGTV<sub>Lab</sub> revealed ten SNVs compared to the original TP21 sequence in GenBank. Interestingly, two of these ten SNVs, H718Y and D3202N, were also detected in all the rescued LGTV ICs and their levels increased during subsequent propagation in Vero cells. These observations suggest that H718Y and D3202N are clearly an in vitro phenomenon, occurring primarily in cell culture. Interestingly, the rescued viruses from p0 showed comparatively higher number of SNVs as compared to those from p5, suggesting that the viruses experienced strong selection pressure during initial culturing. Conversely, the rescued viruses from p5 showed a higher sum of SNV fractions as compared to p0, reflecting virus adaptation over time while cultivating in mammalian cells. Similar observations of selecting existing variants as well as emergence of new variants under cell culturing conditions have also been reported for TBEV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">In vitro characterization of LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> and LGTV<sub>Lab</sub> showed that the peak levels of LGTV RNA reached quicker in A549 cells as compared to Vero cells. In contrary, Vero cells exhibited lower cytotoxicity and higher virus titers as compared to A549 cells. In addition, production of defective virus particles was lower in Vero cells as compared to A549 cells. These differences in growth kinetics and specific infectivity could be related to the differences in the immune profiles of these cell lines. A549 cells are known to produce interferon whereas Vero cells are deficient in type I interferon production, which makes Vero cells more compatible for virus cultivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The comparison of in vitro growth kinetics of both LGTV strains revealed that both the genomic RNA and infectious titers of LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> were slightly lower than those of LGTV<sub>Lab</sub>. Notably, LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> also exhibited significantly lower in vitro cytotoxicity. The combination of reduced viral replication and lower cytotoxicity is particularly appealing for development of a live-attenuated TBE vaccine, as replication-defective viruses have effectively been used as live-attenuated viral vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">In a murine model, LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> infection was associated with an initial decline in body weight followed by recovery and progressive increase over time, but it was significantly lower than LGTV<sub>Lab</sub> and control mice, at the termination of the experiment. The difference in the weight development of mice infected with LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> and LGTV<sub>Lab</sub> could be due to genetic differences between the two viruses. In addition, the initial decline in body weight may be due to the activation of the early immune responses, including cytokine release and inflammatory responses, which are essential for protection against infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. A steadier increase in body weight of mice in LGTV<sub>Lab</sub> group as compared to those in LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> group, reflects better tolerance of the former. This more attenuated phenotype of LGTV<sub>Lab</sub> as compared to LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> could be attributed to the passage history of the virus because serial passaging is a well-documented method for virus attenuation, particularly in the development of live-attenuated vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

Additionally, the localized irritation observed in one mouse in this study is the most common reaction to intramuscular administration, which is generally not serious and fades away by itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This reaction could be avoided by using another administration route such as mucosal administration, which requires further research.</p><p id="Par19">To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the viremia kinetics of a laboratory adapted and a rescued IC of LGTV TP21 strain in a murine model. To study viremia kinetics, blood samples were collected at 1, 6 and 48&#x02009;h from 50% of the mice and at 3, 24, and 72&#x02009;h from the remaining 50% animals in each group. Blood sampling from different mice may have introduced variability in viremia assessment. This was done according to the ethical guidelines where a maximum blood volume of 8&#x02009;&#x003bc;L/g is allowed to be sampled over a period of 14 days. This equates to approximately 53&#x02009;&#x003bc;L/time-point for the in-life samples, provided that the animals weigh 20&#x02009;g. A recent study by Ahmed et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> investigated LGTV acquisition dynamics in female C57BL/6 mice by intraperitoneal inoculation with 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> FFU of LGTV.

In contrast, our data demonstrated that both LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> and LGTV<sub>Lab</sub> reached peak viremia at 2 dpi and the virus was subsequently cleared by 3 dpi. The differences between our findings and those of Ahmed et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> may be attributed to the different viral doses and administration routes used in the two studies. Notably, LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> exhibited a lower viremia level compared to LGTV<sub>Lab</sub>. These findings advocate further investigation of LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> as a potential vaccine candidate, because it exhibited efficient replication and rapid viral clearance that may minimize adverse effects in vivo.</p><p id="Par20">Live-attenuated vaccines have been successful in protecting from yellow fever, Dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

In this study, we selected LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> for further in vitro and in vivo characterization because DNA-based methods offer higher stability compared to RNA-based methods, and it saves time and resources to generate additional LGTV ICs for the purpose of developing a live-attenuated TBE vaccine. The level of anti-TBEV IgG antibodies produced by LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> was comparable to that of LGTV<sub>Lab</sub>. The induction of immune response by LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> to produce cross-reactive anti-TBEV antibodies highlight its potential to develop a live-attenuated TBE vaccine. We used a single dose to evaluate immunogenicity in mice which may limit the interpretation of the immunogenicity of our vaccine candidate. However, the clinical trials of live LGTV conducted in 1970s, showed that a single dose of live vaccine produced long-lasting seroconversion in 100% of individuals, as reviewed by Gritsun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">In conclusion, LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> that was rescued by DNA-based reverse genetics method showed higher genetic stability during rescue and cell culturing, it closely resembled LGTV<sub>Lab</sub> in terms of in vitro and in vivo replication kinetics, and it induced a humoral immune response in mice which was comparable to LGTV<sub>Lab</sub>. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential use of LGTV<sub>DNA+L&#x02013;2000</sub> as a platform for vaccine development.
