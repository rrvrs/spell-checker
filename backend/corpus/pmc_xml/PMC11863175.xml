Initially delineated by Schultz in 1927 as a variant of odontogenic keratocysts [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], it is presently classified as a keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT) [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. An OOC is characterized by distinctive histopathological attributes and clinical tendencies. Its histogenesis is believed to arise either from the vestiges of the dental lamina or the basal cell layer of the oral mucosal epithelium [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Empirical data suggests that male individuals exhibited a higher predilection than females, commonly manifesting this lesion during the third and fourth decades [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The mandible is affected twice as frequently as the maxilla [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Radiographically, the cyst manifests as a precisely demarcated, either solitary or multilocular radiolucent lesion, occasionally exhibiting an association with either an impacted tooth or the root, without inducing resorption [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The selection of treatment is contingent upon the cyst's dimensions, recurrence risk status, and the radiographic documentation of cortical perforation [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The recurrence rate of OOC is notably low, obviating the necessity for invasive therapeutic modalities. Conservative methods suffice for the management of OOC [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>This report endeavors to explicate the diagnostic criteria, surgical intricacies, and resultant outcomes inherent to OOCs. Intriguingly, the case reported involves a female patient with an OOC in the maxilla.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 34-year-old female patient presented to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery with the chief complaint of recurrent episodes of dull and intermittent pain in the upper right posterior tooth region, persisting over the past four months. The patient's medical history revealed that she had a preexisting physical disability due to polio. Moreover, she had been undergoing psychiatric treatment for the preceding two months. Notably, the patient also disclosed a history of trauma that occurred four years prior.</p><p>Upon intraoral examination, a firm and tender swelling measuring approximately 2x3 cm was detected in the alveolar mucosa of the maxillary right posterior region (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Intraoral examination reveals a 2x3 cm swelling in the right posterior region of the maxilla.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078052-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>The patient exhibited mild to moderate tenderness in the zygomaticomaxillary buttress. Orthopantomography (OPG) revealed a lesion in the maxillary right posterior tooth region. It presented as a well-defined, unilocular radiolucency (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The cyst's periphery was well-defined and corticated, and it was associated with the cemento-enamel junction in relation to tooth 18. The maxillary sinus exhibited displacement due to the impaction of teeth 18 and 28.&#x000a0;</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>(a) Preoperative orthopantomograph (OPG) showing unilocular well defined radiolucency in maxillary posterior tooth region. (b) CBCT showing unilocular lesion in right posterior maxilla. (c) Intraoral periapical radiograph showing well-defined radiolucency.</title><p>CVCT: cone-beam computed tomography</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078052-i02" position="float"/></fig><p>Following cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) analysis, a unilocular, low-density lesion became apparent in the right posterior maxilla (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), measuring approximately 13.7 mm buccolingually, 24.3 mm anteroposteriorly, and 31.0 mm superoinferiorly in its greatest dimension. The lesion exhibited substantial biocritical expansion. Furthermore, a hyperdense, tooth-like structure was identified within the lesion, with the impacted tooth situated approximately 11.8 mm above the alveolus of the maxilla in relation to tooth 18. The impacted tooth was firmly adhered to the distal wall of the maxillary sinus. Notable findings encompassed opacification of the right maxillary sinus with cortical perforation. Importantly, there was no indication of root resorption. In light of the orthopantomogram and CBCT analysis, the findings strongly suggested the presence of a dentigerous cyst.&#x000a0;</p><p>The intraoral periapical radiograph (IOPA) revealed that the lesion extended from the right second premolar to the right second molar (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), with the presence of an impacted third molar. Furthermore, there was a well-defined periapical radiolucency noted in relation to teeth 15-17.</p><p>The patient was scheduled for the enucleation of the cyst under local anesthesia, and written informed consent was duly obtained. The planned procedure was performed under local anesthesia. The treatment involved the enucleation process, which commenced with a vestibular incision made in relation to teeth 13-17, and a mucoperiosteal flap was raised (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). A window opening was created on the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus in relation to teeth 13-17, measuring 2 cm &#x000d7; 1 cm (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The cystic content was aspirated using an 18-gauge needle, revealing a serosanguinous fluid, after which the cystic lining was meticulously removed and detached from the bone (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The impacted tooth was extracted from the cavity (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Tincture benzoin, along with roller gauze, was applied (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>), and a simple interrupted suture was placed using 3-0 Vicryl, with the end of the roller gauze left in place to facilitate the process (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>(a) Elevated mucoperiosteal flap following a vestibular incision.

The packing was replaced during the weekly recall visits for three months following the initial surgery. Immediately after the enucleation, the specimen was sent for histopathological examination. The histopathological diagnosis indicated the presence of an OOC with evidence of inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>An OOC is an infrequent and developmental odontogenic cyst originating from the dental lamina [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In 1981, Wright coined the term "orthokeratinized variant of OKC," delineating it as a distinct clinical entity [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It was not until 1998 that Li et al. proposed the term OOC, which has since become the widely accepted nomenclature [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. OOCs comprise 7-17% of all keratinizing jaw cysts [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. OOCs are usually asymptomatic, and slow-growing swelling is the most frequent presenting symptom, occasionally accompanied by pain [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In our case, the primary concern was recurrent episodes of dull and intermittent pain. Radiographically, OOCs appear as radiolucent solitary lesions which are frequently associated with impacted teeth [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Histologically, OOC is characterized by a consistently stratified squamous epithelium, ranging from four to nine layers in thickness [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the present case, the histological examination revealed a lining epithelium that was orthokeratinized, exhibiting uniform thickness spanning three to eight layers; the basal layer exhibited palisade cuboidal or flat cells displaying nuclear hyperchromatism (Figure <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Histopathology reveals a lining epithelium that is orthokeratinized and the basal layer exhibits cuboidal cells, suggestive of orthokeratinized odontogenic cyst</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078052-i04" position="float"/></fig><p>The intermediate layer comprises polyhedral cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and a prominent superficial layer of orthokeratin. In contrast, the keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT) displays an epithelium spanning 5-10 layers, with basal cells featuring elongated nuclei and a distinctive superficial corrugated layer of parakeratin. The comprehensive differential diagnosis of OOC encompasses various radiolucent lesions within the jaws, primarily odontogenic entities such as dentigerous cysts or paradental cysts. In addition to these, consideration should be given to odontogenic tumors, including ameloblastoma and KCOT. Notably, OOC exhibits analogous radiographic features to both ameloblastoma and KCOT [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Two universally acknowledged approaches for treating OKC and OOC are resection or enucleation coupled with peripheral ostectomy and decompression [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the current case, the therapeutic course for OOC involved enucleation, ensuring complete excision of the cyst, coupled with the surgical extraction of impacted teeth. Due to the low recurrence of OOC, its treatment plan is conservative and enucleation is the recommended method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>OOCs present a rare yet potentially malignant condition that demands careful management by oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Differentiating OOC from other lesions, particularly odontogenic keratocysts (OKC), is crucial due to differences in treatment and prognosis. Diagnosis remains challenging, requiring a thorough comparison of radiolucent jaw lesions. Treatment typically involves enucleation with curettage, offering an excellent prognosis with low recurrence rates compared to other lesions. Overall, precise diagnosis and tailored surgical intervention are key to ensuring optimal outcomes in managing OOC.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; A.
