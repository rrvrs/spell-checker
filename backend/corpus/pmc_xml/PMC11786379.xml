As social media is essential in the daily life of adolescents, gaining a better understanding of the impact of negative online events on NSSI urges and behaviors, distinct from that of real-life events, is warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We recruited 25 adolescents with a history of NSSI and 25 healthy controls. Participants reported on their stress, affect, and NSSI urges four times daily over seven days using ambulatory assessment. We examined the immediate effects of negative events in real-life and on social media on these psychological outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In adolescents who engage in NSSI, negative events on social media were positively associated with perceived stress, negative affect, and NSSI urges to a greater extent than real-life negative events. However, NSSI events during the sampling period were mostly triggered by real-life events. While the frequency of social media use was generally similar between groups, those with NSSI reported experiencing more negative events on social media.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Our findings highlight the significant impact of social media on the mental health of adolescents who engage in NSSI, possibly exacerbating stress and negative affect more than real-life events. These results underscore the need for targeted interventions addressing online interactions to mitigate NSSI behaviors and improve adolescent mental health.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">This study has been registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (ID: DRKS00025905, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drks.de/search/en/trial/DRKS00025905">https://drks.de/search/en/trial/DRKS00025905</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40479-025-00280-9.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Nonsuicidal self-injury</kwd><kwd>Ambulatory assessment</kwd><kwd>Social media</kwd><kwd>Interpersonal stress</kwd><kwd>Adolescents</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KLI963</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par12">Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is defined as the deliberate and repetitive infliction of bodily harm without an observable intention to die [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. NSSI behaviors encompass cutting, scratching, or burning one&#x02019;s own body tissue, as well as striking or punching objects with sufficient force to cause bruising or bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Global prevalence estimates of NSSI among adolescents range from 16 to 17% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] up to lifetime prevalence rates of 23% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], with a peak occurrence between ages 15 and 17, followed by a decrease in young adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Adolescent NSSI has significant repercussions beyond its immediate impact on mental health, including increased healthcare and economic costs, productivity loss, heightened morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and it is a significant predictor of subsequent suicide attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].
</p><p id="Par13">Many biological and neurological models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] posit that NSSI serves to regulate affect and stress (intrapersonal functions). There are, however, also interpersonal social functions, such as influencing the behavior of others or affecting the person&#x02019;s relationship with others, that are suggested to be relevant underlying functions of NSSI behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Moreover, research indicates significant differences in stress and affective experiences between individuals who engage in NSSI and healthy controls, with the former group often using NSSI as an immediate coping mechanism to alleviate negative emotions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Intrapersonal vs. interpersonal triggers of NSSI</title><p id="Par14">The question of what precipitates or triggers NSSI acts in the first place, however, has not received as much attention. Studies have shown that negative intrapersonal states, such as perceived stress or negative affect, are higher in those who engage in NSSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and robustly predict NSSI urges, leading to subsequent NSSI acts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This relationship, however, is not as clearly established with regard to interpersonal triggers, such as rejection, social conflict, or criticism. A recent systematic review of interpersonal processes in self-injurious thoughts and behaviors concluded that, overall, studies on the impact of these processes in daily life, as assessed via experience sampling, remain inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Evidence from qualitative accounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x0feff;], cross-sectional studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and daily life studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] supports the notion that interpersonal events, alongside intrapersonal factors such as affect or stress regulation, often trigger NSSI. However, the comparative impact of intra- versus interpersonal triggers has not been directly examined, particularly in adolescents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Real-life vs. social media negative events</title><p id="Par15">Another critical aspect that remains insufficiently explored is the distinction between triggering events occurring in real-life and those occurring on social media platforms. Social media is commonly defined as digital platforms facilitating social interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These encompass a variety of tools, including social networking sites and apps, such as Facebook, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter); messaging services such as WhatsApp; online forums and communities like Reddit; and video-sharing platforms such as YouTube and TikTok. The content shared on social media often includes images that can heighten NSSI urges and may lead to self-injurious behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Qualitative findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] indicate that viewing NSSI-related depictions (e.g., wounds, blood, razors) on social media increases urges, a finding supported by highly controlled laboratory studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A recent review of 15 studies on the impact of viewing self-harm images on the internet or social media concluded that, while some studies reported positive effects, harmful effects were more prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Social media, therefore, presents a potential intrapersonal trigger, as reading text or viewing pictures can increase negative affect and/or NSSI urges.</p><p id="Par16">As social life and communication also increasingly occur on social media, negative interpersonal events often transpire there [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The rapid advancement of technology, coupled with the pervasive use of social media among youth&#x02014;where these platforms have become central to their interactions and relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]&#x02014;has raised significant concerns regarding the impact of social media on adolescent mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Outside of social media, negative events in daily life have indeed been found to increase negative affect or stress&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and critically, NSSI urges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, it remains unclear whether negative events occurring in real-life or on social media have a comparable impact on affect or stress and NSSI urges in the daily lives of individuals who engage in NSSI, particularly among today's youth who are fluent in social media use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Present study</title><p id="Par17">The present study aims to elucidate the differential effects of negative (intra- and interpersonal) events in real-life and on social media in the daily lives of adolescents who engage in NSSI and healthy controls. We assessed the characteristics of negative events (i.e., intra- and interpersonal), where they occurred (in real-life or on social media), and their impact on stress, affect, and NSSI urges in adolescents using an ambulatory assessment design over seven days. Self-report data collected in real-time via smartphones multiple times daily through ambulatory assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] has provided valuable insights into the antecedents and consequences of NSSI, primarily in adult samples (see, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]). It also allows for examining patterns over time, as previous studies suggest that environmental factors, such as the time of day, may be associated with NSSI acts, urges, and affect, with higher negative affect and increased urges occurring later in the day (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]).</p><p id="Par18">It remains unclear whether adolescents engaging in NSSI experience more or fewer daily stressors compared to healthy adolescents, or if both groups are equally affected by real-life and social media stressors. However, based on experience sampling data, adolescents with NSSI exhibit greater affective instability&#x02014;rapid and intense fluctuations in affect&#x02014;throughout their days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This increased affective instability possibly leads them to react more intensely, even though the frequency of daily stressors may not differ from that experienced by healthy adolescents. Furthermore, negative affect often precedes NSSI in these individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. To address this gap, we recruited adolescents who engage in NSSI and a healthy control group to concurrently assess NSSI acts and negative events, enabling a direct comparison of the context and impact of these events across different settings. Specifically, we aimed to address the following research questions:</p><p id="Par19">First, we examined whether the overall within-days trajectories of perceived stress, affect, and NSSI urges in the daily lives of adolescents who engage in NSSI are greater than those of healthy controls. Specifically, we hypothesized that adolescents engaging in NSSI would exhibit higher mean levels of these variables compared to healthy controls over the sampling period. Second, we investigated the triggers of NSSI, aiming to distinguish between intra- and interpersonal events as well as real-life and social media contexts, and to assess their impact on stress, affect, and NSSI urges in participants who engage in NSSI. Third, we explored how and to what extent adolescents who engage in NSSI differ from healthy controls in their responses to negative events in real-life compared to those on social media, focusing on stress, affect, and NSSI urges. In the third research question, we also expected an a priori difference; that is, adolescents with NSSI report a higher impact of negative events&#x02014;irrespective of their kind&#x02014;on our outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Method</title><p id="Par20">This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna (1651/2019). Written consent was obtained from participants and their legal guardian(s) prior to participation.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par21">Participants (aged 14&#x02013;18) were recruited to form two groups: individuals with a history of NSSI or who were currently engaging in NSSI, and healthy controls without a history of lifetime NSSI. The NSSI participants were primarily patients at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, Austria. Healthy controls were recruited from the general public and schools in Vienna and surrounding areas. Recruitment took place from November 2022 to June 2023. The recruitment process utilized multiple methods, including the dissemination of posters, social media advertisements for the healthy control group, and outreach to psychiatric and psychological practitioners in both the private and public health sectors for the NSSI group. To be eligible for the study, participants had to meet specific inclusion criteria: individuals had to be within the age range of 14&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years. For the NSSI group, participants were required to have a history of at least five NSSI episodes (i.e., self-inflicted damage to body tissue) occurring on at least five separate days within the previous year. Participants who required acute treatment for conditions such as acute psychosis, acute suicidality, or present acute danger of harm to themselves or others were excluded. For the control group, participants were included if they were within the specified age range, reported no lifetime history of NSSI, and had no current or past mental or physical disorders, as confirmed through interviews with both the participants and their caregivers. A total of 30 adolescents with NSSI and 28 healthy controls were screened for inclusion. Of these, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3 were excluded because they did not respond after initial contact or loss of interest (all in the NSSI group), and <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 were excluded because their legal guardian(s) did not provide consent for their child's participation (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2 in the NSSI group, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3 in the control group). Our trial registration targeted a final sample size of 50 participants, i.e., 25 per group (NSSI and healthy controls), and recruitment was, therefore, halted upon reaching this target. The final sample size of <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50 was selected to accommodate the high number of inpatient cases in our clinical setting and to adhere to Maas and Hox's [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] minimal recommendations for level 2 grouping variables in multilevel ambulatory assessment analyses.

During this session, participants completed baseline measures and were trained in the use of the ambulatory assessment software. The ambulatory assessment software utilized in this study was the movisensXS app (Movisens GmbH). Participants either downloaded the app onto their personal phones or were provided with a study phone for the duration of the study when necessary. Additionally, participants received a study manual containing detailed information regarding the sampling protocol, the meaning of items, and contact details for any questions or technical difficulties.</p><p id="Par23">The ambulatory assessment period commenced the following day and lasted for seven consecutive days. A seven-day period was selected to balance the need for capturing daily fluctuations with the practical considerations of participant compliance to capture a comprehensive and representative sample of their daily experiences. Participants were alerted by an auditory signal to answer questions four times per day: once randomly between 10:00 am and 11:59 am, and three times from 12:00&#x000a0;pm through 8:00&#x000a0;pm, with at least one hour between two subsequent prompts and the possibility to postpone a data entry for a maximum delay of 30&#x000a0;min. The compliance rate for daily assessments was 66%, and did not differ considerably between the groups (NSSI: 65%; control: 67%). In addition to the regular assessments, participants were instructed to report any NSSI acts throughout the assessment period using the same app (event sampling). Upon completion of the study, participants were invited to our laboratories for a post-participation interview and to return the study phones, if provided.

Using an ambulatory assessment design, we explored an array of psychological outcomes and how they were affected by negative events directly in the daily lives of adolescents. Our findings indicate that negative events occurring on social media significantly exacerbate perceived stress, negative affect, and NSSI urges more than do negative events occurring in real-life among adolescents who engage in NSSI. Conversely, this was not the case in our sample of healthy controls, where those adolescents reported a negative&#x02014;albeit lower than the NSSI group's&#x02014;impact of either negative event, whether on social media or in real life, on stress and negative affect. Our findings, thus, underscore the potent influence of social media on the mental health and behavior of adolescents who engage in NSSI.</p><p id="Par49">Consistent with other studies, we found in Research Question 1 that being in the NSSI group&#x02014;compared with the control group&#x02014;was associated with heightened stress, higher negative affect, and lower positive affect, even without considering negative events of any kind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Both stress and negative affect (such as feelings of hopelessness, guilt, and rejection) are frequently reported to be linked with NSSI engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, our direct comparisons between affective states in adolescents with NSSI and healthy controls confirm this notion and underscore the psychological distress reported by individuals who engage in NSSI.</p><p id="Par50">With respect to actual NSSI acts, studies have found that people who engage in NSSI find it difficult to explicitly recognize interpersonal motives for engagement in NSSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], even in ambulatory assessment designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. We, however, found in Research Question 2 that two-thirds of NSSI acts were attributed to interpersonal conflict. One possibility for this difference from other studies (which report relatively fewer social triggers and more intrapersonal ones, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) is that participants in our study were given the opportunity to write their reasons in open-ended response fields (and not choose from a pre-defined list), potentially elaborating on their motives. Furthermore, all but one NSSI act was attributed to real-life events. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that negative events on social media may increase NSSI urges by elevating stress and negative affect, whereas actual NSSI behaviors may be more directly triggered by immediate and severe real-life stressors. Thus, online negative events could influence internal emotional states, while tangible real-life stressors might prompt self-injurious actions. However, on the basis of the low prevalence of NSSI acts in our study, this remains speculative and requires further research. A majority of everyday life studies in this field also rely on adult populations (which are less socially active on social media than adolescents are), which may contribute to the higher prevalence of social functions of NSSI engagement in adolescents.</p><p id="Par51">To our knowledge, this is the first study directly assessing the effects of negative events on social media (compared to real-life negative events) on stress, affect and NSSI urges in adolescents with NSSI (Research Question 3). Generally, it is assumed that youth with a history of NSSI are more susceptible to the adverse effects of negative social media interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which can exacerbate emotional distress and NSSI urges and even NSSI behaviors. Furthermore, viewing self-harm images can negatively impact NSSI behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. We found that adolescents with NSSI and healthy controls used social media with very similar frequency (during 67% and 64% of all assessments, respectively) but those with NSSI reported more negative events while using social media. It is noteworthy that internet or social media use can also be used positively to connect and support each other in online NSSI groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For the purpose of our study, we focused (and thus instructed participants) only to report negative events on social media and may therefore have missed additional and potentially positive functions of internet/social media use. Negative events in real-life were also more frequent for the NSSI group, with nearly three times as many reported. Due to the relatively low number of occurrences on social media, we were, unfortunately, unable to directly compare the impact of intra- and interpersonal functions and may only give an overview of the overall impact. However, we note that more than two-thirds of all reported negative events&#x02014;whether in real life or on social media&#x02014;were of an interpersonal nature. Interpersonal events are, therefore, very often a trigger for NSSI urges and lead to them in line with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]&#x02014;a finding that we were overall able to corroborate. Overall, we found that potentially triggering negative social media events have a more pronounced impact on stress and negative affect than real-life events in adolescents who engaged in NSSI compared to healthy controls.</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p id="Par52">This study has several limitations that should be considered. First, the sample size, while adequate for detecting significant effects and similar to other daily life studies in this area of research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], was relatively small, and the findings may not generalize to all people or even all adolescents who engage in NSSI. Second, NSSI acts were not that common in our sample, which is similar to other daily life studies in this area (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). Third, most analyses were contemporaneous, preventing us from establishing the directionality or causality between negative events and NSSI urges. Consequently, NSSI urges may have prompted adolescents to seek out NSSI-related content on social media, or increased social withdrawal during high NSSI urges may have led to greater exposure to negative online events, rather than negative events causing the urges. Additionally, the potential for alpha error accumulation should be acknowledged, as multiple statistical tests increase the risk of Type I errors. On a similar note, future research could replicate our findings regarding the differential impact of social media and real-life triggering factors, and actually compare inter- and intrapersonal events. Future investigations should also aim to include more diverse samples to improve the generalizability of the results. Our adolescents in the NSSI group were primarily in mental health care and, therefore, might not fully represent all adolescents who engage in NSSI. Lastly, the reliance on self-reported data for both negative events and emotional states may introduce bias. Incorporating objective measures, such as physiological indicators of stress, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of negative events on NSSI behaviors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par53">In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into the differential impacts of negative events in real-life and on social media on adolescents who engage in NSSI and healthy controls. Our findings highlight the heightened vulnerability of adolescents who engage in NSSI to social media-induced stress and underscore the importance of addressing online interactions in both clinical and policy contexts. Given the significant role of social media in adolescents' lives, these findings have several practical implications for mental health interventions and policies. Clinicians should incorporate discussions of social media use into their therapeutic work with adolescents who engage in NSSI and talk about strategies to manage their reactions to negative online interactions and limit their exposure to triggering content, which could be crucial components of effective NSSI interventions. Furthermore, we echo recommendations that social networks implement stringent content moderation protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and that educational institutions and community organizations implement programs to increase awareness of the impact of ostracism and exclusion in digital environments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
