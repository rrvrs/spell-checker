We aim to validate the usability of a dedicated certified system for this purpose.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>All cases prepared with MxR in our center in 2022 were prospectively collected. Holographic rendering was achieved using an incorporated fully automatic algorithm in the MxR application, combined with contrast-based semiautomatic rendering and/or manual segmentation where necessary. Hologram segmentation times were documented. Visualization during surgical preparation (defined as the interval between finalized anesthesiological induction and sterile draping) was performed using MxR glasses and direct streaming to a side screen. Surgical preparation times were compared with a matched historical cohort of 2021. Modifications of the surgical approach after 3-dimensional (3D) visualization were noted. Usability was assessed by evaluating 7 neurosurgeons with more than 3 months of experience with the system using a Usefulness, Satisfaction and Ease of use (USE) questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>One hundred-seven neurosurgical cases prepared with a 3D hologram were collected. Surgical indications were oncologic (63/107, 59%), cerebrovascular (27/107, 25%), and carotid endarterectomy (17/107, 16%). Mean hologram segmentation time was 39.4 &#x000b1; 20.4 minutes. Average surgical preparation time was 48.0 &#x000b1; 17.3 minutes for MxR cases vs 52 &#x000b1; 17 minutes in the matched 2021 cohort without MxR (mean difference 4, 95% CI 1.7527-9.7527). Based on the 3D hologram, the surgical approach was modified in 3 cases. Good usability was found by 57% of the users.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION:</title><p>The perioperative use of 3D holograms improved direct anatomic visualization while not significantly increasing intraoperative surgical preparation time. Usability of the system was adequate. Further technological development is necessary to improve the automatic algorithms and reduce the preparation time by circumventing manual and semiautomatic segmentation. Future studies should focus on quantifying the potential benefits in teaching, training, and the impact on surgical and functional outcomes.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p><fig position="float" id="FU1"><graphic xlink:href="ons-26-551-g001" position="float"/></fig>

Among the different forms of AR, mixed reality (MxR) has been emerging in neurosurgery.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In MxR, 3D objects called holograms recapitulate the patient-specific cerebral anatomy and can be superimposed directly on the real patient. This technology has the potential to improve anatomic visualization, surgical planning, and resident training, and therefore serve as a valuable mean to rehearse and plan the important steps of the surgery.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>The implementation of MxR has been promoted with success in different subfields of neurosurgery.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Indeed, the use of 3D interactive holograms superimposable to the real world augments the anatomic perception and helps intraoperative orientation.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, 3D holograms allow not only experienced neurosurgeons but also, and especially, residents to rehearse the surgical steps, plan patient positioning and the surgical trajectories, and gain stronger surgical confidence.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Nonetheless, the use of MxR in the routine neurosurgical practice is still not as diffuse as expected. In the past, a major limitation to the widespread use of MxR have been represented by the restrictions in computational and graphics processing ability.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Nowadays, a precise evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of MxR is still difficult, given the ongoing experimental nature of the technology.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Segmentation is the fundamental step to produce high-quality 3D holograms. It can be divided into 3 groups: manual, semiautomatic, and automatic, the last group being potentially faster than the other 2 options because it does not require any user input. To make the use of a MxR system adaptable to the routine surgical planning and the use of neurosurgeons at all levels of experience, the workflow must be mostly, if not fully, automatic and require the least amount of steps to reach the goal. The incorporation of algorithms for the automatic recognition of anatomic structures, such as skin, brain, ventricles, and tumors, in a cloud environment facilitates the workflow and eliminates the need of inputs from the users and of high-power local computers.</p><p>In the settings of digitalization of medicine and the growing drive toward 3D visualization of medical imaging, the interest to apply MxR in the form of 3D interactive holograms for surgical planning, case rehearsal, and training in neurosurgery is manifest and it is increasing. Nevertheless, this technology is still developing and there is a lack of studies focusing on its applicability in the clinical routine.</p><p>We present the first single-center experience gathered after routine implementation in 2022 of such a cloud-based MxR neurosurgical preparation system (Lumi, Augmedit bv) on 107 consecutive neurosurgical cases. This study endorses the applicability of MxR to routine neurosurgical planning, case rehearsal, and training.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>METHODS</title><p>Swiss ethics approved this study (BASEC nr Reg-2022-01015). All patients provided consent for imaging data use for this study under general KEK PB_2017_00093/NCT01628406.</p><p>The intraoperative use of the MxR system still represents an off-label use.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Prospective Patients' Cohort</title><p>All patients who underwent an elective neurosurgical procedure in our Institution from January 2022 to December 2022 and for whom a hologram was prepared on request of the primary surgeon were included. Simple demographic data, ie, age at the time of surgery, and data regarding the surgical procedures were collected. Surgical preparation time was measured, defined as the time from the end of anesthesia induction to the beginning of the surgical procedure. This parameter was also measured in a historical cohort of cases performed in 2021. The 2021's cases were matched according to the indication of the surgical procedure (elective), the type pf the neurosurgical pathology, and the primary operating neurosurgeons.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Segmentation and Holographic Rendering</title><p>Automatic segmentation of ventricles, major dural sinuses, brain, skull, skin, and eventual tumor was performed by means of an expanding meshes algorithm that was previously described and validated (Disior).<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The algorithm used 3D adaptive spheres that capture the radiological boundaries of different tissues. For each source imaging scan, the algorithm was specifically tailored to the patient by preprocessing using region, threshold, and histogram-based segmentation methods (9). This algorithm was run in a cloud environment that provided direct MxR output (Lumi, Augmedit bv). If subsequent structures were requested or automatic output was insufficient, semiautomatic contrast-based and full manual slice-by-slice segmentation of anatomic structures of interest was performed on 3D Slicer (3D Slicer image computing platform|3D Slicer) by the first author. The manual segmentations were converted to 3D surface models and exported as stereolithography files into the cloud environment. The resulting hologram was visualized using the HoloLens 2 (Microsoft Corporation) and the view of the primary user was directly streamed to a side screen in the operation room using Miracast (Microsoft Corporation).</p><p>Therefore, the novel MxR system used for holographic rendering and 3D visualization consisted primarily of a Conformit&#x000e9; Europ&#x000e9;enne-certified cloud environment, which provided a direct MxR output by means of a validated expanding meshes algorithm. A further component was the associated application for MxR glasses, which represented the main tool for 3D visualization of the hologram.</p><p>In the application Lumi for Microsoft Hololens 2, the surgeon could subsequently review the position the patient, place an incision, place a trajectory, and perform a trepanation with hologram manually placed next or onto the patient head (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Video).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>A</bold>, Matching of the hologram with the patient's head in the operating room and <bold>B</bold>&#x02013;<bold>D</bold>, exemplifying preoperative and intraoperative hologram's use.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ons-26-551-g002" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Applicability of the System</title><p>Seven board-qualified neurosurgeons with a minimum of 3 months of experience with the system were questioned.

Four of the 7 (57%) interviewed neurosurgeons gave a mean score equal or above 5 to all 4 categories. Among the most negative aspects of the system listed by the tested neurosurgeons, the most recurrent was the nonideal manual mechanism to match the hologram with the head of the patients (5/7, 71%), which may be imprecise and need adjustments, therefore requiring time. This comment was followed in frequency by the dependence of the system on a good internet connection (2/7, 29%). The most frequent greatest positive aspect of the system was the better understanding of the anatomy and the pathology, thanks to the holographic 3D visualization (5/7, 71%). The second most frequent (3/7, 43%) positive aspect for the 7 neurosurgeons was the ease of use of the system.

availability of Conformit&#x000e9; Europ&#x000e9;enne-certified MxR systems, the routine implementation of MxR may have the potential to improve intraoperative efficiency and the outcomes of surgery. The current prospective collection of cases is, to our knowledge, the most extensive to study a Conformit&#x000e9; Europ&#x000e9;enne-approved MxR system for neurosurgical preparation. As an initial step, we focused on usability, user feedback, and influence on surgical preparation.</p><p>Other groups have published on the implementation of AR systems in the workflow of specific neurosurgical procedures and pathologies with the aim of evaluating usability and added value. Moon et al used MxR for multidisciplinary awake craniotomy planning in 10 consecutive cases and endorsed the use of MxR showing acceptable usability and benefit for surgical rehearsal.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The group of Sugiyama et al published in 2020 their experience on the use of an immersive virtual reality (VR) system implemented for the presurgical discussion and preparation of 18 cerebrovascular cases. They endorsed the value of VR to improve patient-specific anatomic understanding, surgical strategy in complex cases, and training for less experienced neurosurgeons.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Recently, Zawy Alsofy et al published the experience gathered with surgical planning using VR in different neurosurgical subfields, including neuro-oncology, vascular, and spine.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Their results supported the conclusion that VR only moderately affected conventional patient positioning but it did help better detection of pathology-specific anatomic relationships. The use of AR has also been extended to intraoperative visualization of major anatomic landmarks, as documented by Bernard et al,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> to improve periventricular structure preservation in 13 cases of tumor removal.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Impact of MxR on the Surgical Routine</title><p>The present analysis shows that the application of the tested MxR system in the operating room during the nonsterile preparation phase does not increase the surgical preparation time. Time required by the above-mentioned process may have indeed had a negative impact on the surgical preparation timing, ie, increasing it, thus affecting also the total surgical timing. This aspect may implicate that a more precise preoperative 3D visualization could not only provide a better anatomic understanding but also the development of a more definitive preoperative plan (surgical approach and patient positioning namely), thus improving efficiency of surgical planning. Furthermore, the increasing frequency of application of this technology over the course of the year demonstrated the positive perception of the neurosurgeons and established its role as a beneficial adjunct of surgical planning.</p><p>Indeed, the most significant contribution of the tested MxR workflow was seen in the 3 cases, for which the perioperative 3D study helped optimizing surgical approach and patient positioning, thus the intraoperative trajectory. Three cases represent a relative small percentage compared with the total number of procedures included in this study; nevertheless, the 3D interactive holograms added a better specific anatomic understanding and provided experienced neurosurgeons with what they considered an improved surgical planning and intraoperative strategy. With further and more extensive application of this technology, it may have the potential to objectively influence other procedures and therefore improve surgical and functional outcomes in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Users' Experience and Satisfaction</title><p>The analysis of the data gathered through the USE questionnaires documented overall a good usability of the system and users' satisfaction. Currently, there is no standardized usability assessment for AR systems. Nonetheless, the goals of the present analysis' evaluation method are aligned to the ones of the previous studies, aiming mainly to evaluate usefulness, ease of use and learning, confidence of the users with system, and users' satisfaction.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A further recurrent aspect was the identification of an improved anatomic understanding as the most relevant benefit of the application of MxR to surgical planning and preparation.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Indeed, the younger colleagues interviewed provided overall the most positive appraisal of the system and its perioperative application. The resulting implication may be that the greatest value of MxR implemented for surgical planning and rehearsal is mostly evident during neurosurgical training and for less experienced neurosurgeons. A bigger cohort of interviewed neurosurgeons with different levels of experience would be necessary to confirm this theory.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations of the System</title><p>Working with the current MxR system still included some drawbacks. First, the degree of manual segmentation necessary to produce high-quality holograms is still quite high in the present cohort, with at least 1 manually segmented anatomic structure in more than 50% of the included cases in all 3 categories (ie,: vascular, oncologic, and CEAs). Ideally, this should be reduced by improving the current algorithms and developing new ones. Machine learning could be used for both purposes. Furthermore, the algorithm for automatic segmentation of skin, brain, ventricles, and tumors used in the present analysis (Disior) works with indirect training of data and it is optimized for contrast-enhanced tumors with a minimum volume of 5 cubed-cm on T1-weighted imaging. These features require a larger data set to improve the sensitivity of the algorithm for smaller tumors.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Another limitation is intrinsic to the nature of the quality of the imaging. In fact, segmentation of vessels with a diameter below 1 mm and the smallest anatomic structures, such as cranial nerves other than the ophthalmic and the trigeminus, was not possible. Indeed, the algorithm for automatic segmentation used in this study is not designed to recognize arterial vascular structures. This is not solely a limitation of this study. Given the intrinsic anatomic difficulty in segmenting small intracranial arteries, gold standard algorithms to provide automatic and successful segmentation of cerebral are still a work in progress.</p><p>Further limitations of the system have emerged after testing neurosurgeons using it for more than 3 months; in fact, the matching of the hologram with the head of the patient is currently manual, thus requiring an input from the user and care to make it as precise as possible. Another relevant limitation expressed by the neurosurgeons is the influence of a good internet connection to the performance of the MxR system.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, all the 107 included cases have been selected from a single neurosurgical tertiary referral center with a relevant caseload, expertise, and high adaptation to new technological developments, leading to a selection bias. Furthermore, all included cases represent surgeries performed in an elective regime and no emergency procedures have been included in the analysis. Another limitation pertains to the tested population of neurosurgeons. In fact, only one chief resident had gained enough experience with the system and no younger residents were included in the analysis. Furthermore, in this initial phase of implementation of the MxR system, any consideration about the improvement of the surgical planning after preoperative hologram's study is still subjective to the specific neurosurgeon using the technology. Before making objective conclusions, an analysis of more neurosurgical cases including the surgical outcomes will be necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Potential Improvements and Future Perspectives</title><p>The first and most relevant improvement for the tested MxR system would be the development of machine learning algorithms not only designed to recognize cerebral tumors, but also vascular pathologies and fine anatomic structures (ie, cranial nerves). As far as surgery rehearsal is concerned, the MxR system used did not provide the users with haptic feedback, nor did it allow the simulation of dural opening/closing or arachnoid dissection. These aspects should ideally be integrated to the system in the future.</p><p>The lack of more specific data gathered on the use of the hologram, for instance, the total time of use of the hologram in the OR, represents a sensible goal for a subsequent study to document the impact of MxR on the OR workflow and multidisciplinary team.</p><p>Future research should focus on improving the realism of the anatomic reconstruction of the system, empowering the users to rehearse all steps of the surgical procedures. With further technological development, one for all the integration of hemodynamic information, for instance, routine implementation of MxR will have indeed the potential to make a critical difference in all subfields of neurosurgery. Indeed, further attention should be given to automatic face hologram matching and to improve the performance of the system with nonoptimal internet connection.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>To our knowledge, this study analyzes the biggest single-center series of neurosurgical cases prepared with the use of 3D interactive holograms, documenting the impact of MxR's implementation in the neurosurgical routine. The perioperative use of 3D holograms improved direct anatomic visualization while not significantly increasing intraoperative surgical preparation time. Usability of the system was adequate. Further technological development is necessary to improve the automatic algorithms, reduce the hologram preparation time by circumventing manual and semiautomatic segmentation, make the holograms more realistic, and reduce even further the steps required to use the system. Future studies should focus on quantifying the benefits in teaching, training, and the impact on surgical and functional outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="presented-at"><p>A modified version of the Abstract of this study was presented at the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS) Congress in Barcelona on September 27th 2023 as an ePoster.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><italic toggle="yes">Operative Neurosurgery Speaks!</italic> Audio abstracts available for this article at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.operativeneurosurgery-online.com" ext-link-type="uri">operativeneurosurgery-online.com</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><sec sec-type="funding"><title>Funding</title><p content-type="funding">This work is part of &#x0201c;SURGENT&#x0201d; under the auspices of University Medicine Zurich/Hochschulmedizin Z&#x000fc;rich.</p></sec><sec sec-type="disclosure"><title>Disclosures</title><p content-type="disclosure">Tristan van Doormaal is cofounder and CMO of Augmedit bv, an AR company and received the EIC Accelerator Grant.

<year>2021</year>;<volume>51</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>e4</fpage>.</mixed-citation></ref></ref-list><sec><title>COMMENTS</title><p>This report by Colombo et al is a timely addition to the growing literature surrounding the implementation of augmented or mixed reality in the neurosurgical operating room. Frameless stereotaxy has revolutionized cranial surgery and has been universally adopted; augmented reality almost certainly represents the next generation of this technology. The primary hurdle to such implementation, aside from cost, is user familiarity and acceptance. Therefore, the report of this technology in over 100 cases, with no increase in preoperative planning times, should encourage readers that this technology can be seamlessly added to the workflow of a modern operating room.</p><p>Nonetheless, this case series illustrates how far augmented reality still must go to become clinically useful. In only 3 of 107 cases was the operative plan altered by the addition of this technology; 2 of these, aneurysm clippings, would be performed by most surgeons without the use of stereotactic guidance in the first place, while the third, a tectal-region mass, was altered from an infratentorial to a transtentorial approach. This is a significant change that would realistically require repositioning of the patient, and in our experience, such a change would need to be made preoperatively by detailed review of MRI imaging. We feel that an experienced surgeon planning such an approach is unlikely to be influenced by the low-resolution 3D reconstructions demonstrated in the accompanying figures, while, on the other hand, these images have not yet reached the level of precision and reliability to assist the inexperienced surgeon either. Therefore, these tools are currently most useful in teaching residents the crucial internal three-dimensional understanding of cranial anatomy that previously could only be gained from repetitive surgical experience. But as this report implicitly acknowledges, their usefulness ceases once incision is made.</p><p content-type="flushright">
