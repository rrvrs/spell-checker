However, quantifying &#x02018;midwifery regulatory environments&#x02019; as a construct across countries has been difficult, limiting our ability to evaluate relationships between regulatory environments and key outcomes and hindering actionable steps toward improvement. The Global Midwives&#x02019; Associations map survey includes data across five domains of regulation (overarching regulatory policy and legislation; education and qualification; licensure; registration/re-licensure; and scope and conduct of practice). We aimed to use these data to develop a composite index that represents the midwifery regulatory environment in the countries that participated in the survey.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">To develop our composite Midwifery Regulatory Environment (MRE) Index, we analyzed data from 115 countries in the Global Midwives&#x02019; Associations map survey. We identified five different possible scoring characterizations for thirteen regulatory items. Four characterizations used continuous or categorical cumulative scoring and one used multiple individual components scoring. We compared these characterizations using Clarke&#x02019;s test and descriptive model fit metrics to identify the best fit and performance for three outcomes: maternal mortality ratio, low birthweight prevalence, and stillbirth rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The Aggregated Domain Scoring method, which assigns one point for each of the five essential regulatory domains with activity (possible score range: 0&#x02013;5), was the best fit and performing characterization for maternal mortality ratio and stillbirth outcomes. The Any-or-None Scoring method, which assigns one point per survey item with regulatory activity (possible score range: 0&#x02013;13), best fit low birthweight prevalence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Our study demonstrates that developing composite characterizations of complex constructs, as exemplified by MRE Index development, can enhance the usability of existing global health datasets. Additionally, it highlights how employing model fit prediction provides a transparent, replicable, and accessible approach for identifying the optimal characterization of the construct based on a specific outcome. Specifically, we found that different characterizations for the MRE Index are preferred for different maternal health outcomes. The MRE Index we have developed stands as a valuable tool for future research exploring relationships between midwifery regulation and maternal health outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12913-025-12694-w.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Model selection</kwd><kwd>Model comparison</kwd><kwd>Midwifery</kwd><kwd>Regulation</kwd><kwd>Regulatory environment</kwd><kwd>Secondary data analysis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par19">The 2014 Lancet Series on Midwifery provided a comprehensive review of the role and potential contributions of midwives, strengthening the evidence for the broader use of midwives as an essential and cost-efficient strategy for improving maternal health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Modeling studies indicate that universal coverage of a set of life-saving high-impact interventions, including family planning, preconception, antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care, that can be delivered by midwives could prevent 67% of all maternal deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the midwifery workforce faces numerous obstacles in many countries, hindering their capacity to achieve this end. These barriers include unclear roles, inconsistent or limited scopes of practice, absent or limited continuing professional development programs, varying educational and clinical standards for entry to practice, and weak licensure and registration authorities and systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Strengthening midwifery regulation has been proposed by policymakers as a means of overcoming existing barriers and improving maternal health care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Healthcare professional regulation establishes mechanisms and standards that define the roles of different healthcare professional groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Midwifery regulation, specifically, refers to the legislation and resultant criteria and procedures that determine the qualifications of midwives, delineate their scope of practice, and differentiate them from non-midwives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Regulation is intended to support midwives to work autonomously within their full scope of practice to assure standards of maternity care and maternal and newborn health outcomes, and is a priority component of addressing health workforce challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There are five major domains of midwifery regulation: overarching regulatory policy and legislation, education and qualification, licensure, registration/re-licensure, and scope and conduct of practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A strong midwifery regulatory environment is one wherein the profession is recognized to be a distinct profession under legislation, having its own regulatory body or track within a broader regulatory body. This regulatory body must have statutory authority and be capable of implementing and overseeing activities across the major domains of regulation (1) to ensure prescribed educational standards are met by all midwives; (2) to establish and maintain transparent standards and processes for entering and remaining in practice; (3) to ensure the defined midwifery scope of practice aligns with the International Confederation of Midwives&#x02019; (ICM) definition of a midwife; and, (4) to establish transparent procedures for addressing complaints and to administer discipline, as needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A weak regulatory environment is one where most or all of these structures, mechanisms, and/or activities are absent, curtailed, or non-functional.</p><p id="Par21">Despite delineation of the components and functions of midwifery regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], few attempts have been made to measure and quantify regulatory environments in a consistent way across countries. Additionally, there is a lack of research regarding the influence of regulatory environments on maternal health outcomes that limits actionability toward ICM and the World Health Organization (WHO) calls for improved midwifery regulation. This underscores the importance for additional research to inform and justify investments in transformative regulatory initiatives, particularly research that establishes a clear link between regulatory efforts and measurable outcomes.</p><p id="Par22">The Global Midwives&#x02019; Associations map survey is a high-quality dataset available to the public, containing information on midwifery associations, education, leadership, and regulation across more than a hundred countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This is a crucial resource for research on global midwifery regulation. When paired with other aggregated databases such as the Global Health Data Exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and WHO Global Health Observatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], datasets like the Global Midwives&#x02019; Association map survey enable research teams to cost-effectively explore new questions using existing, high-quality data from diverse national and global sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Analyzing secondary data is a widely recognized method for developing evidence required in global health initiatives, policymaking, and investments. For example, use of Demographic Health Survey data was instrumental in recommending future funding allocation for marginalized groups in Nigeria to achieve universal maternal health coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Similarly, examining maternal death audit data has helped identify obstacles to implementing postpartum hemorrhage recommendations in Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Maximizing the usefulness of existing datasets frequently requires aggregating two or more variables that represent multiple dimensions of a particular domain or construct into a unified composite measure in order to effectively capture complex health system and service delivery contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This can increase reliability by decreasing reliance on a single indicator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, given the potential impact on policy and programming decision-making, researchers must be conscientious in defining and operationalizing health system components to prevent oversimplification or misrepresentation in composite scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Given this, a prerequisite step before using data from the Global Midwives&#x02019; Associations map survey to evaluate the relationship between midwifery regulatory environments and maternal health outcomes is to aggregate responses from regulatory-focused survey questions into a composite regulatory measure that encompasses the five regulatory domains. Our primary aim with this study is to use responses from the Global Midwives&#x02019; Associations map survey to develop a composite index that represents the midwifery regulatory environment in the countries that participated in the survey.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par24">We conducted secondary data analysis on the multi-country Global Midwives&#x02019; Associations map survey dataset, which includes questions associated with the regulatory aspects of midwifery. The ICM, in charge of administering the survey, derived the regulatory section from their Global Standards for Midwives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which were established through expert consensus by a multi-member ICM-appointed taskforce with input from regulators and ICM member associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We identified five different characterizations of scoring regulatory indicators to create a composite score we called the &#x02018;Midwifery Regulatory Environment (MRE) Index&#x02019;. We assessed model fit and performance in prediction of outcomes for each of the five characterizations to determine the most appropriate characterization for use in evaluating relationships between the MRE Index and maternal health outcomes in future research. This study was approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Conceptual framework</title><p id="Par25">Before analysis, we developed a conceptual framework depicting the essential MRE domains from the ICM Global Standards for Regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] (i.e., <italic>overarching regulatory policy and legislation</italic>; <italic>education and qualification</italic>; <italic>licensure</italic>; <italic>registration/re-licensure</italic>; and <italic>scope and conduct of practice</italic>) and their key components as described by several research teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Countries with no ICM member association were invited to participate through UNFPA and WHO regional offices. The survey included four sub-surveys: association, education, leadership data, and regulation and was available in English, Russian, Spanish, and French. Respondents were country midwifery associations, with support from the UNFPA Country Office and relevant government authorities/organization, and data validation was conducted by an analysis team contracted by ICM and country government officials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. One hundred-fifteen member countries submitted responses to the regulatory subsection.</p><p id="Par27">For our dependent variables, we used publicly available data from the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group for a country&#x02019;s MMR, defined as the number of female deaths from any cause related to pregnancy or its management, excluding accidental causes, per 100,000 live births in a given year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The United Nations Children&#x02019;s Fund (UNICEF)-WHO 2019 low birthweight (LBW) database provided data for the LBW prevalence outcome, defined as the percentage of newborns at birth that weight less than 2,500 g regardless of gestational age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We used United Nations Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation Core Stillbirth Estimation Group for the stillbirth outcome, defined as the number of babies born without signs of life at or after 28 weeks of gestation, per 1,000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Each dependent variable was treated as continuous, and transformations were undertaken when necessary. We incorporated the same set of four covariates in all models to adjust for economic and socioeconomic variations between countries. We obtained covariate data for our modeling from several publicly available datasets, including the United Nation Development Program&#x02019;s (UNDP) Human Development Index (HDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and WHO&#x02019;s Global Health Expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] databases, as well as the World Bank&#x02019;s Gini Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and income group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] databases. Two of these covariates (country health spending in US dollars and the Gini Index, which measures the extent to which the distribution of income or consumption among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution on a scale of 0 [perfect equity]&#x02212; 1 [perfect inequality] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]) were continuous variables. The other two covariates were categorical with four categories each. HDI is a composite measure of average achievement in three key dimensions of human life: a long and healthy life measured by life expectancy at birth; education, measured by mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling; and a decent standard of living, measured by gross national income per capita in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) international dollars. HDI is reported on a scale from 0 to 1.00 and categorized by UNDP as Low (HDI &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.550), Medium (HDI between 0.550 and 0.699), High (HDI between 0.700 and 0.799) and Very High (HDI &#x02265;&#x02009;0.800) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A country&#x02019;s income group is assigned annually by the World Bank based on the gross national income (GNI) per capita of the previous year, expressed in United States dollars. In 2022, countries were classified as low income (GNI per capita less than $1,085), lower-middle income (GNI per capita $1,086&#x02013;4,255), upper-middle income (GNI per capita $4,256&#x02013;13,205), and high income (GNI per capita greater than $13,205).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Alignment of data with conceptual framework</title><p id="Par28">The regulatory subsection of the Global Midwives&#x02019; Associations map survey consists of 38 questions identified by ICM and the State of the World&#x02019;s Midwifery Core Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We began by selecting questions appropriate for inclusion as items in the MRE Index. Of the 38 regulatory subsection questions, eight were excluded because they were open-ended and asked for free-text information (e.g., the source of or link to data provided in another question), and another eight were excluded as they did not directly relate to at least one regulatory domain (e.g., number of non-practicing midwives). We consolidated five questions on individual components of family planning scope of practice into one family planning scope of practice item. Likewise, we consolidated seven questions on individual components of basic emergency obstetric and newborn care (BEmONC) into a specific BEmONC scope of practice item. Nine of the original regulatory subsection questions were included without change and a final question about the frequency of re-licensure (question RS17) was included after answer free-text options were re-coded into a yes/no format (i.e., &#x0201c;Never&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; coded as no, all other numeric answers coded as yes).

We performed several inverse square root transformations and selected the ones that most effectively reduced skewness and kurtosis. We used the open-source statistical platform R for data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>MRE index scoring characterizations</title><p id="Par31">Developing different scoring characterizations for the MRE Index involved ensuring that very weak or very strong performance on specific elements of the regulatory environment was not masked and deciding how to group and weight the final set of 13 items contributing to the MRE Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Additionally, we needed to determine whether to use a cumulative or multiple individual components model.

This addresses how increasing the total number of regulatory activities in a country impacts outcomes, regardless of their specific activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This characterization suggests that rather than specific items or domains, it is an accumulation of events that drives outcomes.

We then assessed the fit and performance of each characterization to identify the optimal characterization of the effects of the regulatory environment on three maternal health-related outcomes (MMR, LBW prevalence rate, and stillbirth rate) in order to have an operationalized independent variable (the MRE Index) representing the midwifery regulatory environment construct for future research.</p><p id="Par41">The MRE Index represents a significant step towards better characterization of a construct that represents the complexity of a multicomponent midwifery regulatory environment. The high predictive power of the models we tested indicates that the regulatory environment plays a critical role in maternal health outcomes. This research provides a replicable and transparent methodological process for operationalizing and measuring the MRE. Future research can build on this work by exploring areas such as the impact of the MRE on midwifery recruitment and retention. Overall, this research underscores the importance of midwifery regulation, highlighting its significance for policymakers and encouraging investment in this area.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Research implications</title><p id="Par42">Our study highlights that a commonly used method among researchers when developing scoring systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] &#x02013; simply adding up answers to all questions &#x02013; can yield some of the poorest results. This was evident in our Total Sum model, where each question contributed equally to an additive score without considering the number of questions in each regulatory domain. Consequently, our Total Sum model disproportionately weighted the scope of practice questions because they had more components rather than considering their inherent significance. While the impact of this weighting was somewhat masked by the small number of items in our survey, on a larger scale, a Total Sum model could significantly inflate scores from multicomponent questions lacking a conceptual basis. An inaccurate, oversimplified, or suboptimal characterization of a predictor variable has significant implications given the reliance on evidence-based research for policy and programmatic decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Incorporating model fit and prediction as standard practice in composite variable development could enhance the reliability and replicability of conclusions derived from research that uses a composite variable predictor.</p><p id="Par43">Expert consensus, often achieved through methods like the Delphi process or modified Delphi process, is a common approach used in developing composite measures. For example, Vedam et al. used a four-round modified Delphi process to identify, rank, and weight items to create a Midwifery Integration Scoring System for assessing midwifery integration in the United States, using regulatory data from multiple databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. While this process is widely used, it has limitations: it can be time-consuming and lack reliability, the definition of &#x0201c;consensus&#x0201d; may be ambiguous, and maintaining ongoing expert engagement can be challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Importantly, reaching consensus does not guarantee the &#x02018;correct&#x02019; answer has been found; it simply indicates agreement on the importance of certain aspects related to the topic being studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In an era prioritizing decolonization of global health research, alternative approaches are valuable, especially considering that researchers in LMICs may not have access to a global body of experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The &#x02018;model fit and prediction&#x02019; approach we present offers an excellent alternative for developing a composite variable in many scenarios.</p><p id="Par44">Developing composite measures increases the value of secondary data analysis by effectively and efficiently operationalizing complex health system data. This approach is versatile, cost-effective, and applicable across various outcomes. However, researchers must remain mindful that the methodology used to develop final composite measures may significantly affect research findings in terms of reliability, validity, and usefulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Therefore, transparent and replicable approaches are essential, along with justification of the methods used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Our study demonstrates how this methodology can be used to create a composite variable for subsequent use in studies with significant global health implications and offers a framework for other researchers to undertake similar processes. When regulatory data is not available for a health profession, these findings demonstrate the value of routine regulatory data collection and how this data can be used to strengthen regulatory efforts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Scoring characterizations and outcomes</title><p id="Par45">Our results also indicate that different scoring characterizations may be preferred for different outcomes, a finding that has important implications for interpreting relationships between midwifery regulatory environment and outcomes. The Aggregated Domain model (which assigns a single point for at least one category in which action is being taken in each domain) was the best fit for both MMR and stillbirth rate. This suggests that no single domain is more important than another and that even limited activities within a domain can significantly strengthen the regulatory environment. The Aggregated Domain model is relatively straightforward to understand and calculate, aiding replicability and preventing inadvertent weighting of certain domains due to some domains having more questions than others. Overall, this model suggests that countries making efforts to address regulation across all domains may achieve better outcomes than those focusing more heavily on one area while neglecting others. Additional research is needed to confirm how this finding is reflected in practice across different countries.</p><p id="Par46">The best model fit and performance for the LBW prevalence outcome was the Any-or-None model. This may be because prevalence of low birth weight is, in many ways, a more complex and multifactorial phenomenon than stillbirth rate and MMR. While intrapartum stillbirths, which account for approximately half of all stillbirths globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and as much as 75% of stillbirths in some countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and MMR are heavily dependent on care provided during the intrapartum period, birthweight is already determined by the time a patient presents for intrapartum care, except in cases of premature labor where skilled care can sometimes delay birth. LBW is multi-factorial with contributing factors including maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy, antenatal care attendance, acute (e.g., malaria, syphilis) and chronic maternal health conditions (e.g., hypertension), and lifestyle choices (e.g., smoking) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Thus, while LBW prevalence is a sensitive indicator of maternal health care quality, it indicates the quality of care across the reproductive lifespan, and the variation in the best fit model may reflect this. Comparing model fit and performance between fresh stillbirth (no sign of maceration) outcomes, which are more likely related to intrapartum care, and macerated stillbirth outcomes, which are more likely to have multifactorial antepartum causes similar to LBW, might provide additional insights into why one midwifery regulatory environment model works better for intrapartum-focused outcomes and another for antepartum or reproductive lifespan outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par47">This study was intended to compare different characterizations of the MRE predictor variable&#x02014;not the effects of regulatory environment on outcomes&#x02014;and so we do not report here the specific individual effect estimates of the MRE on outcomes. In order to compare models using Clarke&#x02019;s test, all models included the same covariates, regardless of collinearity with the composite measure or each other. This ensured that differences between models were due to differences in characterization of the MRE Index, because variation from the covariates remains constant across models. These decisions do affect model outcomes and how models should be interpreted. Additionally, we did not use a multi-level modeling approach in this study because of data limitations, and so we are not able to detect differences in the correlates of MMR that may differ by country. Additional research on this topic would be a valuable contribution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par48">Midwifery regulation is widely acknowledged as crucial for effective midwifery care, which significantly impacts maternal health outcomes. Our study demonstrates that using model fit prediction with existing datasets offers a transparent and accessible approach for developing a Midwifery Regulatory Environment (MRE) Index with strong predictive power for key maternal health outcomes (MMR, LBW prevalence, and stillbirth rate). The MRE Index can be a valuable tool for researchers investigating relationships between regulatory environments, midwifery-related factors, and health outcomes. The broader takeaway from this study is that global health researchers should consider integrating model fit prediction in developing composite measures during secondary data analysis. This can enhance the transparency, replicability, and accuracy of their findings, providing valuable insights for policymakers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
