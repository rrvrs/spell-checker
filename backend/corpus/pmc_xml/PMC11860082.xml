Their high consumer demand and market value contribute to substantial profitability for producers. In recent years, due to increasing costs of production and occurrence of extreme weather events, the use of controlled environment agriculture (CEA) and hydroponics for strawberry production has become popular in several Asian, European, and American countries. There are two main types of hydroponic systems: substrate- and water-culture. Substrate-culture systems are the common choice for CEA strawberry production, whereas water-culture systems are usually used for crops like leafy greens and herbs. Both systems have been independently studied for CEA strawberry production, but direct comparisons between them are still limited. The objective of this study was to compare the performance of substrate and water-culture systems for CEA strawberry production regarding yield and resource use efficiencies. &#x02018;Florida Brilliance&#x02019; and &#x02018;Florida Beauty&#x02019; strawberries were grown in a greenhouse in one substrate-culture, with plants grow in soilless media, and three water-culture systems: nutrient film technique (NFT), vertical tower (stacked nutrient flow), and aeroponics (nutrient misted roots). The system inputs (water, energy, and area) and outputs (yield, biomass, etc.) were quantified during the 129-day experiment. Fruit yield was used to calculate water (WUE), energy (EUE), and area (AUE) use efficiencies. Based on yield and resource use efficiencies, the substrate system performed the best, with the vertical tower system also showing promising performance. The results of this experiment can help growers understand the tradeoffs between hydroponic systems to maximize both profits and sustainability for CEA strawberry production.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>

China was the largest producer in 2022, with a harvest of 3.35 million metric tons, while the United States was the second largest producer, with a harvest of 1.26 million metric tons (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">USDA, 2022</xref>). In the United States, California (90.6%) and Florida (9.4%) comprise nearly all domestic strawberry production (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">USDA, 2022</xref>). Production from these two states in 2021 was valued at $3.42 billion, a 31% increase compared to the previous year. This increase is due to the rising cost of inputs (fertilizer, equipment, and labor), increased consumer demand, and reduced yields due to abnormal weather (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">USDA, 2022</xref>). Irregular weather is projected to become more frequent and extreme in the coming decades as the effects of climate change continue to develop (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bolster et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Most domestic strawberries are grown using the annual hill plasticulture system. While popular and effective, this system relies heavily on soil fumigants to minimize disease pressure and preserve yields. This reliance on pesticides, increasing input costs, and the effects of climate change have led to rising interest in controlled environment production of strawberries in recent years (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Samtani et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Controlled environment production, also known as controlled environment agriculture (CEA), aids in insulating crops from the adverse effects of climate change, decreases the need for pesticides, and increases the growing season length for areas without ideal climates. CEA accomplishes these feats by leveraging technology and engineering to optimize the crop&#x02019;s growing environment. Soilless hydroponic growing systems can further minimize pesticide use while minimizing the use of other inputs like water and fertilizer (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000f3;mez et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Wrenn et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>CEA strawberry production in the form of low-tunnels, high-tunnels, and climate-controlled greenhouses has been established commercially outside of the United States for many years. South Korea, Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy have produced strawberries commercially in controlled environments for decades (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ahn et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Neri et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida, 2013</xref>). This controlled environment strawberry industry is also making its way into North America&#x02019;s greenhouses. A Dutch company recently completed a 29-hectare greenhouse facility for commercial controlled environment strawberry production in Ontario, Canada, the largest such facility on the continent (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hemmes, 2021</xref>). Recent advancements in CEA are allowing strawberry farms to be installed indoors in specialized vertical systems where the crops are grown with tightly controlled environmental parameters and sole-source artificial lighting. Since these indoor systems are not reliant on outdoor weather or climate conditions, they can be implemented anywhere. This capability enables food production to be brought closer to consumers, thereby reducing transportation distances and further decoupling our food production infrastructure from the uncertainties of an increasingly unstable environment.</p><p>These CEA systems are attractive to many North American growers, with the most popular crops currently being leafy greens, microgreens, and herbs (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Van Gerrewey et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>), and most recently growing interest in strawberries. For example, in 2022, a large CEA company announced a partnership with a global leader in the strawberry market to build what will purportedly be the largest indoor vertical farm complex in the world, which will produce millions of kilograms of strawberries annually (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Green, 2023</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Oller, 2022</xref>). The complex will be located in Virginia &#x02013; a state with minimal commercial strawberry production where 79% of growers operate on 5 acres or fewer (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Christman and Samtani, 2019</xref>). The state&#x02019;s strawberry industry could soon see extreme growth thanks to the CEA industry. In addition to the economic impact of this technology, the wider distribution of commercial strawberry production will aid in mitigating the negative effects of extreme weather events and preserve the availability of a valuable, high-demand fruit crop for consumers.</p><p>Since greenhouses and vertical farms are more energy-intensive than traditional field production, growers must understand how to minimize their input costs to maximize their business&#x02019;s profitability. There are many types of hydroponic growing systems that are commonly used in CEA, and these systems can heavily influence growers&#x02019; input costs. Hydroponic systems can broadly be divided into two groups: substrate- and water-culture systems. Substrate-culture systems provide a soilless material, usually peat, coco coir, perlite, or some mix thereof, into which the roots can grow. The substrate can then be irrigated and/or fertilized by drip, ebb-and-flow subirrigation, or other methods. In water culture systems, there is no solid substrate, and the roots primarily interact with an aqueous fertilizer solution. This solution can be in constant contact with the roots (statically or dynamically), or the roots can be intermittently exposed to the solution via flowing or spraying/misting.</p><p>These two groups of hydroponic systems have been separately studied in several experiments for CEA strawberry production. Within substrate-culture systems, substrate compositions and fertigation solution formulations have been popular avenues of investigation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cantliffe et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Ebrahimi et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Linardakis and Manios, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">McKean, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Takeda, 1999</xref>). In water culture systems, solution temperatures, individual nutrient elemental concentrations, and electrical conductivity (EC) levels have all proven to be common topics (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Akon et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Caruso et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chow et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Economakois and Krulji, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Eissa et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Masaru et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). There have only been a few studies that have generally compared the performance of different hydroponic systems concerning yield (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mohamed et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Richardson et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>), and very few have compared the performance of soil or substrate-culture systems with water culture systems (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Albaho et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Treftz and Omaye, 2015</xref>).</p><p>This experiment&#x02019;s main goal was to compare the yield (total and marketable) of strawberry plants grown in substrate- and water-culture hydroponic systems in a greenhouse. Another objective was to quantify the inputs to the growing systems (water, energy, and footprint area) over the growth cycle and calculate resource use efficiencies for each input concerning the system output, i.e., yield. The final goal of the study was to outline the tradeoffs between systems in terms of inputs and outputs so that growers can make informed decisions in this increasingly popular CEA strawberry market. We hypothesized that varying production systems would induce distinct physiological and morphological responses in the two tested cultivars, potentially leading to improved yield and more efficient resource utilization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Location and environmental conditions</title><p>This experiment was conducted at the University of Georgia (College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Department of Horticulture, Controlled Environment Agriculture Crop Physiology and Production lab) in Athens, Georgia, USA (latitude 33&#x000b0;55&#x02019;55.10&#x0201d; N, longitude 83&#x000b0;21&#x02019;50.51&#x0201d; W, altitude 198 m) from December 2022 to April 2023 in a 9.14 &#x000d7; 21.95 m polycarbonate greenhouse with controlled conditions.</p><p>Greenhouse air temperature and relative humidity were monitored using a digital sensor (HMP60; Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland) connected to a datalogger (CR1000X; Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, United States) for automatic data collection.

The gutter drained into a 121 L plastic reservoir (H-3687; Uline, Pleasant Prairie, WI, United States) for recirculation. Four plants of each cultivar were placed in every trough in two contiguous lines of four. The soilless media or substrate was a 1:1 (volume:volume) mixture of super coarse perlite (Horticultural Perlite; Whittemore Co., Lawrence, MA, United States) and a peat-based commercial mix (Metro-Mix 830; Sun Gro Horticulture, Agawam, MA, United States). This product had 40-50% Canadian Sphagnum peat moss, 20-30% composted pine bark, 10-20% parboiled rice hulls, 5-10% horticultural grade vermiculite, starter nutrient charge with gypsum and slow release nitrogen (N) and wetting agent (non-organic). The substrate final substrate composition was 50% perlite, 25% peat, 15% pine bark, 7% rice hulls, and 3% vermiculite, as recommended by the Kubota Laboratory (<ext-link xlink:href="https://u.osu.edu/indoorberry/substrates" ext-link-type="uri">https://u.osu.edu/indoorberry/substrates</ext-link>).

Eight holes were drilled in each channel for 7 cm net cups (HG3.75; Hydrofarm, Shoemakersville, PA, United States). Four plants of each cultivar were placed in each channel in an alternating pattern. A bulkhead fitting (Banjo TF-050; Alsco Industrial Products, Atlanta, GA, United States) on the down-slope side of the channel was used to enable constant recirculation, and a small length of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe (4 cm) was fitted to the inner side of the bulkhead to maintain a continuous level of solution in the channel so that the bottoms of the net cups were always in contact with the solution. Four channels were built for 32 plants in the NFT system, and the central four plants in each were considered measurement plants.

This tower was made of nine 18-cm tall layers, each with four plant sites around its circumference. An inner, central column connected to the reservoir pump on the bottom reached above the top layer to the stop cap. As the pump activated, nutrient solution was sent up this column, hit the stop cap, and then percolated down through every layer into the reservoir via gravity. The area between the inner central column and the outer wall, where the plant sites were, was hollow, which allowed roots to interact with the nutrient solution as it percolated. There were also holes just below the stop cap and at every layer that aided with even distribution as the solution percolated down. The system consisted of two of these towers (one per cultivar) for a total of 72 plants, and the plants in the middle two layers of each tower were considered measurement plants.

This change was instituted to accommodate the larger fruit production as the season progressed and to minimize fruit losses due to fungal pathogens. Fruit that were 70% or more ripe were harvested from each measurement plant. Fruit from each plant were counted and collectively weighed using a digital scale (Item #30430061; Ohaus Corporation, Parsippany, NJ, United States) to measure the fresh fruit yield. Marketable fruit were also counted and collectively weighed to obtain the marketable yield. A fruit was considered marketable if it weighed 8 g and was evenly pollinated. The largest marketable fruit (or simply the largest fruit if none were marketable) was cut longitudinally in half. One of the halves was weighed and then crushed using cheesecloth and a garlic press to measure total soluble solids (TSS) using a digital refractometer (Model #HI96801; Hanna Instruments, Smithfield, RI, United States). The other half, along with the remaining fruit from the plant, were placed in an 80&#x000b0;C oven for several days until completely dehydrated. The dehydrated fruit were weighed again to obtain the fruit dry biomass. By weighing the half-fruit used for TSS analysis, the total fruit biomass before and after dehydration was known, and thus, fruit water content could be calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s2_7"><label>2.7</label><title>Plant harvest measurements</title><p>The strawberry plants were terminated on April 27, 2023 (129 days after transplanting). Before harvesting, the plant height was measured using a meter stick, and weighed by cutting the crown at the soil line, and weighed using a digital scale (#PB3002; Mettler Toledo, Griefensee, Switzerland) to determine fresh shoot biomass. The number of flowers, fruit, runners, and leaves was counted for each plant. Plant mortality was also assessed at this stage by direct counting. The harvest index was then calculated using the total fruit yield and the fresh shoot biomass: total fruit fresh weight &#x000f7; (total fruit fresh weight + plant fresh weight). Next, all healthy trifoliate leaves for each plant were scanned using a leaf area meter (LI-3100; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) to obtain the total leaf area. Each plant was placed into its own paper bag and an 80&#x000b0;C oven for several days until completely dried. Dry shoot biomass was then measured using the same digital scale. Finally, dried trifoliate leaves were placed in sample bags and sent to a commercial lab (Waters Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, GA, United States) for tissue nutrient concentration analysis.</p><p>Leaf N was determined by high temperature combustion process (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Nelson and Sommers, 1973</xref>).

All reservoirs were filled to a known volume at the start of the experiment and filled again to that known volume after draining and refilling. Residual reservoir volume was measured during drain and refill events, which were triggered when reservoir volume was low and/or when the reservoir pH and EC were extremely out of the ideal ranges (5.5-6.5 for pH and 0.75-1.25 for EC). By knowing reservoir volume before and after refills, total system losses from evapotranspiration (ET) were easily calculated by simple subtraction.</p><p>To calculate water use efficiency (WUE), ET per plant was first calculated by dividing reservoir ET by the number of plants supplied by that reservoir. Yield per plant was then divided by this ET per plant (based on from which system the fruit was harvested) to obtain plant WUE in grams per liter.</p><p>Total system energy use was calculated by tracking the total pump activation time in hours for each system. The NFT recirculating pump ran continuously, the leaching events in the substrate system were timed manually, and the vertical and aeroponic pumps ran on the 5-minute on and 45-minute off cycle throughout the experiment. Power consumption in Watts of all pumps was determined based on manufacturer specifications (36 W for NFT and substrate, 48 W for vertical and aeroponic). The total pump run times and power consumption rates were multiplied to obtain total system energy use in kilowatt hours (kWh).</p><p>To calculate energy use efficiency (EUE), energy use per plant was first calculated by dividing the total system energy use by the number of plants in that system. Yield per plant was then divided by this energy use per plant to obtain plant EUE in grams per kWh.</p><p>The system footprint area was calculated by measuring the widest system dimensions with a tape measure and calculating the footprint area appropriately (the substrate, NFT, and aeroponic systems&#x02019; footprint areas are rectangular, and the vertical systems are circular). One substrate trough (8 plants total), one single NFT channel (8 plants), one vertical tower (36 plants), and one aeroponic tub (32 plants) were measured for these calculations.</p><p>System area use efficiency (AUE) or the maximum yield per area that a particular system can deliver was calculated by multiplying yield per plant by the number of plants per measured system (or system component as outlined in the previous paragraph) and then dividing that resulting number by the system footprint area. Note that the AUE calculation does not consider the spacing between systems needed to implement these systems at scale effectively but instead represents an ideal maximum AUE.</p></sec><sec id="s2_9"><label>2.9</label><title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title><p>We tested four different hydroponic systems as the main factor: one substrate-culture system (substrate) as the control and three water culture systems NFT, vertical, and aeroponic).

The substrate and the NFT system had 32 plants each, the vertical system 72, and the aeroponics system 64.

It is not likely that this difference arose due to the substrate system providing greater access to root zone oxygen; both the vertical and aeroponic systems allowed plant roots to be exposed to the ambient atmosphere for 45 out of every 50 minutes during the experiment. Since the harvest index results were not extraordinarily affected by the systems (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">

</xref>). Larger plants with greater leaf areas can absorb more light and produce more photosynthates. Since fruit is a carbohydrate sink organ in the plant, greater availability of carbohydrates from photosynthesis should lead to more and larger fruit development. This positive correlation between the vegetative biomass and yield has also been reported previously in aeroponic, substrate, and soil strawberry production systems (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Akon et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Madhavi et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). The most likely explanation for this increase in overall biomass in the substrate system is that those plants were less stressed than plants in the water culture systems. We observed that both cultivars had the highest shoot water content in the substrate system (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figures&#x000a0;5E, F</bold>
</xref>). Leaf growth is driven by cell water uptake and storage to increase turgor pressure and expand cell walls (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Boyer, 1988</xref>). As leaves become more fully developed and expanded, mesophyll cells contain more water, and thus shoot water content increases. Reductions in shoot water content due to stress factors such as heat and drought have been previously correlated with reductions in biomass and yield for barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>), bell pepper (<italic>Capsicum annum</italic>), maize (<italic>Zea mays sinensis</italic> &#x02018;Kulesh&#x02019;), and snap bean (<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Behbahanizadeh et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ferrara et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). We observed the same correlation in both strawberry cultivars, indicating that the plants in the water culture systems were likely experiencing an increase in osmotic stress that led to reduced biomass accumulation.</p><p>A possible contributing factor to the increased biomass production in the substrate system could be the greater mechanical stability provided by the system. Although root biomass was not measured in this study, roots grown into substrate should theoretically afford greater mechanical stability than roots grown into a liquid solution. This increased mechanical stability could allow plants to grow taller and produce more vegetative biomass. Another possible contributing factor for the greater growth and yield in the substrate system is the increase in iron uptake in the substrate system because of the substrate cation exchange capacity. Iron is vital to the electron transport process during photosynthesis due to its inclusion in photosystem II, cytochrome <italic>b6f</italic>, photosystem I, and ferredoxin. Without enough iron available within leaf mesophyll cells, the entire photosynthetic machinery and downstream biological processes would be slowed (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Briat et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Taiz and Zeiger, 2010</xref>). We observed much greater iron foliar concentrations for both cultivars in the substrate system compared to the other three systems, with the substrate system measuring over 500 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> of iron and the water culture systems all measuring between 90 and 150 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">
<bold>Tables&#x000a0;1</bold>
</xref>, <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">
<bold>2</bold>
</xref>). However, the range of 90 to 150 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> foliar iron is not necessarily deficient. No symptoms of iron deficiency, such as interveinal chlorosis, were observed during the study, indicating that chlorophyll biosynthesis was not inhibited at those concentrations. This observation agrees with previous research that has listed sufficiency ranges for strawberry foliar iron as 50-3000, 50-100, 50-300, and 102-188 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bottoms et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Our observed values of foliar iron in the substrate system exceeded three out of four of these ranges. It could be possible that the foliar iron concentrations in the water culture systems were sufficient to prevent chlorosis from developing but resulted in a slow electron transfer process. Biochemical analyses would be needed to investigate this response further.</p><p>The treatments also affected fruit quality, though less than the total yield. Marketable yield followed a similar pattern in both cultivars to total yield: the substrate system had the greatest marketable yield, with the vertical and aeroponic systems next and the NFT system last. However, marketable yield was low in all systems, with no system yielding more than an average of 60 g per plant. This was primarily due to a potential lack of thorough pollination inside the greenhouse. Thorough pollination of strawberry flowers is essential for fruit to develop a symmetric, marketable shape. Strawberry flowers can self-pollinate, but biotic pollinators have been shown to improve pollination and produce larger, more evenly shaped fruit (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gudowska et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). We could not use biotic pollinators for this study and relied on active (deliberate with hands and blowers) and passive (from ambient air circulation) mechanical pollination. This likely led to reduced marketable yields.</p><p>The measurement of TSS by refractometry is a well-established approximation of the sugar concentration of strawberry fruit (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Madhavi et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). Only the cultivar Florida Brilliance produced fruit with significantly different TSS in the hydroponic systems, with the substrate system producing the lowest average TSS (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figures&#x000a0;3A, B</bold>
</xref>). This low TSS from the substrate system for &#x02018;Florida Brilliance&#x02019; matches the TSS values reported by a previous study for field trials of the same cultivar from February 2016 through March 2018, which ranged from 5.73-8.46% (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Whitaker et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). TSS values from the three water culture systems from this cultivar all exceeded this range. These results match those from a previous study that reported increases in strawberry fruit TSS when plants were subjected to drought stress (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yenni et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>). &#x02018;Florida Brilliance&#x02019; fruit from the substrate system also had significantly higher fruit water content than the three water culture systems; this increase in fruit water content alone could account for the decrease in TSS in fruit from the substrate system.</p><p>WUE was significantly affected by the treatments only for the cultivar Florida Brilliance, with the substrate system having the highest WUE (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figures&#x000a0;6A, B</bold>
</xref>). This is an unexpected result because it has been shown that for other commonly grown hydroponic crops, such as lettuce (<italic>Lactuca sativa</italic>), water culture systems have previously resulted in greater WUE than substrate systems (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Majid et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). This higher WUE in the substrate system is driven primarily by its larger yield. The average ET per plant in the substrate system was 17.21 L; in the NFT system, it was 4.70 L; in the aeroponic system, it was 8.10 L; and in the vertical system, it was 12.48 L. The substrate system resulted in the largest ET per plant due to higher evaporation and transpiration than the water culture systems. There was higher evaporation in the substrate system because as a substrate is irrigated, some of the water will evaporate before the plant can take it up. The higher transpiration resulted from those plants having higher leaf areas and, thus, more stomata for transpiration. Even though the substrate system had the highest ET per plant, the yield from the substrate system was large enough to compensate for this higher ET and result in the largest WUE.</p><p>The substrate system also had the highest EUE, which is expected (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figures&#x000a0;6C, D</bold>
</xref>). In water culture systems, a pump must run for plants to access water and nutrients. In a substrate system, the substrate retains water and nutrients provided during fertigation events that plants can then uptake over time. The average energy consumption per plant was 3.483 kWh in the NFT system, 0.413 kWh in the vertical system, 0.232 kWh in the aeroponic system, and 0.048 kWh in the substrate system. The energy consumption was so high in the NFT system due to the pump running continuously. Both the vertical and aeroponic systems ran for 5 minutes out of every 50 minutes, which is 10% of the time, and hence why the energy consumption from these two systems is approximately one order of magnitude less than the NFT system energy consumption. The substrate system had the lowest energy consumption with a total pump run time of 42.65 hours out of the 3096-hour (129-day) long experiment. These order-of-magnitude differences in energy consumption per plant are the primary drivers behind the differences in EUE among the systems.</p><p>The AUE analysis produced perhaps the most interesting results and demonstrated that water culture systems, specifically the vertical system, may have some relevant applications. The vertical system had an AUE extremely close to the substrate system AUE for the cultivar Florida Brilliance, whereas for &#x02018;Florida Beauty&#x02019;, the vertical system AUE was larger than the substrate system AUE (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figures&#x000a0;6E, F</bold>
</xref>). These AUE values are primarily driven by the vertical system&#x02019;s ability to maximize planting density. The vertical system had 64.3 plants per meter, the substrate system 27.4 plants per meter, the NFT system 25.8 plants per meter, and the aeroponic system 15.3 plants per meter. The vertical and substrate systems for both cultivars had AUE values between 3 and 6.5 kilograms per square meter (kg&#x000b7;m<sup>-2</sup>), which match with the results from a previous study that reported yields of 3.1, 5.5, and 6.5 kg&#x000b7;m<sup>-2</sup> for the strawberry cultivar Albion grown in a greenhouse substrate hydroponic system during three different seasons in both Arizona and Ohio (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">McKean, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>The substrate system produced the highest yields on a per-plant basis. The substrate system also utilized water and energy most efficiently to produce these high yields, and the substrate and vertical systems had high-efficiency use of the growing area. Our results show that the substrate system is the optimal growing system for hydroponic strawberries in greenhouses. It is possible through further research and refinement that water culture systems could be commercially viable, particularly systems that maximize planting density, such as the vertical system in this study. However, the area utilized for this trial was limited, and the results may not be directly applicable to a commercial scale operation. Further testing is necessary to evaluate scalability.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Thanks to all members of the CEA Crop Physiology and Production and Horticultural Physiology labs at the University of Georgia for assisting with this experiment.
