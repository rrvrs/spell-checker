</self-uri><abstract><p>A highly contagious infection caused by human adenovirus species D (HAdV-D), epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) results in corneal subepithelial infiltration (SEI) by leukocytes, the hallmark of the infection. To date, the pathogenesis of corneal SEI formation in EKC is unresolved. HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1 protein) is an alarmin expressed in response to infection and a marker of sepsis. Earlier studies using a different adenovirus species, HAdV-C, showed retention of HMGB1 in the infected cell nucleus by adenovirus protein VII, enabling immune evasion. Here, using HAdV-D we show cell-specific HMGB1 secretion by infected cells, and provide an HAdV-D specific mechanism for SEI formation in EKC. HMGB1 was secreted only upon infection of human corneal epithelial cells, not from other cell types, and only upon infection by HAdV-D types associated with EKC. Acetylated HMGB1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, then to the extracellular milieu, was tightly controlled by CRM1 and LAMP1, respectively. Primary stromal cells when stimulated by rHMGB1 expressed proinflammatory chemokines. In a novel 3D culture system in tune with the architecture of the cornea, HMGB1 released by infected corneal epithelial cells induced leukocytic infiltrates either directly and/or indirectly via stimulated stromal cells, which together explains SEI formation in EKC.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Ocular surface infection by human adenovirus species D causes epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), a highly contagious form of pink eye. The most significant long-term complication of EKC is corneal subepithelial infiltrate (SEI) formation. SEI appear as round, grayish white opacities in the corneal stroma just beneath the corneal epithelium, and cause discomfort and blurred vision. SEI represent the clinical manifestation of immune cell migration into the subepithelial region in response to adenovirus infection. However, the mechanism of SEI formation after adenovirus infection of the cornea remains unknown. In our study, we found that a secretory protein, high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), is specifically released by adenovirus infected human corneal epithelial cells. We show that HMGB1 stimulates proinflammatory responses by corneal stromal cells beneath the epithelium. Using a novel 3D cultured &#x0201c;cornea in a test tube&#x0201d;, we show that HMGB1 expression by infected corneal epithelial cells induces immune cell migration to the corneal stroma, similar to SEI formation in adenovirus infected human eyes. This explains the means by which adenovirus infection of the corneal surface epithelium induces inflammation in the underlying corneal stroma. HMGB1 is a viable therapeutic target for preventing the vision-threatening complications of EKC.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>NIH</institution>

Adenoviruses are highly prevalent causes of infection, and although less likely to cause death, are also associated with epidemics with significant associated morbidity, mortality, and societal costs [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Different adenoviruses utilize disparate means of viral entry and generate unique immune response signatures that also differ by target cell type and tissue [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The conjunctiva is the mucous membrane lining the entire ocular surface except for the contiguous epithelial cell layer of the cornea &#x02013; conjunctival infection by viruses is often also associated with infection of the cornea (keratoconjunctivitis). In the United States the direct and indirect costs of conjunctivitis have been estimated to approach 1 billion USD annually [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], with human adenoviruses (HAdVs) the cause of ~60% of all cases [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. HAdVs are divided into 7 species (A-G), with HAdV-D comprising more than 70% of the 116 genotypes currently in GenBank. HAdVs cause infections at all mucosal sites, with ocular infections particularly common. Most adenovirus infections, including those of the ocular surface, are self-limiting and resolve without serious sequela. However, in epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), affected individuals develop stromal keratitis, manifest as delayed-onset corneal subepithelial infiltrates (SEI), leading to chronic and/or recurrent visual dysfunction in a significant proportion of cases [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Likely due to evolution of new adenoviruses [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], EKC has recently become more frequent, more severe, and more wide spread across both Asia [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and Europe [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and viruses within HAdV-D are the most frequent cause. To date, the mechanism of SEI formation in the cornea after EKC has remained elusive [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>HMGB1 is a multi-functional protein that acts both as a chromatin-binding protein [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and as a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) when released [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], with immune stimulating properties. Disappointingly, many foundational studies on how its oxidation state impacts its immunomodulatory functions have been either retracted or underscored with expressions of concern [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, it is believed that the oxidation status of HMGB1 determines its specific role in pathogenesis [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. There are three main forms of HMGB1, all-thiol or reduced HMGB1, disulfide or partially oxidized HMGB1, and fully oxidized HMGB1. The all-thiol form (reduced cysteines 23, 45 and 106) directly stimulates leukocyte recruitment via the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], while di-sulfide HMGB1 (partially oxidized at cysteines 23 and 45) is a potent proinflammatory cytokine with high affinity to TLR4 [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Prior studies using HAdV-C5 showed that adenovirus protein VII of species C can bind to and sequester HMGB1 in the infected cell nucleus, leading to suppression of immune signaling by the infected cell [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This has not been shown for viruses within HAdV-D, of for the specific cell types that HAdV-Ds infect.</p><p>Extracellular HMGB1 was first reported as expressed by macrophages treated with LPS [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is now known that HMGB1 secretion can be induced by infection as well as by endogenous stimuli [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Because HMGB1 lacks a leader sequence, it cannot be secreted by a conventional ER-Golgi secretory pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], but instead is released via cytoplasmic secretory vesicles [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. During active secretion, acetylated HMGB1 binds to CRM1 (Chromosomal Maintenance 1, also known as Exportin 1, or XPO1) for nuclear export, and accumulates within cytoplasmic vesicles, such as lysosomes, before extracellular secretion [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Release of HMGB1 can also occur during cell death, including necrosis, necroptosis, apoptosis, pyroptosis, and autophagy-dependent cell death [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to the extracellular space are all necessary steps in its release. Regardless of whether the release of HMGB1 occurs due to cell death, it is the specific post translational state of HMGB1 protein that determines its biological activity.</p><p>Immune cell infiltration is a well characterized and highly conserved response to tissue insult. A vast literature is focused on the processes and mediators of immune cell trafficking during and after any injury, including adhesion molecule engagement [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], cytokine and chemokine receptor-based transduction [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and intracellular signaling [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the mechanisms of leukocyte infiltration in tissues with unique architectures can be highly specific. Compiled reviews on signaling pathways activated by injury and infection have tended to utilize cell monolayers, and have highlighted the molecular crosstalk between pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] within the same cell type. Yet, Rowland and coworkers have demonstrated that no protein has the precisely identical function in different tissues, suggesting that mechanistic studies need also to consider the tissue and multi-cellular context of any injury response [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Whereas the mechanisms identified in infected cell monolayers provide important clues to molecular pathogenesis of infections, immune response mechanisms in the context of a complete tissue architecture need greater study. The cornea has three principal layers. The external surface is comprised of a stratified squamous epithelium (~50 microns thick). The internal most surface is a monolayer of endothelial cells. These two solely cellular layers bound the corneal stroma (~500 microns centrally),which comprises ~90% of the corneal thickness, and consists of a collagenous extracellular matrix populated principally by keratocytes, which when cultured in the presence of serum, are characterized as human corneal fibroblasts (HCF). Herein, we have explored the origin of a highly specific manifestation of adenovirus infection in the human cornea, including potential crosstalk between tissue-specific epithelial cells and fibroblasts. The cornea is uniquely avascular and transparent, and as such provides an exceptional model for molecular studies of infection. This is the first report showing secretion of biologically active HMGB1 by infected corneal cells that is specific both to the viral agent and the infected cell type. Exogenous HMGB1 also induces a robust expression of proinflammatory mediators by corneal stromal cells, consistent with both cell types contributing to SEI formation upon adenovirus infection of the human cornea.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>HMGB1 is released by adenovirus infected cells in cell-specific fashion</title><p>HMGB1 is an alarmin expressed during infection [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], an intermediate in innate immune responses to bacterial DNA [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and a marker of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

Because the trafficking of HMGB1 between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm and then into the extracellular space is tightly controlled, we immunoblotted for HMGB1 in each of these fractions in the two major cell types present in the anterior cornea, corneal epithelial cells, which are the first corneal cells to encounter the virus in natural infection, and HCF, the latter previously proposed as a primary source of proinflammatory mediators leading to keratitis in EKC [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

To better elucidate the timeline of HMGB1 secretion upon HAdV-D37 infection, THE cells were infected for various time points and cytoplasmic HMGB1 was quantified using high content microscopy (HCM). In these images, the primary object (nucleus-blue mask) was identified using three different algorithms (isodata, fixed, and triangle). A region of interest (ROI) of 20 &#x000b5;m was set around each nucleus (grey mask). Within each ROI region of interest, a yellow line indicates the localization of HMGB1 in the cytoplasmic region and a light gray line encircling the nucleus signifies HMGB1 within the nucleus. The movement of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was time-dependent, and began at 8 hpi (<xref rid="ppat.1013184.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, inset iv), with even greater release at 10 and 12 hpi (<xref rid="ppat.1013184.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, insets vi and viii).

By immunoblots on supernatants of infected THE and PCEC, there was no release of either IL-1&#x003b2; or IL-18 (<xref rid="ppat.1013184.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). GAPDH expression was seen only in the infected PCEC supernatants and by 48 hpi (<xref rid="ppat.1013184.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>) was still minimal.

Beyond its physical barrier function, mucosal epithelial cell expression of innate immune mediators are by definition among the very first cellular responses to infection. In respiratory epithelium infected by SARS-CoV-2, viral infection initiates expression of type I and III interferons, leading to a cascade of hyperinflammatory responses that ultimately create tissue destruction and loss of respiratory function [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. In comparison to studies in other tissues, those detailing epithelial cell responses to infection and their mechanisms at the ocular surface have been relatively few [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Most adenovirus infections are self-limiting, but in EKC corneal inflammation (manifest as SEI) can be prolonged or relapse repeatedly for months to years after infection in up to one-third of patients [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although there have been multiple studies detailing a potential role for keratocytes in the corneal stroma in the induction of SEI after adenovirus infection [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], there is to date no evidence that adenoviruses can invade through the dense stromal extracellular matrix of the cornea to directly infect stromal cells. Therefore, the molecular mechanism(s) behind SEI formation has remained uncertain. Herein, we show expression of the alarmin HMGB1 by infected human corneal epithelial cells, and in a unique 3-dimensional corneal facsimile model that epithelial cell expression of HMGB1 is sufficient for SEI formation.</p><p>In airway epithelial cell monolayers infected with HAdV-C5, adenoviral protein VII binds to the A-box of HMGB1 and sequesters HMGB1 in the cell nucleus [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], effectively repressing its alarmin functions [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Posttranslational modifications of protein VII were necessary for its binding to HMGB1. However, comparison of the amino acid sequences of protein VII from HAdV-C and HAdV-D showed only ~73% identity, suggesting species-specific function. Importantly, others have demonstrated that acetylation of HMGB1 is the key driver of nuclear to cytoplasm translocation [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. We show herein that HAdV-D37 infection of both immortalized and primary corneal epithelial cells is associated with HMGB1 acetylation, CRM1-dependent nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation, and LAMP1-mediated release of into cell supernatants, in contrast to infection of the same cells by HADV-C5. Nuclear extracts prepared from HAdV-D37 and HAdV-C5 infected THE cells show negligible to no expression of protein VII in the nucleus of the HAdV-D37 infected cells in contrast to the HAdV-C5 infected cells, in which there was a time dependent increase in protein VII expression. These latter data suggest protein VII of HAdV-D37 may function differently during infection to that of HAdV-C5. HAdV-D appears to be a unique HAdV species from the perspective of its evolution [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], and the organization and function of many of its proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. If protein VII does not accumulate in the nuclei of HAdV-D infected corneal cells, it cannot effectively sequester HMGB1 to prevent its egress.</p><p>Using a 3-dimensional corneal facsimile to model natural infection of corneal tissue, infection of corneal epithelial cells by HAdV-D37 was sufficient to induce SEI and the expression of MPO by infiltrating cells, consistent with chemokine activity. SEI formation and MPO expression in infected corneal facsimiles were both blocked by an HMGB1 inhibitor. Treatment of the uninfected corneal facsimiles with rHMGB1 was sufficient to induce SEI and expression of MPO, showing specificity for HMGB1 in SEI formation. These data strongly implicate HMGB1 as a key mediator of SEI formation after infection of corneal epithelium by cornea-tropic adenoviruses. The data also demonstrates how seemingly canonical molecular pathways, determined in specific cell lines in monolayer culture, do not necessarily translate well to other cell types or to human tissues with different extracellular matrices and varied cellular architectures [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For example, we previously demonstrated that the entry and trafficking pathways for HAdV-D37 in human corneal epithelial cells and fibroblasts involved unexpected and non-canonical mechanisms [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Our results using corneal epithelial cell-tropic HAdVs to infect primary corneal cells strongly suggest that HMGB1 expression is both cell and virus-specific, and further confirm the need to carefully parse disease mechanisms in relevant cell types and experimental models.</p><p>HMGB1 release in SARs-CoV-2 infection was recently reported to be both &#x0201c;active&#x0201d;, i.e., due to post-translational modifications (acetylation), and &#x0201c;passive&#x0201d;, i.e., due to cytolysis at the time of cell death [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. In reality, all cell death that is not instantaneous, as for example due to direct and sudden trauma to the cell, involves cell signaling and can be considered an &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; process. In our experiments, adenovirus infection of corneal epithelial cells induced HMGB1secretion when LDH release was still below cytopathic levels, and when cells were visually intact upon inspection by microscopy. Infected corneal epithelial cell supernatants also tested negative for pyroptotic pathway components for up to 48 hpi. Although cytolysis of corneal epithelial cells occurs at late stages of adenovirus infection [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], and this may contribute to total extracellular HMGB1 expression, it is acetylation of HMGB1 that is necessary and responsible for nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation and subsequent secretion [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], and it is acetylated HMGB1 that is proinflammatory. Additionally, since adenovirus infection did not alter levels of total HMGB1 mRNA or protein in corneal epithelial cells, it appears to be specifically the post-translational acetylation of HMGB1 that mediates its secretion. CRM1 has been shown to tightly regulate the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1 and is proposed to be the principal pathway for biologically active HMGB1 secretion [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. HMGB1 was previously reported to colocalize with LAMP1 in secretory vesicles in the cytoplasm [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Other studies showed that HMGB1 can be secreted by a nonclassical pathway through partially distinct vesicles [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and that its secretion can be PKR activation dependent [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>].</p><p>We found that silencing CRM1 expression reduced HMGB1 nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation, causing retention of HMGB1 in cell nuclei. Knockdown of LAMP1 led to retention of HMGB1 in the cytoplasm even after 24 hpi, when acetylated HMGB1 would otherwise have appeared in cell supernatants. These particular outcomes are consistent with existing canonical pathways of HMGB1 trafficking [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Corneal epithelial cell expression of acetylated HMGB1 upon adenovirus infection occurs in a context, and any approach that ignores the expression of other mediators by the same epithelial cells or the impact of HMGB1 on other corneal cells understates the complexities inherent to biologic processes. We also explored the effects of recombinant HMGB1 on corneal stromal cells (HCFs), finding a robust upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MCP-3, and MIF. Upregulation of CXCL12 was particularly notable, because CXCL12 forms a heterocomplex together with HMGB1 and the CXCR4 receptor, creating an axis for signaling and other cellular functions [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our bioinformatics data confirmed a general upregulation of proinflammatory mediators in rHMGB1 treated HCFs, particularly for chemoattractants and proinflammatory cytokines. This is consistent with a role for keratocytes in amplifying a direct chemokine effect of HMGB1 in the cornea. Gene ontology and KEGG analyses further illustrate the potential molecular and cellular pathways induced by the interaction of corneal epithelial cell-derived HMGB1 with underlying stromal keratocytes. RAGE and TLR4 are the best established HMGB1 receptors [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. When treated with rHMGB1, HCF expression of both RAGE and TLR4 increased as compared to the buffer treated cells, and RAGE expression was increased even relative to treatment with LPS. Further downstream signaling events were induced in HCF by rHMGB1, including phosphorylation of ERK and NFkB, both previously shown to be downstream of RAGE and TLR4 binding [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], and reportedly a feature of other quite disparate disease states [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Further studies will be needed to determine to what degree HMGB1 expressed by infected corneal epithelial cells penetrates the corneal extracellular matrix to interact with HCF. In infected 3-dimensional corneal facsimiles, HCF were dispensable for SEI formation and MPO expression. Therefore, the impact of HMGB1 on HCF in adenovirus infection is likely additive.</p><p>Human tissue infections induce complex and varied cellular responses dependent on the pathogen, the cell type(s) infected, the local tissue architecture, the interactions and molecular cross-talk between the various cell types within the tissue, and the impact of infiltrating immune cells and their byproducts. HAdVs infect in species-specific fashion, and existing <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> models of adenovirus keratitis rely on infection with very high titers of virus and are bereft of viral replication [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Our results in a 3-dimensional human corneal facsimile model of adenovirus keratitis are consistent with a principal role for corneal epithelial cell-derived, acetylated HMGB1 in the formation of SEI. Stromal infiltration by exogenous immune cells, migrating against gravity, occurred regardless of whether HCF were present in the construct, and also occurred in uninfected constructs exposed to rHMGB1 alone, consistent with a principal role for HMGB1 in adenovirus keratitis. Further study is necessary to determine the specific redox state of corneal epithelial cell-expressed HMGB1. Because infection induced the infiltration of immune cells even in the absence of HCF in the construct, it appeared that the expressed HMGB1 was acting as a chemokine, consistent with a reduced form of the molecule. Alternately, subsequent chemotaxis may have been due to other mediators expressed by infected corneal epithelial cells. However, because rHMGB1 alone induced a similar phenotype of inflammation, it appears that stromal cells are not requisite to the formation of SEI. Such conclusions were possible only with use of the 3-dimensional model, and would have been missed in a monolayer culture system.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that HMGB1 expression by infected corneal epithelial cells is sufficient for corneal stromal inflammation and SEI formation in adenovirus keratoconjunctivitis, representing the missing link between infection of the overlying epithelial cells and subsequent infiltration of the underlying corneal stromal extracellular matrix by immune cells. Suppression of HMGB1 for treatment of sepsis, ischemia, cancer, and autoimmune disorders is currently the focus of multiple clinical trials applying a range of unique HMGB1 antagonists [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], suggesting significant potential for translation to patients with adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Method details</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Cell culture and virus preparation</title><p>Primary HCF were isolated and pooled from donor corneal tissue as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1013184.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].

</p><p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p><p>
<bold>Part I - Summary</bold>
</p><p>Please use this section to discuss strengths/weaknesses of study, novelty/significance, general execution and scholarship.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;Saha et. al., present the results of a study focusing on mechanisms involved in the formation of corneal infiltrates due to Adenovirus group D viruses. These infiltrates interfere with vision resulting in substantial costs. They hypothesize that infection of corneal epithelial cells results in the release of pro-inflammatory mediators that then act on stromal keratocytes to promote inflammation. This could explain the formation of the infiltrates in the absence of stromal cell infection. They focus on HMGB1 based on previous work. They used various continuous cell lines as well as primary corneal epithelial cells and primary stromal keratocytes and a novel 3D corneal cell culture system. The data indicate cell and virus specific effects on HMGB1 expression and release from cells and show that an Adenovirus C (not associated with ocular infection) behaves very differently in terms of affecting HMGB1. Cytokine profiles are compared and showed a number of pro-inflammatory mediators are induced by HGB1 treatment in stromal cells. In the 3D system they demonstrate that HMGB1 treatment results in chemotaxis of neutrophils into the corneal stroma. Overall the work is comprehensive, well designed, and the data support the conclusions. There are a couple of minor issues that should be considered.</p><p>1. The opening sentence of the introduction could be deleted since is it not directly relevant. Just start with the Adenovirus introductory material.</p><p>2. In Figure 8 panel C the IF photos of the infiltration are not very convincing and not quantitative. They provide quantitation using blotting for meyeloperoxidase, however. It might be more convincing to include additional panels or insets at higher magnification showing the infiltrates into the stroma.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The is a generally well-written manuscript describing mechanistic studies on a common, virulent and highly contagious type of corneal infection. Specifically, the authors describe a novel molecular mechanism that leads to corneal subepithelial infiltration (SEI) formation, a key event in this infection. The research findings add valuable new insights into the pathogenesis of adenovirus-induced keratitis, and present a new understanding of the immunological processes involved with potentially broader implications.</p><p>The authors provide substantial evidence that secretion of biologically active HMGB1 by infected corneal cells is specific both to the viral agent and the infected cell type. They show that HAdV-D37 infection of immortalized as well as primary corneal epithelial cells are associated with HMGB1 acetylation, CRM1-dependent nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation, and LAMP1-mediated release into cell supernatants, in contrast to infection of the same cells by HADV-C5. An important strength of this study is using the 3-dimensional corneal facsimile to simulate and model natural infection of corneal tissue in addition to a monolayer model.</p><p>Although broadly well-designed and supported, several aspects of the manuscript could be improved for clarity and accuracy.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;In this study, Saha et al. have examined how Human Adenovirus D regulates HMGB1 to control epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC). They show that HAdV-D induces cell-specific secretion of HMGB1 which is regulated by CRM1 and LAMP1-mediated cellular signals. They then establish a new 3D culture system that mimics corneal architecture, exhibiting HMGB1 release that induce leukocytic infiltrates. These findings uncover new insights into the biology of HAdV, establish new physiologic platforms to mechanistically investigate HAdV biology and develop inhibitors to HAdV infection. The authors present their findings in a logical and easy-to-follow manner, with schematics summarizing the findings of each figure, making the manuscript easy to follow. While the findings of this study are potentially exciting, they will benefit from some orthogonal validation assays and characterization of their new infection models, which are described in the Comments.</p><p>
<bold>Part II &#x02013; Major Issues: Key Experiments Required for Acceptance</bold>
</p><p>Please use this section to detail the key new experiments or modifications of existing experiments that should be <underline>absolutely</underline> required to validate study conclusions.</p><p>Generally, there should be no more than 3 such required experiments or major modifications for a "Major Revision" recommendation. If more than 3 experiments are necessary to validate the study conclusions, then you are encouraged to recommend "Reject".</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;None.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;None noted</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;Fig. 5 &#x02013; It is unclear why GAPDH is not observed in these samples. Regardless, these western blots require a loading control. The LPS-treated samples should be run with AdV infected THE cells to show the dynamic range of IL1b and IL18 induction. More concerning, however, is that in Fig. 5C the antibody does not seem to detect significant induction of IL1b and IL18 activation by LPS. This discrepancy should be resolved.</p><p>Chromatin fractionation studies are needed to determine whether nuclear HMGB1 is sequestered on host chromatin in the presence of protein VII from HAdV-D37 or whether it is remaining in a soluble state in the nucleoplasm. Along those lines, HAdV-D37 protein VII-HMGB1 coIP&#x02019;s would also be beneficial for demonstrating direct interactions of HAdV-D protein VII with host HMGB1.</p><p>The findings of the siCRM1/siLAMP studies should be orthogonally validated by fractionation experiments combined with immunoblots to determine whether the HMGB and viral protein VII is associated with host chromatin, in the nucleoplasm or cytoplasm.</p><p>A timecourse of the infection of the 3D culture is needed to provide a proper characterization of this exciting new system of viral infection.</p><p>Fig. 3F &#x02013; the western blot should be rerun to resolve protein VI and VII more clearly.</p><p>
<bold>Part III &#x02013; Minor Issues: Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications</bold>
</p><p>Please use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;See the comments above.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;General:</p><p>The underlying rationale for the choice of MOI used in various experiments, or the potential impact if any of using different levels, is not well explained. For example, in figures 3A and 4B, cell viability and LDH assay, confocal microscopy (line 631) and pyroptosis assay (line 685) used HAdV-D37 infection of cells at an MOI of 1, whereas high content microscopy (line 652) and siRNA lockdown (line 671) used MOI5. Why the choices and do those differences matter?</p><p>A strength of the paper is the multiplicity of orthogonal approaches taken to discover and define the unique interactions that occur in their infection model, but a weakness is in the logical flow in which these are presented. In some cases, discussion of the results and comparison to other studies would better be reserved for the Discussion section. Specifically, the presentation from the first results &#x0201c;HMGB1 is released by adenovirus infected cells in cell-specific fashion&#x0201d; to the &#x0201c;HMGB1 acetylation is cell and virus specific&#x0201d; flows fairly smoothly and the logic is clear. However, the transition into &#x0201c;HMGB1 secretion upon viral infection is independent of pyroptosis&#x0201d; would benefit from some explanation as to why this is the next logical question to flow from those findings since other mechanisms may also impact HMGB1 secretion.</p><p>Specific:</p><p>Lines 114-119: These are not part of the results but could be of greater value in the introduction to explain lines 101 -102 about why potential crosstalk between tissue-specific epithelial cells and fibroblasts is a key issue.</p><p>Lines 163-164: Why were THE rather than PCEP cells chosen to elucidate the timeline of HMGB1 secretion upon HAdV-D37 infection here?</p><p>Line 205: Fig 3b should be Fig 3B for consistency</p><p>Lines 206-207: &#x0201c;HMGB1 cytoplasmic translocation occurred with infection by HAdV-D9 (Fig 3B)&#x0201d;. Figure 3B shows that this is also true for HAdV-D37 and HAdV-D56?</p><p>Lines 212-214/Figure 3D: Did the authors use a reference sequence to make the phylogenetic tree or an outgroup?</p><p>Lines 218-219/Figure 3E: &#x0201c;The protein VII amino acid identity and similarity scores comparing HAdV-D (types 9, 37, and 56) and HAdV-C (types 2 and 5) ranged between 72.41 to 73.63% and 79.31 to 80.60%, respectively (Fig 3E)&#x0201d; but only the comparison between D37 and C5 is shown in Figure 3E. Potentially, description of the % identity in the text may be enough without the figure.</p><p>Lines 274-284: This section could be clearer and more concise. Since Figure 5A shows a schematic representation of corneal epithelial cell release of HMGB1 based largely on what is known from the literature, highlighting many of the mechanisms that influence HMGB1 secretion, this would seem to be an ideal opportunity to explain why the authors then focused on pyroptosis.</p><p>Lines 327-328: Are the authors implying a distinction between CRM1 and exportin 1 XPO? If not, it would be better to stick to one nomenclature throughout.</p><p>Lines 353/Figure 6: Although the authors mentioned that &#x0201c;HMGB1 was previously shown to partially colocalize in LAMP1 containing vesicles&#x0201d;, there are other pathways and molecules involved not tested that should be considered in the Discussion.</p><p>Lines 361-362/Figure 6G: As mentioned above, there are other pathways and molecules involved that are not tested. Figure 6G seems to imply that only LAMP1 is involved, which should be clarified.</p><p>Lines 375-377/Figure E-H: Authors perform substantial bioinformatic analysis, however the main outcomes of that analysis could be better explained. Further it detracts that the text in these figures is blurred.</p><p>Line 477, references 80-83: Are there more recent studies that bear on this point?</p><p>Line 583: Typo, should be C02</p><p>Lines 592-593: streptomycin 100g/ml is likely missing a mu.</p><p>Figures:</p><p>Figure 3G: I did not see a reference to this in the text. The figure may not be essential.</p><p>Figure 4C: Scale and control are missing on the WB.</p><p>Figure 4E: What new results does this figure provide?</p><p>Figure 7C (as well as E, G and H): text is difficult to read.</p><p>Supplemental Figures:</p><p>S1C: Please add scale and positive control in the WB.</p><p>SD-G: Text in these figures seems blurred.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;The manuscript would benefit from thorough editing for grammatical correctness.</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ext-link-type="uri">what does this mean?</ext-link> ).
