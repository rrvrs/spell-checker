Patient encounters were identified in the EHR if they had at least one of the following: a virus-specific billing code (ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM), an antiviral indicated for the target pathogen, or a positive laboratory test. We identified virus-specific billing codes and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) laboratory results by searching for the virus name and related terms (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, &#x0201c;adenovirus&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;adenoviral pneumonia&#x0201d;).

SARS-CoV-2 (n [distinct episodes]=28,729) and influenza virus (n=19,784) were the largest cohorts, followed by RV (n=1,620), hCoV (n=1,437), and RSV (n=1,161) and the smallest cohorts, hMPV (n=486), PIV (n=400), and ADV (n=238).</p><p id="P20">Across all cohorts, participants were predominantly female (61&#x02013;68%) with median ages mostly between 50 and 58 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S6</xref>).

All other options (Asian, multiple selected, Middle Eastern or North African, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) were rare (0&#x02013;2.2%). SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus participant demographics most closely mirrored the overall <italic toggle="yes">All of Us</italic> cohort with ICD, laboratory, or medication data. These two groups more frequently self-reported as White (50.4&#x02013;60.1%) and were more frequently employed with higher reported income, education, and employer-provided insurance. Demographic data were only notably missing for insurance type (46,487/265,222=17.5% for all participants with EHR data). Test count per person was higher among infected cohorts than tested cohorts for each virus.</p><p id="P21">Episodes commonly consisted of either laboratory results alone (predominant for RV [74.7%], PIV [65.0%], SARS-CoV-2 [31.3%], hMPV [32.9%]) or single ICD codes (predominant for ADV [45.8%], hCoV [43.1%], RSV [35.4%], influenza [34.8%]) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Antiviral use varied markedly: SARS-CoV-2 episodes rarely included antiviral prescriptions (4.57%), while medication-only episodes were frequently observed for influenza virus (22.9%), even after excluding prophylactic prescriptions.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Phenotype Performance for Detecting True Positives</title><p id="P22">To understand the diagnostic performance of varying ICD codes for an episode, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, and PPV for each virus across <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> ICD codes per episode using non-antigen test results as a reference standard (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The sensitivity of using one or more ICD codes varied between viruses and decreased as the minimum <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> ICD codes increased.

First, for influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, the PPV for one or more ICD codes was lower (69.7% and 68.8%, respectively), but increased as minimum <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> ICD count increased (78.1% and 76.7% for at least 2 ICD codes, respectively) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Second, for non-influenza, non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses, the PPV was high and did not change substantially as ICD count increased (89.7&#x02013;97.3%). Third, hCoV initially demonstrated a high PPV (79.5%) that decreased as ICD count increased (71.8% for at least 2 ICD codes) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3A</xref>).</p><p id="P24">During the COVID-19 pandemic, hCoV ICD code counts spiked above historical maxima despite an absence of positive tests (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3B</xref>).

As with the medication-exclusive phenotypes, specificity and PPV increased with each additional ICD code for the medication-inclusive influenza and SARS-CoV-2 cohorts. While only a small proportion (1,345/28,741=4.67%) of SARS-CoV-2 episodes included a prescription for remdesivir, molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir, the addition of medication to the phenotype did increase PPV for this subset of 1,345 participants (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). For influenza virus, medication use alone was poorly predictive (PPV=46.8%), but combining medications with 1 ICD code improved PPV compared to 1 or more codes alone (87.1% vs. 69.7%, respectively) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Varying ICD code thresholds and antiviral requirements in the entire influenza and SARS-CoV-2 cohorts demonstrated an expected trade-off in performance (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For both viruses, at least one ICD code or medication was the most sensitive phenotype (76.0% influenza virus and 45.1% SARS-CoV-2), but this caused the highest number of false positives and the lowest PPVs (65.8% and 68.8%, respectively). For influenza virus, by requiring at least two ICD codes or a medication accompanied by an ICD code, the lower sensitivity (47.7%) was accompanied by a marked reduction in false positives (778 to 238) and increase in PPV (65.8% to 79.8%).

Using temporal, geographic, and sensitivity analyses, we described important performance insights into respiratory virus phenotyping. All phenotypes exhibited high specificity, though trade-offs exist between accuracy and sensitivity for influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="P36">We identified epidemiological patterns and cohort sizes that matched national surveillance data. The combination of laboratory results, ICD codes, and medications increased case detection beyond what any component alone could identify, which was valuable where laboratory testing was less frequent (e.g., the Southeast). The cohorts varied in size: approximately 20,000&#x02013;30,000 episodes for influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 compared to 200&#x02013;1,600 for other viruses, likely reflecting increased clinical suspicion and testing for common pathogens rather than true differences in disease burden.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> These cohorts could be used to investigate host genetic factors, health disparities, geographic and environmental risk factors, and clinical outcomes across respiratory viral infections. The longitudinal available also supports study of lifestyle factors through wearables and patient-reported outcomes from surveys.</p><p id="P37">Phenotype performance varied substantially between viruses, across episode composition, and over time. Virus-specific ICD code sensitivity varied widely: higher for influenza (66.8% vs. 38&#x02013;95% in published studies) and RSV (55.2% vs. 24%) and moderate for SARS-CoV-2, ADV, hMPV, and hCoV (33&#x02013;44%), but very low for PIV (8.3% vs. 14% and RV (9.2% vs. 0%).<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> While non-influenza, non-SARS-CoV-2 virus-specific ICD codes showed high PPV regardless of count (89.7&#x02013;97.3%), single ICD codes for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza were less predictive (68.8&#x02013;69.7%).<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> For medication-inclusive cases, ICD codes had a higher PPV for influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 episodes, and for SARS-CoV-2, antivirals alone were highly predictive of test results, although receipt of remdesivir, molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir was rare (4.57% of all episodes) during the study period.</p><p id="P38">The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the seasonal transmission of most respiratory viruses, granting the opportunity to assess ICD code performance in unexpected settings and demonstrating the importance of evaluating code performance over time for seasonally variable diseases. hCoV ICD codes were inappropriately used to identify concern for COVID-19 infection, with diminished but persistent effects throughout the study period. Apart from rhinovirus, our phenotypes only rarely identified false positive episodes during the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly attributable to influenza virus episodes composed of a single ICD code. We suspect that these episodes reflect clinical concern for infection rather than true infection, and indeed, adjusting the influenza phenotype from any ICD code or medication to 2+ ICD codes or medications accompanied by an ICD code markedly reduced false positives and increased PPV. In this work, we suggest choosing phenotype characteristics that match the research question and desire to maximize sensitivity vs. PPV.</p><p id="P39">Level-of-care analyses revealed patterns suggesting systematic detection biases toward higher acuity settings. Our phenotype identified a high frequency of infections at emergency and inpatient visits for RV, hMPV, RSV, ADV, PIV, and hCoV, compared to more outpatient visit types for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus. These findings differ from established hospitalization rates: CDC estimates suggest that only 1&#x02013;2% of medically-attended influenza cases require hospitalization, while COVID-19 hospitalization rates ranged between 2.1% and 68% over this study period, with temporal trends showing a decrease from ~50% in the early pandemic to 20% by July, 2022.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Moreover, prospective studies in adults have shown that other respiratory viruses show either similar or lower hospitalization rates compared to influenza - the opposite of our results.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,16</sup> This discordance suggests that the <italic toggle="yes">All of Us</italic> computable phenotype oversamples high levels of care, particularly for non-influenza, non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses, likely due at least three factors: the lack of cost-effective outpatient assays, an absence of specific therapeutic interventions that would justify multiplex testing costs in lower-acuity care settings, and the utility of identifying an etiology in the inpatient setting, where cessation of antibiotics or discharge are considerations.</p><p id="P40">Several limitations affect the interpretation and generalizability of these findings. The low sensitivity for all viruses indicates that this method cannot be used to study disease prevalence, as nonspecific syndromic coding likely predominates for upper respiratory illnesses. Additionally, the requirement for data conversion to a common data model before release in curated data repositories means this method cannot support real-time surveillance. In addition, while <italic toggle="yes">All of Us</italic> provides broad national coverage, it highly sampled some states (AZ, MA, WI, AL, PA, IL, MI, NY, MS, CA) and left approximately half the US population sampled below rates of 1 in 10,000. The program&#x02019;s intentional oversampling of populations historically underrepresented in biomedical research, while invaluable to health equity research, also results in demographics that differ from the overall US population. Other known impediments to generalizability compared to the US population include decreased representation of blind and deaf participants; difficulty in linking EHRs from a considerable portion of <italic toggle="yes">All of Us</italic> participants; and the decreased representation of persons of Asian, Middle Eastern or North African, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander heritage in this cohort.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p><p id="P41">Finally, this work faces challenges common to EHR-based research. These include labeling bias, implicit clinician biases which could be influenced by demographics, and informed presence bias where EHR inclusion typically reflects illness rather than routine care.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> The minimal representation of urgent care and post-acute care in our data further underscore the disconnected nature of healthcare in the US, and identifies a likely gap in infection detection in this cohort.</p><p id="P42">Despite these limitations, our computable phenotypes reliably detected geographic and temporal patterns of infection matching national surveillance, although severe infections are oversampled and many mild infections are likely missed. This work supports a need for expanded surveillance of non-influenza/non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens in routine medical care.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Using a cohort that is expected to continually grow, our results enable future studies of genetic susceptibility and clinical outcomes research across both well-studied and understudied respiratory viruses.
