Stupor is a state of numbness of almost all personality functions, accompanied by stiffness, lethargy and abulia (lethargy). A person in a state of stupor is recognized by the fact that he is constantly silent, does not respond to stimuli at all, refuses food, has a motionless body posture, a face immobile like a mask, a gloomy and absent look. We can call a person who is in a stupor only by calling loudly, shaking hard and similar charms. Catatonic stupor is a state of complete loss of spontaneous and active movement, the patient stands stiffly for hours, sits, does not take food, does not speak but registers everything that is happening around him because his consciousness is not clouded.</p></sec><sec id="sec8255"><title>Objectives</title><p>Here, we report on the case of a 32 year-old man.&#x000a0;He was brought in the Emergency Center by his mother with the eyes shut and unresponsive to all sorts of verbal and gestural attempts to elicit any kind of response, with extreme complete body&#x000a0;rigidity.
