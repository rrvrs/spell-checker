However, current methods are limited to small perturbation panels and the detection of a narrow subset of protein-coding RNAs. We present Perturb-DBiT, a distinct and versatile approach for the simultaneous co-sequencing of spatial total RNA whole-transcriptome and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), base-by-base, on the same tissue section. This method enables unbiased discovery of how genetic perturbations influence RNA regulation, cellular dynamics, and tissue architecture in situ. Applying Perturb-DBiT to a human cancer metastatic colonization model, we mapped large panels of sgRNAs across tumor colonies in consecutive tissue sections alongside their corresponding total RNA transcriptomes. This revealed novel insights into how perturbations affect long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) co-variation, microRNA&#x02013;mRNA interactions, and global and distinct tRNA alterations in amino acid metabolism linked to tumor migration and growth. By integrating transcriptional pseudotime trajectories, we further uncovered the impact of perturbations on clonal dynamics and cooperation. In an immune-competent syngeneic mouse model, Perturb-DBiT enabled investigation of genetic perturbations within the tumor immune microenvironment, revealing distinct and synergistic effects on immune infiltration and suppression. Perturb-DBiT provides a spatially resolved comprehensive view of how genetic knockouts influence diverse molecular and cellular responses including small and large RNA regulation, tumor proliferation, migration, metastasis, and immune interactions, offering a panoramic perspective on perturbation responses in complex tissues.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health including grants U54CA274509, UH3CA257393, RF1MH128876, U54AG079759, U54AG076043, U01CA294514, R01CA245313, RM1MH132648 (all to R.F.); as well as NIH (R33CA281702), DoD (HT94252310472), and Foundation (CRI4964) grants to S.C.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">CRISPR is as a powerful tool for precise genome editing, enabling genetic manipulation to study functional genomics in a variety of biological systems, including developmental biology<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, neuroscience<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, cancer<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, and immunology research<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, where it has been demonstrated to uncover the impact on gene expression and elucidate tumor initiation, development, and metastasis mechanisms<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>&#x02013;<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.

Recent advancements in single-cell multi-omics technologies and pooled single-cell CRISPR screening have revolutionized our understanding from genomics to functional genomics by elucidating how genetic alterations affect transcriptional outputs, influence cellular heterogeneities, and key biological pathways at single-cell level<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>&#x02013;<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.

CRISPR droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) enables pooled CRISPR screens with single-cell transcriptome resolution using droplet microfluidics<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, taking genetic screening into the single-cell era.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a spatially organized ecosystem where cell-to-cell interactions and spatial cues play critical roles in cancer development and progression. Understanding how genetic perturbations influence these interactions and the underlying mechanisms is essential for developing effective therapies. Spatial CRISPR genomics developed by Dhainaut et al.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> uses ProCode, an antibody-based method, to detect a set of gRNAs and correlate them with spatial transcriptome from a serial tissue section, uncovering tumor clone-specific transcriptional outputs. Other spatial CRISPR screen technologies, largely based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) imaging, emerge to address the limitation in spatial context by combining CRISPR-based genetic perturbations with various spatial transcriptomic assays, uncovering some of the unknown drivers of tumor clonality while obtaining information about the spatial architecture of the sample, revealing how specific gene perturbations and their associated phenotypes influence neighboring tissue or cellular regions<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>&#x02013;<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. However, these methods have yet to achieve joint mapping of perturbations and transcriptome on the same tissue section, often limited by the size and pre-defined nature of the CRISPR libraries used, and as of today, are unable to provide the information beyond gene expression, such as large and small non-coding RNA and post-transcriptional regulation.</p><p id="P6">To develop next-generation spatially resolved functional genomics, we introduce &#x0201c;Perturb-DBiT&#x0201d; (Perturbation compatible Deterministic Barcoding in Tissue) for spatially resolved, unbiased, pooled <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> CRISPR screening via spatially co-barcoding total RNA transcriptomes and sgRNAs followed by high-throughput base-by-base next-generation sequencing (NGS) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). This approach provides a panoramic view of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> perturbation-induced spatial alterations in molecular and cell biology, including gene expression, RNA regulation, cellular dynamics, and cell-cell interaction all in the same tissue section. Crucially, Perturb-DBiT enables the spatial profiling of diverse RNA species, including large and small non-coding RNAs such as lncRNA, microRNA, tRNA, etc., in a spatial <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> CRISPR screen, unveiling their critical regulatory roles in post-transcriptional control, cellular metabolism and function, and their impact on cellular responses following CRISPR perturbations. Through the preservation of spatial architecture, we provide a method to elucidate in several cancer models how genetic perturbations alter RNA regulation and subsequently influence tumor colonization, expansion, dynamics, and tumor-immune interaction. Our method can be potentially expanded to spatial mapping of genetic variants in other high throughput screen systems<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> or lineage tracing studies<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Perturb-DBiT Workflow</title><p id="P7">Perturb-DBiT is developed with two alternative approaches to co-profile single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and spatial transcriptomes within the same CRISPR-screen-mutagenized tissue, which we demonstrate as polyadenylated capture (PAC) and direct-capture (DC) (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Both methods are compatible with fresh-frozen (FF) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. In Perturb-DBiT PAC, FFPE CRISPR-screen-mutagenized tissue section is firstly processed with deparaffinization and heat-induced crosslink reversal, while FF tissue processing starts with 1% PFA fixation. Following tissue permeabilization, enzyme-induced <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> polyadenylation enables the co-detection of both large and small RNA, as well as sgRNA, by covalently attaching adenosine residues to the 3' end of RNA molecules, forming a poly(A) tail (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Bulk reverse transcription (RT) requires a biotinylated poly-dT reverse transcription primer with a poly(T) oligo, unique molecular identifier (UMI), and a ligation linker (10mer). Next, spatial barcoding is executed using two polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices, each featuring 50 or 100 parallel microchannels, and each with channels oriented in directions perpendicular to one another<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>,<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Distinct spatial barcodes Ai (i = 1&#x02013;100, 8mer) and Bj (j = 1&#x02013;100, 8mer) are utilized with the first and second PDMS device respectively, with imaging after each barcoding step to preserve the tissue's region of interest (ROI) for downstream processing. After lysis and template switching, PCR is used to extract barcoded mRNA cDNA and sgRNA for the downstream workflow. Perturb-DBiT PAC PCR utilizes two primers specific to the TSO-end and Barcode B-end of the transcript. Following PCR, a size selection-based purification approach is then used to achieve separation between endogenous RNA and sgRNA. As the polyadenylation process adds poly(A) tails to all RNAs, and not just the biomolecules of interest, cDNAs originating from rRNAs are selectively removed from amplicons to circumvent the loss of low-abundance transcripts<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Separated and purified sgRNA and mRNA cDNA are then used as input for library preparation prior to NGS. Perturb-DBiT DC follows similar tissue preparation (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Following tissue permeabilization, bulk RT is performed using two distinct RT primers: a biotinylated polyd(T) primer and a direct capture primer, each with a UMI and ligation linker (1 or 3, respectively). The polyd(T) primer uses an oligo dT to capture inherently polyadenylated RNA while the direct capture primer uses a &#x0201c;capture&#x0201d; sequence that is complementary to the scaffold sequence on the sgRNA constant region. Here, mRNAs were captured using a barcode Ai (i = 1&#x02013;50, 8mer), linker 1, barcode Bj (j = 1&#x02013;100, 8mer), and linker 2, while sgRNAs were captured using a barcode Ci (i = 1&#x02013;50, 8mer), linker 3, barcode Dj (j = 1&#x02013;100, 8mer), and linker 4 (see Extended Data Fig. 1d). Through extensive optimization (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary table S1), we achieved high capture efficiency of the spatial barcodes and sgRNA. After lysis and template switching, Perturb-DBiT DC PCR selectively amplifies sgRNAs and mRNAs using three primers: a common primer at the TSO-end, paired with either a Barcode-D end primer for sgRNAs, or a Barcode B-end primer for mRNAs. The resulting product is then physically separated using SPRI bead purification and used as input for library preparation prior to NGS. Perturb-DBiT PAC and DC offer two complementary methods to co-profile sgRNA and endogenous RNA transcriptome from CRISPR-screen-mutagenized tissue sections while preserving spatial architecture. By combining CRISPR-based genetic perturbations with spatial total RNA transcriptomics, Perturb-DBiT provides a powerful yet flexible tool for unbiased investigation of cell state, function, and dynamics <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> regulated by a variety of RNA molecules in response to genetic alterations, adding a new and integral dimension to spatially resolved multi-omics (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 1a).</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Perturb-DBiT performance evaluation</title><p id="P8">We evaluated Perturb-DBiT in several in vivo CRISPR animal models with either FFPE and FF tissues from SMARTA TCR transgenic spleen, B16-OVA mouse tumor, autochthonous mouse liver tumors, HT-29 lung metastatic colonization and E0771 syngeneic lung colonization tumors, representing a broad spectrum of cancer types and cancer immunology experimental designs (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Samples were perturbed with sgRNA pooled screens ranging in size from a small pool of 2 or 86 sgRNAs, to a larger pool of 288 sgRNAs, and extending to the use of genome-scale sgRNA libraries containing approximately 80,000 gRNAs. Furthermore, we successfully employed Perturb-DBiT with lentivirus, retrovirus, and AAV viral vector delivery methods. This versatility underscores Perturb-DBiT's adaptability, making it suitable for a broader range of experimental applications. Perturb-DBiT consistently generated high-quality spatial transcriptomics data across diverse tissue types (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Notably, one PAC HT-29 lung metastatic colonization FFPE sample yielded an average of 3,371 genes and 6,429 UMIs per spot for exonic molecules, while intronic molecules had a mean of 7,903 genes and 21,821 UMIs per spot. On the other hand, an adjacent DC HT-29 lung metastatic colonization FFPE sample yielded 1,467 UMIs and 1,130 unique genes per spot, suggesting that the PAC method may outperform DC in mRNA capture. These results demonstrate Perturb-DBiT's ability to capture comprehensive total RNA transcriptional profiles, even in challenging FFPE samples, in an untargeted genome-scale manner.</p><p id="P9">Perturb-DBiT demonstrated robust sgRNA capture performance across a range of CRISPR screen libraries and experimental conditions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref> and Supplementary Table S1). We successfully and unbiasedly detected from 2/2 to 265/288 unique sgRNAs in our regions of interest (ROI) and between 754 and 17,548 unique total sgRNA UMIs with 1&#x02013;106 QC-passed sgRNA UMIs per spot, dependent on the size of the CRISPR screen library and the sample type. Notably, we were able to detect 5,740 unique sgRNA UMIs (1&#x02013;26 UMIs/spot) from a genome-scale-CRISPR library-mutagenized PAC lung metastatic colonization sample, accounting for all 52% of the tissue-containing spots and representative of 250 unique sgRNAs. As expected, the detected sgRNAs are a fraction of the whole library due to the tissue mapping region representing only a fraction of the whole tumor, yet the result obtained from a single tissue slide is already the among the largest number of perturbations detected in a spatial in vivo CRISPR screen. To assess the consistency of sgRNA capture multiple across sections, we analyzed a series of adjacent sections of genome-scale CRISPR screen-mutagenized HT-29 lung metastatic colonization samples with similar ROIs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Between five adjacent sections, we were consistently able to capture the top six sgRNAs hits, demonstrating the ability for Perturb-DBiT to capture the most important and biologically relevant genetic perturbations.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Perturb-DBiT ensures precise sgRNA fidelity and recapitulation across small and medium sized CRISPR screening libraries</title><p id="P10">To demonstrate Perturb-DBiT's broad applicability for spatially profiling sgRNAs, we started with three models using small (2 NTC or 86 sgRNA) and medium-sized (288 sgRNA) CRISPR libraries and different modes of CRISPR vector delivery (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 2a). For the small sgRNA library, B16 (melanoma) OVA-Cas9-GFP cell lines were transduced with retroviral CRISPR sgRNA library targeting 38 epigenetic genes (two sgRNA sequences per gene and 10 NTCs). Perturb-DBiT PAC enabled the efficient capture of 78 out of 86 sgRNAs (&#x0003c; = 35 UMIs/spot), with sgRNAs detected in 90% of all tissue-bearing spots, demonstrating robust spatial and sgRNA coverage. Specificity was demonstrated by significant overlap between sgRNAs targeting the same gene relative to the ROI (Extended Data Fig. 2c). We applied the same dual-guide direct capture lentiviral sgRNA vector with 2-NTCs to an immune-editing model transducing only CD4 + SMARTA T cells<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> in splenic tissue. Perturb-DBIT DC again revealed overlapping NTC sgRNAs (1&#x02013;5 sgRNA UMI/spot) relative to the ROI. We further utilized immunofluorescence (IF), revealing sgRNA alignment with the B-cell zone, suggesting that CD4 + SMARTA cells are mostly differentiated to follicular helper (Tfh) cells and interact with B cells at day 6 post-LCMV infection<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

The mTSG RNA library was delivered by AAV into LSL-Cas9 knock-in mice<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, utilizing an all-in-one construct that included both sgRNA and a liver specific promoter (TBG promoter) to drive Cre specific expression in liver cells. AAV-CRISPR-mediated pooled mutagenesis drives autochthonous liver tumorigenesis in this immunocompetent mouse. Following mutagenesis, the mouse received immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment of anti-PD-1 (aPD-1) and samples were processed for Perturb-DBiT DC sgRNA capture. SgRNAs were detected in nearly 75% of the ROI profiled, with up to 106 UMIs detected per spot (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). Notably, Perturb-DBiT captured 263/288 sgRNAs in the mTSG panel. Since AAV vectors do not integrate into the host cells' genomic DNA, unlike lentiviral vectors in most CRISPR screens, this study used molecular inversion probe sequencing (MIPS) to capture the mutational landscape and test sgRNA activity. Comparatively, the previously published MIPS analysis from multiple sections of the same tissue block detected 86 unique sgRNAs overlapping with our data, validating that Perturb-DBiT recapitulates 100% of the enriched sgRNAs from the MIPS analysis<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Moreover, Perturb-DBiT demonstrates remarkable sensitivity, detecting roughly 3-fold the amount of sgRNAs captured by MIPS in just a 1.25&#x000d7;1.25 mm ROI, highlighting the high sensitivity and capture efficiency to detect sgRNA perturbations using spatial Perturb-DBiT as opposed to the gold-standard bulk <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> CRISPR screen analysis.</p><sec id="S4"><title>Perturb-DBiT enhanced sgRNA capture and transcriptome spatial mapping reveals tumor origin and oncogenic pathways in liver using CRISPR-mediated genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs)</title><p id="P12">After confirming successful recapitulation of sgRNAs in the aPD-1-treated liver CRISPR-GEMM sample, we applied Perturb-DBiT PAC co-profiling to an adjacent section of the same treated liver block using a 50-micron spot size device to capture a larger ROI (5&#x000d7;5mm). Perturb-DBiT detected an average of 5,092 UMIs/spot and 2,595 genes/spot and unsupervised clustering revealed 6 distinct transcriptomic clusters characterized by differentially expressed gene (DEG) markers. Spatial clustering aligned closely with the histology from an adjacent section stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E), delineating tumor zones, liver parenchyma, and the central vein (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, and Extended Data Fig. 2f,g).

Perturb-DBiT PAC again demonstrated superior sgRNA capture efficiency of the mTSG-targeting CRISPR-screen library compared to traditional pooled amplicon sequencing via MIPS. In the same tissue section, Perturb-DBiT captured 43% of total sgRNAs, while MIPS captured only 30%<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Additionally, Perturb-DBiT recapitulated 95% of the 57 mTSG target genes, capturing more sgRNA diversity than the gold-standard MIPS (80%) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). Receiver-operator curve analysis revealed a trend toward improved true sgRNA detection accuracy compared to the published MIPS data with an AUC of 0.724 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). While an acceptable model for correct sgRNA classification, this recapitulation result is particularly remarkable given the spatial sequencing nature of Perturb-DBIT and the select ROI analyzed compared to the traditional bulk pooled sequencing. We identified the top 10 sgRNA hits using Perturb-DBiT, which exhibited a heterogeneous spatial distribution, reflecting the inherent genetic and phenotypic diversity of primary tumors (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>). We next integrated sgRNA and transcriptomics profiling through dimensional reduction of Mixscape perturbation scores (pUMAP), which allowed us to differentiate cell populations based on their response to specific perturbations (Extended Data Fig. 2h). This defined clusters by their major perturbation (&#x0003e; = 20% of clustered spots) and included non-perturbed (NP) spots serving as a reference point to enable a direct comparison between perturbed and NP cells. Notably, top pUMAP cluster <italic toggle="yes">sgMll2</italic>, also emerged as a top depleted hit from the MIPS data yet is enriched in this dataset.

Our data also revealed that sg<italic toggle="yes">S100A4</italic> knockout distinctly upregulates tyrosine tRNA expression. This finding aligns with previous studies suggesting that <italic toggle="yes">S100A4</italic> expression in cancer is regulated through receptor tyrosine-protein kinase <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic>, which activates the ERK signaling pathway<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. The upregulation of tyrosine tRNA in the absence of <italic toggle="yes">S100A4</italic> may therefore reflect an adaptive response to this altered signaling, highlighting a potential link between <italic toggle="yes">S100A4</italic> mediated signaling and metabolic shifts in cancer cells. Further, differential tRNA expression analysis for each top sgRNA hit of our screen (Extended Data Fig. 4) revealed that sg<italic toggle="yes">ADARB1</italic> knockout resulted in a global downregulation of tRNAs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Given the critical role of tRNAs in protein synthesis, this suggests a profound disruption of protein metabolism, potentially impacting cellular processes reliant on rapid protein turnover, such as cell migration. ADARB1, an A-to-I editing gene, is known to modify tRNAs and other RNA species, influencing their stability and function<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>. Therefore, the observed downregulation of tRNAs could reflect a disruption in <italic toggle="yes">ADARB1</italic>-mediated RNA editing, further exacerbating the metabolic and functional effects in the knockout cells. Spatial mapping of sg<italic toggle="yes">ADARB1</italic> knockout cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>) revealed their failure to integrate into tumor colonies, instead remaining dispersed in the interstitial space &#x02013; an outcome distinct from other top ranked perturbations in the screen like sg<italic toggle="yes">MT1E</italic> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>,<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">d</xref>), which exhibited global tRNA upregulation and robust tumor colony formation. Given this pronounced migratory deficit and inability to extravasate albeit high viability to survive in circulation, we next examined the key features associated with cell migration such as lamellipodium organization (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>), where sg<italic toggle="yes">ADARB1</italic> knockout significantly downregulated genes within this pathway, reinforcing its role in mediating cell motility. To contextualize the specificity of <italic toggle="yes">ADARB1&#x02019;s</italic> role in migration, we performed pathway-level clustering of DEGs (Extended Data Fig. 5), which revealed a significant effect of <italic toggle="yes">sgADARB1</italic> downregulating genes related to chromatin organization, DNA repair and cell cycle regulation compared to other top perturbations. This finding underscores the essential role of <italic toggle="yes">ADARB1</italic> in maintaining migratory capacity. Conversely, knockouts of <italic toggle="yes">sgSEMA6B, sgMT1E</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">sgS100A4</italic> resulted in strong upregulation of these lamellipodium-related genes, suggesting a potential inhibitory effect on lamellipodia formation, cell migration, and potentially metastasis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">SgSEMA6B</italic> knockout cells led to an upregulation of cysteine tRNAs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) which are required for filopodia formation<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>. Together with lamellipodia, these related structures contribute to cell motility<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>. This may suggest a potential mechanism by which <italic toggle="yes">sgSEMA6B</italic> regulates cell migration and invasion. Notably, the role of <italic toggle="yes">MT1E</italic> in regulating cell migration has been highlighted in HCC, where knockout of <italic toggle="yes">MT1E</italic> in HCCLM3 cells significantly increased migration<sup><xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>. Additionally, xenograft mouse models revealed <italic toggle="yes">MT1E</italic> as a novel tumor suppressor, inhibiting migration and invasion and inducing apoptosis. In our study, we similarly identified <italic toggle="yes">MT1E</italic> as a tumor suppressor (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), further supporting its role in regulating cell motility, migration, and cancer metastasis. To further explore the role of <italic toggle="yes">MT1E</italic> in regulating cell migration, we performed a pathway analysis of <italic toggle="yes">sgMT1E</italic> DE mRNA, which highlighted key pathways such as leukocyte migration, taxis, and cell chemotaxis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). While the functional implications of these pathways in our model remain to be fully understood, these findings suggest that <italic toggle="yes">MT1E</italic> may influence signaling networks involved in cell movement within the TME.</p><sec id="S8"><title>Spatial profiling of microRNAs and microRNA-mRNA regulation in responses to top ranked perturbations in the tumor colonies</title><p id="P19">Beyond tRNA dysregulation, we also observed broad alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression. Our Perturb-DBiT screen revealed significant changes in several miRNAs (fig.

Subsequent miRNA-mRNA interaction predictions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>) highlighted putative target genes impacted by sg<italic toggle="yes">MT1E</italic> perturbation, implicating this factor in broader post-transcriptional regulation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>). Strikingly, spatial mapping demonstrated a precise overlay between sg<italic toggle="yes">MT1E</italic> and elevated miR-21 expression (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref>), suggesting that sg<italic toggle="yes">MT1E</italic> directly or indirectly suppresses <italic toggle="yes">miR-21</italic> expression. MT1E is a key regulator of oxidative stress<sup><xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup>, and its loss may allow for <italic toggle="yes">miR-21</italic> to escape suppression, promoting tumor progression. Target correlation analysis between mRNA and miRNA revealed that miR-21 may lead to suppression of target genes like <italic toggle="yes">TUBA4A</italic> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>,<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">i</xref>), disrupting microtubule dynamics and promoting chromosomal instability, which has been linked to tumor recurrence and metastasis<sup><xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup>. These findings, together with the striking spatial congruence observed between sg<italic toggle="yes">MT1E</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">miR-21</italic> upregulation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref>), underscore a spatially coordinated <italic toggle="yes">MT1E-miR-21</italic> regulatory axis with profound implications for tumor progression and therapeutic targeting.

Briefly, HT-29-Cas9 cells were transduced with either a non-targeting control, <italic toggle="yes">AAVS1</italic> sgRNA control, or target sgRNA lentivirus. <italic toggle="yes">AAVS1</italic> is a well-characterized &#x0201c;safe harbor&#x0201d; locus in the human genome, unlikely to disrupt essential genes if edited and is a reliable positive control<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup>. After 3-day selection via puromycin and T7E1 assay validation (Extended Data Fig. 6b) of sgRNA genome editing, tumor cells were seeded at a density of 5,000 cells and resulting cell colonies were analyzed after two weeks. Colony formation assays validated tumor suppressor function of sg<italic toggle="yes">SEMA6B</italic>, sg<italic toggle="yes">MT1E</italic>, sg<italic toggle="yes">S100A</italic>, and sg<italic toggle="yes">ASAH2</italic> from the Perturb-DBiT top ten enriched hits (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 6c).This was exemplified by the inclusion of four previously reported tumor suppressors (<italic toggle="yes">ARHGAP6</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CREBZF</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">DHRS7C</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">NR4A3</italic>)<sup><xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup>&#x02013;<sup><xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup>, whose corresponding sgRNAs were abundantly detected by Perturb-DBiT. Knockout of these genes, except for <italic toggle="yes">DHRS7C</italic>, which was shown to promote tumor colony growth (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). We next calculated hazard ratios of gene perturbations across various cancer types depicting potential tumor suppressor and promotor activity (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Notably, in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), most of the top ten sgRNA hits are classified as tumor suppressors, suggesting the target genes' role in growth inhibition. In contrast, other cancers including HT-29, which is classified as colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD), exhibit a mix of tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting activities in our data. These results suggest the unique capability of Perturb-DBiT in identifying functional perturbations in a spatially relevant context across this genome-scale sgRNA library.</p><p id="P21">We next sought to investigate the effect of CRISPR perturbations on the tumor cell transcriptional state and dynamics. First, we examined the relationships between these top perturbations and key oncogenic pathways. We compared the effects of our top four perturbations including NP (non-perturbed) spots serving as a control on genes associated with known HT-29 oncogenic modulators: <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CDH1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CYNNB1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MET</italic> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). This analysis revealed the diverse functional consequences of the top hits identified by Perturb-DBiT across various oncogenic drivers. Moreover, these results suggest that the top sgRNA perturbations not only vary in their overall effect on cancer types, but also show specificity in how they interact with distinct oncogenic pathways, highlighting Perturb-DBiT's application to elucidating potential pathway-specific vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically targeted. Secondly, we observed that the spatial distribution of these top sgRNA hits typically follows a pattern of both dispersion and concentration within different tumor colonies (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j</xref>). This suggests that sgRNA enrichment might be indicative of the direction of tumor differentiation or progression. Consequently, by using Monacle3<sup><xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup>, we conducted pseudotime analysis with spatial transcriptomics data from tumor cells containing sgRNAs. Intriguingly, the distribution patterns of the sgRNAs for sg<italic toggle="yes">SEMA6B</italic>, sg<italic toggle="yes">MT1E</italic>, and sg<italic toggle="yes">S100A4</italic> - three of the four validated tumor suppressors- align well with the tumor differentiation pseudotime trajectory, suggesting the formation of diverse tumor genotypes in a single pooled screen that can recapitulate a spectrum of tumor differentiation dynamics, from regions with fewer sgRNAs to colonies with substantial sgRNA enrichment (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>,<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). Thirdly, Perturb-DBiT co-profiling data enabled identification of perturbation-associated molecular signatures along the differentiation trajectory. DEG analysis was conducted between spots containing sgRNAs for four tumor suppressors validated in this study and spots containing all other sgRNAs. This revealed significant downregulation (Padj &#x0003c; 0.05, Log<sub>2</sub>FoldChange&#x0003c;-1) of multiple genes known to inhibit tumor growth, along with upregulation (Padj &#x0003c; 0.05, Log<sub>2</sub>FoldChange &#x0003e; 1) of a few oncogenes (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). This may partially explain why knocking out sg<italic toggle="yes">SEMA6B</italic>, sg<italic toggle="yes">MT1E</italic>, sg<italic toggle="yes">S100A4</italic>, or sg<italic toggle="yes">ASAH2</italic> may significantly promote tumor colony growth. Further, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>) of the DEGs revealed that knocking out sg<italic toggle="yes">ASAH2</italic> was associated with activation of pathways involved in cellular signaling and regulation, such as protein kinase activity<sup><xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup>, which plays a role in tumor cell survival, adhesion, and metastatic potential. These findings suggest a potential role for <italic toggle="yes">ASAH2</italic> in modulating key signaling networks involved in tumor progression. In summary, Perturb-DBiT enables efficient <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> co-profiling of sgRNAs from a genome-scale human CRISPR library alongside whole transcriptomes. Analysis of the sgRNA data allows for a precise visualization of tumor colonies and rapid identification of functional perturbations on transcriptional state. Concurrently, the transcriptome data analysis reveals genetic modulators that are highly relevant to diverse aspects of tumor biology. For the first time, the integrated analysis of both datasets permits the un-biased spatial uncovering of perturbation-associated molecular signatures including both mRNA and large and small non-coding RNA using a genome-scale CRISPR library.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Perturb-DBiT identifies genes modulating the tumor architecture and immune composition of the tumor microenvironment in an immune-competent animal model</title><p id="P22">We next aimed to use Perturb-DBiT to investigate how different gene perturbations impact the TME. To do this, we transduced E0771 cells, a well-characterized mouse syngeneic cell line, with a pool of lentiviral vectors encoding the genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout library (Brie)<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. The Brie library comprises a total of 19,674 genes and 78,637 unique sgRNAs. Intravenous injection of E0771-Cas9-GFP-Luciferase Brie library cells into 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice led to tumor colony formation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). After 21 days, lung tissues were collected for Perturb-DBiT PAC co-profiling. Within the ROI (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) containing at least four anatomically identifiable major tumors, a total of 91 unique sgRNAs and 17,548 sgRNA UMIs were identified (Supplementary Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 7a). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of all sgRNA-targeted genes reveals primary involvement in the regulation of cell growth and developmental processes, highlighting significant roles in stem cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and various embryonic and tissue development stages (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Concurrently, Perturb-DBiT detected an average of 1,995 genes and 4,458 UMIs per spot (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Cell type-specific marker genes were then identified by unsupervised clustering, uniquely characterizing their expression within each individual cluster for clear distinction from other groups (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 7c). Notably, the distribution of these clusters displayed a strong concordance with tissue morphology (Extended Data Fig. 7d). For example, cluster 4 defined lymph nodes (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">c</xref>), and cluster 0 almost completely overlaps with airway epithelial cells (Extended Data Fig. 7d). Moreover, we observed that two clusters, cluster 1 (C1) and cluster 2 (C2), exhibited conspicuous and distinctive spatial patterns despite their proximity within the same tumor region (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). C1 is defined by DEGs such as <italic toggle="yes">Orc2</italic>, which drives DNA replication<sup><xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> and <italic toggle="yes">St3gal4</italic>, which plays a significant role in tumor progression by promoting neutrophil adhesion to selectins<sup><xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup>. C2 exhibited upregulation of oncogenes <italic toggle="yes">Pvt</italic><sup><xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup> and <italic toggle="yes">Gse1</italic><sup><xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup>, as well as tumor suppressor gene <italic toggle="yes">Cdh13</italic><sup><xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>, and Extended Data Fig. 7e). However, these distinct genetic profiles alone are not sufficient to definitively differentiate the two tumor clusters.</p><p id="P23">In this instance, we attempt to uncover the mechanisms underlying the distinct characteristics of the two tumor clusters by examining gene perturbations. We selected the top ranked sgRNAs to visualize their spatial perturbation burden and distribution (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a significant enrichment of the sgRNA for sg<italic toggle="yes">Zc3h12a</italic> within Cluster C1. <italic toggle="yes">Zc3h12a</italic> has been established as a key negative regulator of inflammation, and its deficiency leads to a pro-inflammatory environment<sup><xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref></sup>, which is a driver of immune cell infiltration<sup><xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref></sup>. Consistent with the perturbed <italic toggle="yes">sgZc3h12a</italic> spatial region in our data, this suggests a localized area of immune dysregulation in the subcluster of C1 proximal to lymph nodes. On the other hand, sgRNA profiles within C2 exhibit marked heterogeneity. NEU4, a sialidase that removes sialic acids from glycoconjugates, has been shown to reduce the motility of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by cleaving sialic acids on CD44, thereby enhancing cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix<sup><xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref></sup>. Consequently, the preferential enrichment of sg<italic toggle="yes">Neu4</italic> sgRNA in C2 suggests potential mechanisms contributing to increased cellular motility and elevated levels of tumor metastasis. Furthermore, we observed that sg<italic toggle="yes">Pax8</italic> is scarce in C1 but shows a strong distribution pattern within C2 and overlaps with C0 and C1 in Tumor 1 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">c</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). Functionally, <italic toggle="yes">Pax8</italic> is a lineage-defining transcription factor essential for the survival of differentiated epithelial cells (via <italic toggle="yes">Tp53inp1</italic> regulation)<sup><xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref></sup> and its presence across distinct transcriptional clusters indicates that this key regulator is being targeted in various cellular states within this tumor microenvironment. Given that Cluster 0 denotes airway epithelial cells, Extended Data Fig. 7d), the presence of <italic toggle="yes">sgPax8</italic> in this cluster aligns with Pax8's known role in epithelial lineages. Interestingly, within C1 we observe a spatial divergence, with the cluster appearing in both upper and lower regions of our spatial map (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). This separation, despite the shared transcriptional identity influenced by Pax8, highlights the potential influence of different local microenvironmental cues or spatial contexts on cellular behavior, even within a defined transcriptional state, made clear by Perturb-DBiT. To further examine whether the distinct spatial patterns of sgRNAs observed in C1 and C2 tumors correlate with complex intercellular communication within the TME, we conducted a spatial ligand-receptor (L-R) analysis using the co-profiled transcriptomic data. Differential L-R analysis across all identified spatial populations revealed unique interaction profiles (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>). Comparing C2 to C1, the top enriched L-R pairs included <italic toggle="yes">Lamc1-Itgb1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Calm1-Cacna1c</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Lamc1-Itga6</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Ntn1-Unc5b</italic>. These signaling pathways are known to enhance extracellular matrix (ECM) organization<sup><xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref></sup>, calcium signaling<sup><xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref></sup>, tumor cell adhesion to the ECM<sup><xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref></sup>, and angiogenesis<sup><xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref></sup>, respectively. These processes may drive the divergence of C2 tumors from C1, as highlighted by the spatial perturbation analysis performed by Perturb-DBiT.</p><p id="P24">Then, to validate the immune infiltration and exclusion in sgRNA-perturbed tumors, we utilized co-detection by indexing (CODEX) with a 27-plex protein panel, including both immune and tumor cell markers (Supplementary Table 2), on an adjacent section. Herein, we focus on three anatomically identifiable tumors 1, 2, and 3. The CODEX imaging revealed significant overlap with transcriptomic cluster 4 in the lymph nodes, characterized by elevated expression of pan-B cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>). Additionally, the analysis highlighted a presence of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells near the lymph nodes of the C1 tumor, potentially due to the pro-inflammatory environment facilitated by sg<italic toggle="yes">Zc3h12a</italic>-specific sgRNA enrichment. In contrast, while PD-L1 expression was nearly undetectable in C1, it was significantly elevated in C2 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>), indicating a more pronounced immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.</p><p id="P25">CODEX segmentation and clustering has identified distinct cellular clusters, such as pan-B cells (cluster 3), pan-T cells (cluster 4) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref> and Fig. S7F), yet they were limited within the tumor lesions (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Nonetheless, we discerned three major CODEX clusters (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">j</xref>) that co-localize with GFP tumor cells: cluster 0 (CC0), cluster 1 (CC1), and cluster 2 (CC2). Notably, CC1 predominates in C1 tumors, whereas CC0 is scarce; by contrast, C2 features a disproportionately high percentage of CC0. Specifically, compared to CC1, CC0 exhibited expressed elevation of F4&#x02013;80, Cd45, Cd169 and Cd11b, indicative of macrophages, alongside Cd11c and MHC II, markers characteristic of myeloid compartment dendritic cells (DCs) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref>). The high amounts of F4&#x02013;80 and Cd11b in C2 (Tumor 3) further support a significant enrichment of macrophages within its microenvironment, contrasting with the CC1-dominant C1 tumors. This disparity in myeloid cell populations suggests distinct immune landscapes between these tumor types, potentially influencing tumor progression and overall microenvironmental interactions.</p><p id="P26">Taken together, the results highlight that Perturb-DBiT is effective in capturing sgRNAs from immune-competent syngeneic mouse model bearing a genome-scale CRISPR library and concurrently sequencing spatial transcriptomics, showcasing its unparalleled capabilities in revealing tumor and tumor microenvironment heterogeneity. Specifically, in the C2 tumor, multiple tumor-related gene perturbations were detected and potentially result in an enrichment of genotypically diverse cell types and cell-cell communication patterns. These are primarily involved in modulating the tumor architecture to promote tumor progression or migration. Moreover, DCs and TAMs may engage in tumor-supporting procedures within the immunosuppressive TME, contributing to the heightened malignancy of the tumors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">In this study, we introduced Perturb-DBiT, a cutting-edge technology seamlessly integrating spatially resolved detection of sgRNA via base-by-base sequencing with total RNA spatial transcriptome profiling on the same tissue section for spatially resolved in vivo CRISPR screening, offering profound insights into the functional landscape of complex in vivo biological systems. By enabling the simultaneous profiling of genetic perturbations and total RNA transcriptomes across various experimental <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> models, Perturb-DBiT enhances our understanding of how genetic modifications influence biomolecular regulation and cellular behaviors within the tissue microenvironment. This versatile platform employs two robust approaches, Perturb-DBiT PAC and DC, to accomplish co-profiling of the biomolecules of interest, accommodating a range of delivery vectors and sgRNA library sizes, and is compatible with both FFPE and fresh frozen samples, making it adaptable for diverse experimental contexts.</p><p id="P28">This technology enables the unbiased spatial uncovering of perturbation-associated changes in total RNA transcriptomes and post-transcriptional regulation and is compatible with CRISPR libraries of any size through its base-by-base sgRNA sequencing capability. Specifically, Perturb-DBiT enables the spatial profiling of non-coding RNAs, marking the first instance of such detection within a spatial CRISPR screen. This capability expands functional insights that can be derived from spatial perturbation experiments, as non-coding RNAs play crucial roles in gene regulation, chromatin remodeling and cellular response. By capturing their spatial distribution alongside the co-profiling of both sgRNAs and mRNAs, Perturb-DBiT provides a more comprehensive view of gene regulatory networks within the tissue microenvironment, potentially uncovering novel non-coding RNA-mediated mechanisms that contribute to tumor progression, metastasis, and immune modulation. Further, we have shown that Perturb-DBiT elucidates tumor suppressor and promoter programs, validated by in vitro data. This spatial resolution empowers the discovery of novel molecular pathways and interactions that drive tumor initiation and progression and tumor clonal dynamics, enhancing our understanding of how genetic modifications influence the spatial organization and immune composition within the TME. This comprehensive approach not only broadens the scope of genetic inquiry, but also lays the groundwork for developing targeted therapeutic strategies based on spatial dynamics. These dynamics, identified by Perturb-DBiT as pivotal in shaping the tumor architecture and immune composition of the TME, hold potential for developing innovative immunotherapies in the future.</p><p id="P29">However, Perturb-DBiT has yet to demonstrate genome-wide CRISPR screening, primarily due to limited sequencing depth and restricted coverage of tissue areas. We anticipate that sequencing tens of serial sections from an entire tumor could capture thousands of unique sgRNAs. Nonetheless, our analysis of five consecutive tissue sections revealed that approximately half of the top-ranked sgRNAs were consistently detected across these sections. This finding highlights the ability to identify the most relevant perturbations, even in the absence of comprehensive genome-wide screening. Another limitation of our current method is yet to realize true single-cell resolution, which may be achieved by fully integrating sequencing-based and imaging-based spatial omics approaches or by further reducing the spot size<sup><xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref></sup>&#x02013;<sup><xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref></sup>. To combine the strengths of histological imaging and deep learning, we applied iStar to produce super-resolved single-cell transcriptome data (fig.

Even with these limitations, this technology provides critical spatial information about sgRNA distribution in an unbiased and base-by-base sequencing fashion which is compatible with using a genome-scale sgRNA library and demonstrated consistent capture of biological relevant sgRNA hits across multiple tissue sections in our studies.</p></sec><sec id="S100"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S103"><title>Mouse Models</title><p id="P32">For SMARTA TCR transgenic and B16-OVA tumor models, mice were housed and bred at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Animal Resource Center in specific pathogen-free conditions.
