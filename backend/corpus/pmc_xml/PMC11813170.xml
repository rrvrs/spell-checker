Adequate ANC attendance and facility birth rates are increasing in Ethiopia but remain well below national goals and global recommendations. Group ANC (G-ANC), when implemented at higher-level facilities, is associated with improved quality and experience of ANC and increased ANC retention and facility-based delivery. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of G-ANC delivered by health extension workers at the health-post level compared to conventional ANC on ANC attendance and facility-based delivery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Group ANC will be piloted in five purposively selected health posts. The study design is a stepped-wedge trial to be conducted in 36 health posts within the catchment of six health centers, with randomization of the order of the intervention introduction done at the health-center level (clusters). The design includes three time periods: a six-month control period with no G-ANC implementation, followed by another six-month period when G-ANC will be introduced in half (n=18) of the study health posts, then a final six-month period when G-ANC will be implemented in the remaining 18 health posts. Each health post will form one cohort and conduct six monthly G-ANC meetings on a fixed day/time. The study will use quantitative and qualitative data collection approaches. The study has &#x0201c;pause and reflect&#x0201d; points designed for intervention iteration before rolling out to the next set of sites. The primary outcomes are the proportion of women with at least four ANC visits and the proportion who delivered in a health facility. Qualitative research will be conducted using in-depth interviews with pregnant women, health workers, facility managers, and regional health managers. The study will enroll 770 women across all phases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study will inform decision-makers locally and globally on whether G-ANC is a feasible service delivery model at the health-post level. Effectiveness of G-ANC at increasing ANC retention and facility-based delivery and its acceptability to pregnant women and health extension workers will be reported.

The abstract has been updated to replace "facility-based delivery" with "birth with a skilled birth attendant" to ensure consistency with existing evidence. The role of health posts has been clarified, explicitly stating that they provide antenatal care but do not offer delivery services, and this distinction is now detailed in the methods section. Additionally, the randomization section has been corrected to accurately define the abbreviation for Point-of-Care Testing (POCT). The qualitative data analysis approach is now explicitly described, specifying the use of thematic analysis, with comprehensive details on data collection methods and participant selection. The manuscript now transparently addresses the trial&#x02019;s termination due to security challenges in the Amhara region. Despite this, data from earlier phases remain valuable and will be submitted for publication. A section has been added to explain the rationale for publishing the protocol, emphasizing scientific rigor and ethical accountability. Furthermore, refinements based on pilot feedback have been incorporated, including enhanced training for health extension workers and modifications to data collection tools. To improve clarity, the study goals and feasibility assessment methods have been refined within the study design section. Consistency has been ensured across various sections regarding participant numbers and health post inclusion criteria. The qualitative interview framework has also been expanded to include detailed descriptions of participants&#x02019; experiences with both ANC and G-ANC. These revisions reflect our commitment to addressing reviewer concerns while maintaining the integrity and transparency of the study.</p></sec></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antenatal care (ANC) uptake is a key measure of progress towards improving maternal outcomes (
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2016a</xref>). Although improvements have been made in the uptake of at least one ANC contact in Ethiopia, attendance for the recommended number of contacts remains low. The 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) reported that 62% of pregnant women aged 15&#x02013;49 received any ANC from a skilled provider, 32% had at least four ANC contacts, and 26% gave birth in a facility (
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">CSA/Ethiopia &#x00026; ICF, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In Ethiopia, women are expected to receive ANC from health centers (HCs) and health posts (HPs) (
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Assefa
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). HCs provide comprehensive maternal health services, and HPs deliver primary health care packages, including ANC (
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Gebretsadik
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Each HC typically has up to five affiliated HPs in its catchment area. HPs are staffed by health extension workers (HEWs) who are salaried female community health workers recruited from the community (
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Kea
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Tsegay
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). HEWs complete a one-year basic health service delivery course, and about 50% have received an additional year of training (
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Ministry of Health Ethiopia, 2022</xref>). HEWs are expected to spend 75% of their time in communities. At least two HEWs are assigned to one HP to serve a population of 3,000 to 5,000 in a village (
<italic toggle="yes">kebele</italic>). Since 2020, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has taken steps to move more ANC services, including diagnostics, to the HP level (
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">FMoH, 2020</xref>). Each HP (where HEWs work) is generally supported by health workers from the nearby HC, who provide supervision, technical support, and clinical services that are beyond the scope of HEWs. Typically, HEWs refer cases that need more advanced care to HCs. The MOH supports several community-based interventions to increase awareness about danger signs and the importance of skilled care at birth, including mobilization of unpaid female volunteers (i.e., women&#x02019;s development army leaders). Also, HEWs coordinate meetings for pregnant women conferences that are conducted monthly at the village level by a nurse/midwife (
<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Asresie &#x00026; Dagnew, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The World Health Organization recommends G-ANC in the context of rigorous research as an alternative to individual ANC (
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2016b</xref>). G-ANC is a transformative service delivery model that provides care to groups of eight to 10 pregnant women of similar gestational age through a series of scheduled meetings (ANC) (
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Sharma
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Several studies have found that G-ANC is associated with increased ANC attendance, improved health literacy and client satisfaction, increased uptake of family planning, improved birthweight, and increased breastfeeding initiation/duration (

<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">McKinnon
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p><p>This study will evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of G-ANC delivered by HEWs at the HP level compared to conventional ANC among women who report intention to receive ANC at the HP level. It builds on existing local efforts and addresses important questions regarding how ANC service delivery might be modified to improve quality (both provision and experience) of care. This proposed study will introduce G-ANC at a lower level of the health system (i.e., the HP) to address a key element of the global G-ANC learning agenda: can the model feasibly be delivered by community-based providers closer to women&#x02019;s own homes and communities, while retaining quality of care and other positive outcomes associated with G-ANC at higher-level facilities (
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Grenier
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). The proposed G-ANC intervention at the HP level will be led by HEWs. G-ANC will build from group education activities at HPs and support service delivery reorganization into G-ANC to test potential improvements in ANC attendance and facility-based delivery, both of which are MOH priorities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This mixed-methods study will use a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial with randomization of the order of the start of the intervention done at the HC level (clusters) in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. The study will begin with a pilot to test the feasibility of the intervention conducted by HEWs at the HP level. If feasible, a randomized controlled trial will be conducted with three time periods: baseline period (T1), time period 2 (T2), and time period 3 (T3), each about six months in duration. The control period for the first half of clusters will occur at T1. These clusters will start G-ANC first at T2. These clusters will have a choice to continue G-ANC with a second cohort of women during T3 (
<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The control period for the second half of the clusters will occur at T2. The second half of the clusters will start the intervention in T3. We plan to use a stepped-wedge study design because it allows for iterative learning (i.e., adaptive management) during the study to modify the intervention, which was novel compared to traditional cluster randomized control trials. The study was registered on September 23, 2021, on clinicaltrials.gov with registration ID: NCT05054491.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="f1"><label>Figure 1. </label><caption><title>Time steps and clusters for G-ANC at the HP level.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="gatesopenres-8-17706-g0000" position="float"/></fig><p>Prior to the intervention, all women in the study HPs will receive the current standard of individual ANC. HPs primarily offer ANC and other preventive services but do not provide delivery care. At the time of the intervention, the HP in the selected clusters will provide G-ANC to one cohort of eight to 10 pregnant women. Group ANC participants will be followed prospectively from the time of study enrollment. All non-enrolled pregnant women in the intervention HP will continue to receive individual ANC. During the control period, care is provided in the same setting (HP) by the same personnel (HEW). The main difference is that the control group receives individual care, while the intervention group receives care in a group-based care model.</p></sec><sec><title>Study setting</title><p>The G-ANC study will be conducted in two zones of the Amhara regional state: West Gojjam Zone (South and North Achefer districts) and the South Gondar Zone (Farata, Dera, and Libokemem districts). Twelve HCs in the Amhara region will be selected as G-ANC study centers. G-ANC meetings will take place at the HP level only. Amhara region has an estimated population of 22.5 million (

At the end of this first ANC visit, eligible women who agree to participate in G-ANC will be added to the G-ANC cohort. Approximately eight to 10 women will be enrolled in a cohort. Cohort membership will be fixed (i.e., the same women and facilitators at each meeting). Two additional pregnant women who meet study criteria can be added to a G-ANC cohort if added to the cohort by the start of the second G-ANC meeting. Six monthly G-ANC meetings will be conducted for each cohort on a fixed day/time at each HP. Each cohort will meet for G-ANC meetings in a designated meeting space that is set up to ensure privacy during clinical consultations. The G-ANC meeting will be conducted by at least one HEW who is trained in the G-ANC service delivery model.</p><p>Each meeting will have the same general structure: self-assessment by the clients/peer-to-peer self-assessment initially taught and supervised by the HEW, such as measurement of weight and blood pressure using an automated cuff; individual assessments/clinical care by the HEW in a private space; discussions around pre-determined and appropriate gestational-age themes using illustrative cards and take-home booklets designed for G-ANC; and plan/reflect and peer-support activities that create group cohesion.

Availability of these rapid test kits improves the quality of ANC and reduces the need for women to travel to the HC for routine screening. The POCT approach was introduced by Enhancing Nutrition and Antenatal Infection Treatment (ENAT) (

In ENAT, HPs started provision of the complete package of ANC services, including tests not provided at non-ENAT intervention HPs in the country or during standard care at the HP level nationally. The study provided test kits to all HPs for the duration of the study.</p><p>The G-ANC intervention and materials were adapted from Jhpiego&#x02019;s G-ANC intervention model, which consisted of five monthly two-hour meetings with clinical assessments alongside structured group discussions and activities that were facilitated by nurses, midwives, or community HEWs (
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Grenier
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). It was modified in collaboration with the MOH for the Ethiopian context as a six-meeting model. The model is designed to increase early entry into ANC and retention in ANC in support of changes to the Ethiopian national ANC guidelines, which increased ANC contacts from four to eight contacts (
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Ministry of Health Ethiopia, 2022</xref>). Intervention materials in Amharic language include a pictorial self-assessment card women use at the beginning of each meeting to record weight, blood pressure, and any danger signs; meeting guide used by the facilitators to guide each meeting; five to six A4-size illustrated picture cards per meeting that are designed for nonliterate audiences (total 36 cards) and questions on the back of each card to foster discussion; an A4-sized booklet with small versions of all the picture cards that women can take home to share what they&#x02019;ve learned with their partners and families; an implementation guide for HEWs to introduce G-ANC in their HP; a simple G-ANC register to aid the facilitator to track attendance and record other data; and three monitoring tools, including a meeting observation checklist to provide feedback and assess fidelity. The picture cards were pretested with HEWs before the pilot phase, and all the intervention materials will be revised as needed based on the pilot feedback. Each intervention HP will be provided with 12 chairs; a basic set of supplies and commodities, including POCT reagents to run activities; two weigh scales; three user-friendly Microlife PSA blood pressure devices for the self-assessments; and one privacy screen to divide the private clinical consultation area from the larger G-ANC meeting space.</p><p>All clients will continue to receive the components of standard care, and no standard therapies will be denied to the intervention group. Likewise, standard, individual ANC care will not be denied if requested at any time.</p><p>

During the intervention period, two HEWs per HP from intervention HP will be trained on G-ANC facilitation, gestational age estimation, and community mobilization for five days. From control HPs, two HEWs per HP will be trained on community mobilization and gestational age estimation for two days. Midwives from intervention HCs who will provide on-site mentorship to HEWs during G-ANC implementation will be trained for four days on G-ANC-focused mentorship by the study team (i.e., senior health professionals from Jhpiego Ethiopia with specialization in maternal health). Midwives from control HCs will be oriented for one half day on community mobilization, screening procedures, and linking women who come to the HC for their first ANC visit to HPs under their catchment. Key stakeholders, including participating health facility managers and regional managers, will be oriented to G-ANC to build ownership and support. Midwives from HC will provide mentorship, supervision, on-the-job support, guidance, and feedback to HEW as they implement G-ANC in their HPs.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>

Verbal consent will be sought instead of written consent as written consent is seen as a personal identifier in the community and verbal consent is preferred. This consenting method was approved by the ethics committee (see Ethics section). The potential G-ANC participants will be informed during the consenting process of the expected number of meetings (i.e., ANC visits) and their rights, risks, and benefits. The research assistant will explain the need to collect their names, phone numbers, and addresses, which will be used for study-related follow-up purposes only. Anyone declining participation in the study will be referred to individual ANC care during the intervention period. A baseline questionnaire will be administered to consenting study participants at the beginning of each step (time period).</p><p>For HEWs and health facility managers, study staff will explain the purpose based on the inclusion criteria. The HEWs will be oriented to the study including the randomization (they will not be blinded to the order of randomization of their HC and affiliated HPs) and their role in the study including screening first-time ANC clients for eligibility to participate. HEWs who will be facilitating G-ANC meetings will be informed that they may be asked to participate in an in-depth interview (IDI) at the end of the study related to implementation of group-based care and its effect on their job and satisfaction levels. Oral consent will be obtained in a private location at the health facility by research assistants.</p><p>For the regional health managers, study staff will contact the regional health bureau responsible for overseeing reproductive health programs in the Amhara region via phone or in-person and invite the regional health manager to participate in an IDI as per the inclusion criteria. An appointment will be scheduled to obtain informed consent and conduct the IDI, preferably at the regional health bureau office. Written consent will be obtained by the research assistant who will conduct the interview in a private location.</p><p>For the IDIs of women and HEWs involved in G-ANC, qualitative data will be collected at the end of the study after all G-ANC meetings have been conducted. Oral consent will be obtained from the HEWs and eligible women three to six months postpartum to be enrolled in the qualitative portion of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Harms</title><p>The intervention in this study is for women to take part in G-ANC.

The pilot phase will determine feasibility, i.e., whether HEWs are able to facilitate the G-ANC meetings, there are enough eligible ANC clients at the HP level, we are able to enroll enough women at the HP who are of a similar gestational age, and women come back to the HP for the G-ANC meetings. After completing at least two G-ANC meetings in the pilot, we will determine the feasibility of moving to Phase 2 of the study. Training modules, data collection tools, and intervention delivery models will be refined, with the added engagement of midwives and health staff, based on pilot study feedback.</p><p>
<bold>
<italic toggle="yes">Trial phase</italic>:</bold> Phase 2 includes T1, T2, and T3. During T1, pre-intervention data will be collected from the first set of 18 HPs by interviewing pregnant women during their pregnancy and again postpartum. The women in T1 will not receive the intervention. During T2, the G-ANC intervention will be implemented in the first set of 18 HPs (first six clusters), and pre-intervention data collection will be conducted in the second set of 18 HPs (i.e., second six clusters). During T3, the G-ANC intervention will be implemented in the second set of 18 HPs. If the first set of 18 HPs chooses to continue the G-ANC intervention with a second cohort, an additional six months of data collection will occur during T3. Participant timeline is depicted in

Participants in the qualitative research will have a single contact for the IDIs.</p><p>The overall duration of the entire study is 25.5 months. The implementation process will be documented in these sites, with some corrective measures expected to be taken after each block, depending on implementation process documentation, findings from pause and reflect sessions, and qualitative study findings before commencing the next block. A transition plan will also be developed by Jhpiego to hand over implementation to the government.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant retention</title><p>Implementation of a paper-based participant tracking system will be used to accurately assess participant retention in the study. The G-ANC registration and participating registration book will be used to track ANC attendance. This will provide the HEWs with a listing of all participants who have missed scheduled G-ANC meetings.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Both quantitative and qualitative data collection approaches will be used in this study. Data will be collected in the pilot phase and then during study implementation (Phase 2).</p><p>Once enrollment begins, all new ANC attendees in the selected HPs will be screened for eligibility during the first ANC contact with a health care provider. The screening and enrollment questionnaire will be completed. Basic demographic data will be collected from all eligible consented women (all who meet the inclusion criteria). All data will be de-identified for those who decline study participation. Baseline and endline data will be collected from all eligible and voluntary women participating in all study time periods. During the first period, data will be collected from 18 control HPs. In the second period (T2), data will be collected from 18 intervention and 18 control HPs. In the third period, (T3) data will be collected from 18 intervention HPs.</p><p>Data quality will be monitored through the use of trained research assistants and supervisors, data quality supervision, and use of an electronic data collection program to minimize data entry errors.</p><p>The study team will select respondents for the IDIs at the end of the study based on preliminary findings from the quantitative survey. IDIs with women will be conducted at the end of T2 and T3, after completion of all G-ANC meetings (
<xref rid="T7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). Specific topics/domains to explore with G-ANC participants include satisfaction with care, any perceived changes in self-efficacy or empowerment, health literacy, improved communication and/or trust with providers and the health system as a whole, factors in uptake/non-uptake of postpartum family planning, and the overall impression of the G-ANC model. In this study, we will use standardized pretested tools to assess the levels of empowerment, self-efficacy, and satisfaction. For empowerment and self-efficacy, we will use eight questions related to their current pregnancy and calculate a composite score to understand the woman's level of empowerment. We will ask 11 questions about their satisfaction with the ANC received during their last pregnancy and with the G-ANC for their current pregnancy.</p><table-wrap position="anchor" id="T7"><label>Table 7. </label><caption><title>Data collection timing, per tool.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" content-type="article-table"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="2" valign="top">Data collection tool</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="2" valign="top">Study participant</th><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top">Timing of data collection</th></tr><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">T1</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">T2</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">T3*</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Cluster level information</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">HP level information</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">18 HPs</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">36 HPs</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">18 HPs</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Tool 1a.

<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Hemming
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). If there is variation within the clusters, the statistical analysis will be adjusted based on the pollution levels. The primary analysis will be conducted using intention-to-treat analysis. After exploring balance by time period/intervention status and correlations, the effect of G-ANC will be estimated using generalized linear mixed effects models with binomial distribution and logit-link. The model will include G-ANC as the intervention indicator, time period and their interaction as the primary predictors, and HC as the random intercept. We will adjust for facility- and individual-level characteristics that show imbalance between the intervention vs. control time periods and can be strongly correlated with the outcome scores. The primary outcomes will be compared across time periods both within the intervention and control groups. Comparisons will be made within a given time period (e.g., T1, T2, and T3) for both the intervention and control conditions. The amount of missing data will be assessed for each variable and overall, for the sample. If more than 5% of data on covariates are missing, multiple imputation procedures will be used assuming data are missing at random (

SurveyCTO will automatically capture quantitative data and synchronize with the server. SurveyCTO will be programmed so that automated quality checks and data classification systems will be run. Data will be maintained in a way that preserves their accuracy, integrity, and legibility with user access restrictions and data retrievable by designated personnel only. A security system that prevents unauthorized access to the data will be maintained. The database management system will be password protected, with each member of the research team responsible for data management having their own password. After data collection, ACIPH and JHSPH will de-identify the data. Quality control reports will be sent to the study team bi-weekly indicating missing, overdue data, and outstanding queries during the baseline and endline survey time periods. Throughout the fieldwork, field supervisors and the research team will observe the research assistants conducting interviews and carry out field editing. By checking the research assistants&#x02019; work regularly, the field supervisor can ensure that the quality of the data collection remains high throughout the data collection period. The de-identified dataset will be made available on FigShare or another open access site.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>Study research assistants will be trained in a multi-day training workshop, covering the important points of the approved study protocol, including privacy and confidentiality.

It focuses on the implementation of group ANC at the health post level in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. The intervention aims to determine whether group ANC is a feasible, effective, and acceptable way to promote the uptake of ANC services and facility-based delivery. The paper is well-written and presents a strong rationale for this intervention. I appreciate the inclusion of detailed figures and tables, which enhance the understanding of the study design and deployment.</p><p> My comments are relatively minor and aim to enhance the manuscript's clarity, specifically the reporting of the methods.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The data collection section could be improved by organizing the information under &#x0201c;quantitative data collection&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;qualitative data collection&#x0201d; sub-headings, similar to the format used in the data analysis section. Additionally, providing more details about the main themes of the baseline and endline surveys would be helpful.</p></list-item><list-item><p>On page 4, the authors state that "up to two additional pregnant women who meet study criteria can be added to a G-ANC cohort if added to the cohort by the second G-ANC meeting." A clear rationale for extending the sample beyond the initial 10 women would be helpful, or it could simply be rephrased to indicate recruiting up to 12 women per health post.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Also, on page 4, the authors mention that "the first half of clusters will have a choice to continue G-ANC with a second cohort of women during T3." It would be helpful to clarify what this entails and how it will be monitored. With T3, the authors seem to have an opportunity to investigate the maintenance or integration of group ANC4 among the health posts that received the intervention at T3. Some data collection, even if only with healthcare providers, could be valuable to assess whether health posts were able to integrate group ANC into their practice or if they discontinued it after the intervention concluded.</p></list-item><list-item><p>On page 7, the authors state that the study will be conducted in 12 health centers. For greater clarity, I suggest that the authors specify that the intervention will be delivered at health posts. While I understand that health posts are within the catchment area of health centers, using more precise and consistent language would enhance clarity. In other parts of the document, the authors call health centers "clusters," which may be a more appropriate term.</p></list-item><list-item><p>On page 10, the authors write that "all data will be de-identified for those who decline study participation." Does this mean the data will be deleted? It would be beneficial to detail how the data from those who refuse to participate will be used and interpreted.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Also, on page 10, it is written that "11 questions on satisfaction during the last antenatal care will be asked about the antenatal care received during your last pregnancy and the current pregnancy for this G-ANC." This sentence needs some rephrasing. Is the goal to compare satisfaction from the last pregnancy with that of the current pregnancy? If so, what about women who are having their first child? In line with my first comment, I suggest the authors provide more details on their data collection approaches, particularly as they relate to measuring client satisfaction with the intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Based on the background information provided by the authors regarding the country's specific ANC goals, I expected that the proportion of women attending at least eight visits would be one of the study outcomes. Is the number of ANC contacts collected?</p></list-item><list-item><p>I agree with the authors that conducting descriptive subgroup analyses will be valuable in seeing if outcomes vary by key socio-demographic characteristics. The authors mentioned considering marital status, education, and economic status. I wondered if they also included age and parity, given that the eligibility criteria include all pregnant women starting at age 15.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It would also be helpful to include a specific section on the &#x0201c;pause and reflect&#x0201d; component, highlighting specific reporting outcomes during the pause and reflect sessions to ensure fidelity is measured throughout the project. Additionally, it is unclear if and how that information will be used in the analysis to compare implementation between T2 and T3.</p></list-item><list-item><p>I did not see any information on how women who develop pregnancy complications will be handled. The paper is not very clear on that point. Would they be referred for further care and excluded from the intervention for the remainder of the study? Also, what about women enrolled in the intervention who seek ANC outside of the group sessions? How would that information be collected and included in the analyses?</p></list-item></list> Thank you once more for an excellent paper on a very important intervention.</p><p>Is the study design appropriate for the research question?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Is the rationale for, and objectives of, the study clearly described?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are sufficient details of the methods provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?</p><p>Not applicable</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>Epidemiology, maternal and child health, implementation sciences</p><p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reviewer-report" id="report38845"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21956/gatesopenres.17691.r38845</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer response for version 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mengesha</surname><given-names>Meresa Berwo</given-names></name><xref rid="r38845a1" ref-type="aff">1</xref><role>Referee</role><contrib-id contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3645-6600</contrib-id></contrib><aff id="r38845a1">

However, I would also like to know if the study includes maternal and perinatal outcomes associated with this model of care, in addition to the continuum of maternal health care services, such as attendance at antenatal care and utilization of institutional delivery. Furthermore, if the follow-up study is postponed to the postpartum period, it would be beneficial to include the utilization of other services, such as postnatal care and postpartum family planning, as there is a scarcity of data on these topics.</p></list-item><list-item><p>One critical aspect of the published works is the blinding and concealment of treatment and outcome assessors.

<bold>Paper</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Recommend describing the goal of the study as to &#x0201c;evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of group ANC (G-ANC)
<underline>delivered by HEWs</underline> at the health post level, compared to usual ANC &#x02026;&#x0201d; since the intervention being tested here is whether HEW can deliver G-ANC.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>
<bold>Design</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The description of the design needs to be clearer. For example, the abstract indicates that 6 health centers, each with 6 health posts under them, will be randomized in a stepped wedge design to the intervention. However, the methods indicates only 3 (?) health posts per cluster will be included.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The design is clustered at the health center level, so there are 6 clusters, but Figure 1 in the Methods lists 12 clusters, which is confusing.

<bold>Intervention</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>What is the rationale for the following &#x0201c;Up to two additional pregnant women who meet study criteria can be added to a G-ANC cohort if added to the cohort by the second G-ANC meeting&#x0201d;?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How will women who develop complications, and may be referred to the health center level, be accounted for or handled?</p></list-item><list-item><p>If G-ANC is going to be delivered at the &#x0201c;health posts that offer integrated point-of-care testing (POCT) to screen for anemia, syphilis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB)&#x0201d; then this needs to be part of the inclusion criteria for selecting eligible health posts.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>NB: Table 1 lists POCT as an inclusion criteria for health centers but not health posts, which doesn&#x02019;t align with the text</p></list-item><list-item><p>Exclusion criteria for pregnant women around conditions that may complicate study interpretation or objectives needs to be more specific as to what would meet this criteria (high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, obesity, mental health issues?)</p></list-item></list>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ahh, I see some information on inclusion/exclusion is in Table 1. This needs to be aligned with the text to either more clearly reference this table or to clarify the inclusion/exclusion criteria being used
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A point of clarification &#x02013; health centers have inclusion criteria because they are the unit of randomization, but all participants will be enrolled at the health post level (i.e. no one will be enrolled at the health center) &#x02013; is that correct?</p></list-item></list>

<bold>Statistical analysis</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Please be explicit about which time periods will be compared when estimating primary outcomes &#x02013; for example is T1 included for health centers not randomized to the intervention until T3? Are comparisons only being made within a given time period or across time periods for intervention and control conditions?
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>For example &#x02013; are the proportions in Table 4 suggest a pre-post design; is the expectation that health centers who receive the intervention in T2 would be compared to their T1, rather than intervention and control compared at T2? Please clarify</p></list-item></list>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>Outcome definitions need to be more specific &#x02013; i.e. The proportion of women with at least 4 ANC visits by time period? By intervention vs control? And how will satisfaction with ANC be measured?</p></list-item><list-item><p>In addition, some discussion around how the pause and reflect sessions will be used to adjust intervention content and if and how that will be handled at the analysis phase is needed. If comparisons are only planned by intervention and control groups within a given time period (which needs clarification) then this may not be an issue. But if there is interest in analyzing all intervention period together and there are major changes to the intervention during the pause and reflect period, this would not be appropriate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It&#x02019;s not clear in the design that randomization is stratified by location and client volume &#x02013; please clarify this in the design and discuss in the statistical approach if and how this will be taken into account.</p></list-item></list>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study timeline of 18 months stated in the text doesn&#x02019;t align with Figure 2, which lists a 3-4 month pilot, pause and reflect period and 6 months for each of the T1-T3 time periods</p></list-item><list-item><p>More information on the types of data collected at the baseline and endline survey is needed &#x02013; is only sociodemographic information included?

<bold>Introduction</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors need to review data and research on ANC client flow/case load at the health post level and analyze what that means regarding the feasibility of G-ANC at the health post level. Will health posts in Ethiopia have enough number of ANC clients to implement G-ANC?</p></list-item><list-item><p>The possible causes of losses to the maternal health care continuum of care in Ethiopia and the plausibility of the hypothesis that G-ANC will improve retention is not adequately presented in the introduction section.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Some of the contents presented in the introduction section need a government document as a reference.

<bold>Study Design</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The paper provided a clear description of the stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial. However, they also added a section that describes piloting in 5 health posts to determine feasibility. As the authors have already determined feasibility, I suggest taking all the information about feasibility (including how feasibility was assessed and their findings) to the introduction section.</p></list-item></list>
<bold>Study Setting</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>If the authors are intending to continue the study even with the current security challenges, the security situation should be clearly described here.</p></list-item></list>
<bold>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Currently, health posts in Ethiopia are classified in to two categories &#x02013; basic and comprehensive. Even though the health posts are not yet fully restructured into these two new categories, it is important that the authors mention which categories of health posts are included in their study.</p></list-item></list>
<bold>Intervention</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>How similar/different are contents of the G-ANC meetings with that of standard ANC sessions? Table 2 will be more informative if it is revised to include this information instead of presenting just the contents of the G-ANC sessions.</p></list-item></list>

These mostly address my previous review feedback but I would recommend some additional minor amendments as follows:</p><p> Abstract &#x02013; suggest you change &#x02018;facility-based delivery&#x02019; to &#x02018;birth with a skilled birth attendant&#x02019; as this has a better fit with the evidence. The text can explain that in the Ethiopian context this implies facility-based birth but for consistency of language in the abstract you could say something like: &#x02018;In Ethiopia skilled birth attendance is only available in health facilities&#x02019;, therefore&#x02026;.</p><p> (this then helps to make clear why you have focused on facility births)</p><p> You have clarified the role and scope of health centres and health posts and who works in each but it would also be helpful to clarify whether health posts provide any birth care or just antenatal (I assume just anc but it is not explicit). Also, it remains unclear whether the comparison/control group care is also delivered in the same setting by the same people (HEWs) with the only difference being that it is individual.</p><p> Under randomisation &#x02013; please spell out the acronym POCT as I don&#x02019;t think was used before.</p><p> A few additional points to consider re data:</p><p> Qualitative data &#x02013; you have specified the software to be used but not the approach &#x02013; will this be thematic? Also an you outline who will be included in qualitative data collection and the specific methods you plan to use?</p><p> Questionnaires &#x02013; for assessing empowerment you might want to consider using the PRES scale (developed by Klima&#x000a0;et al., 2015) [Ref 1] as this is being used in some other group care studies and this would facilitate comparison of experiences across different settings and studies.</p><p>Is the study design appropriate for the research question?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Is the rationale for, and objectives of, the study clearly described?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are sufficient details of the methods provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>maternal and infant health; complex interventions</p><p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="rep-ref-38261-1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">

This is a common target, but it isn&#x02019;t a direct indicator of outcomes and may be mediated by birth attendant &#x02013; in many LMIC settings, and indeed high-income countries, giving birth outside a &#x02018;facility&#x02019; means without skilled birth attendance. It is entirely plausible that the key issue is skilled birth attendance. We know that birth outwith hospitals in high income settings with integrated care systems and attendance by a qualified midwife is very safe. The safety implications may of course vary by geographical (e.g. difficulty of transfer to hospital in the event of complications/lack of transport) as well as health system context (qualified midwives available to attend birth at home and fully integrated in the care system, risk assessment, referral systems for those with risk factors), but this is something to bear in mind in your study.</p><p> Introduction</p><p> There is a good brief explanation of health extension workers but no explanation of what is meant by health professionals &#x02013; stated as HPs &#x02013; it would be helpful to explain which cadre of HP staff health centres. The relationship between the HEWs and HPs would also benefit from more clarification &#x02013; currently it just says 2 assigned to 1- can you explain a little more how this works? Who are they assigned to &#x02013; a midwife? Do the HPs visit the health posts or are only based at health centres?</p><p> The intervention is explained well given the conciseness and the testing of the model as facilitated in health posts by HEWs was clear but the control care was not made clear &#x02013; will control group women receive individual visits at health posts with HEWs? Or will this be different in some other way? (Table 1 does help with this but I still think it could be made more explicit in the text what the control group care is.)</p><p> In methods, likewise, the schedule of care in the intervention group is explained well but there is a lack of information about control/standard care &#x02013; do they receive the same number and intervals of anc visits? How long are the individual visits? Is the testing kit being used in both intervention and control groups?</p><p> The training for the HEWs is explained briefly and the midwives who will mentor them will be given mentorship training, but will these midwives also have had the group-care facilitation training or any practice with these so they understand the way the approach works?</p><p> The guide for visits seems heavily focused on understanding risks, which is obviously important, but will the visit plans not include health promotional content such as healthy eating and self-care? (Actually table 3 suggests it will be this isn&#x02019;t clear from the text.</p><p> Methods</p><p> It would be helpful to provide a brief overview of what the pilot study will involve &#x02013; this is mentioned (and is a good idea to do) but with no information about what it will involve, for how long. Etc. There is some information further down, but this gives the numbers but no detail about methods involved &#x02013; for example will HEWs and midwives be interviewed to understand their experience, women involved? Any observation of pilot groups?</p><p> The Step Wedge Cluster trial design is appropriate and described well.</p><p> Outcome measures &#x02013; as mentioned above use of facility-based birth as a primary outcome is understandable given it is a key national / international target but it is a proxy outcome. You haven&#x02019;t included any direct clinical outcomes in your analysis plan &#x02013; what about gestational age or birthweight or a composite healthy baby and/or healthy mother outcome?</p><p> How will empowerment, self-efficacy and satisfaction be assessed? Are you planning to use validated or established tools for these during the interviews with women? If so, which ones?</p><p> If not, how will you approach this?</p><p>Is the study design appropriate for the research question?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Is the rationale for, and objectives of, the study clearly described?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are sufficient details of the methods provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>maternal and infant health; complex interventions</p><p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
