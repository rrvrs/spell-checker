Hormonal fluctuations, coupled with the adaptation to maternal roles, play a pivotal role in postpartum depression and anxiety. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of home and telephone supportive counseling on postpartum depression and anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 93 primiparous women aged 18&#x02013;45 years attended the Taleghani and Al-Zahra educational and medical centers in Tabriz, Iran. Subjects were randomly assigned to the home supportive counseling, telephone supportive counseling, and control (receiving routine postpartum care) groups. Home and telephone supportive counseling were conducted for three 30&#x02013;45&#x000a0;min sessions scheduled on postpartum days 3&#x02013;5, 7&#x02013;9, and 20&#x02013;25. Data were collected using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale 10&#x02013;15 days and 42&#x02013;60 days postpartum, and analyzed using ANCOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The mean (SD) depression score was 6.23 (3.09) in the telephone supportive counseling group, 4.78 (3.85) in the home supportive counseling group, and 5.79 (3.39) in the control group during 10&#x02013;15 days postpartum (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.016). The mean (SD) anxiety score was 28.11 (9.37) in the telephone supportive counseling group, 27.32 (7.38) in the home supportive counseling group, and 39.88 (7.73) in the control group during 10&#x02013;15 days postpartum (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

Moreover, both home and telephone supportive counseling were found to reduce postpartum anxiety symptoms within 10&#x02013;15 days postpartum. Considering the cost-effectiveness of phone counseling, it is recommended that healthcare providers use telephone supportive counseling to reduce early postpartum anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Registration clinical trials</title><p id="Par5">Iranian Registery of Clinical Trials-Beta vertion, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://irct.behdasht.gov.ir/trial/71775">https://irct.behdasht.gov.ir/trial/71775</ext-link> (IRCT20170506033834N11), registered 2023.8.20.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Supportive counseling</kwd><kwd>Postpartum depression</kwd><kwd>Postpartum anxiety</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">The postpartum period represents a critical phase in the lives of mothers and their newborns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization defines this period as the interval from immediately after delivery to six weeks (42 days) postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Childbirth and the postpartum experience often lead to the significant physiological and emotional changes for mothers, especially primiparous mothers without prior experience, as adjusting to the maternal role and accepting the responsibility of newborn care can be challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These difficulties may contribute to mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression in postpartum women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Approximately 10% of women experience depression during the first year postpartum, and nearly 20&#x02013;40% of mothers suffer from mood disorders after childbirth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Postpartum depression is the most common psychological disorder during the postpartum, occurring at any time within the first year after birth. The risk of postpartum depression in the near miss mothers are even twice as likely as women with normal childbirth experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Studies indicated that adequate support can reduce the risk of postpartum anxiety and depression while enhancing mothers&#x02019; self-esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Maternal depression and anxiety increase the risk of adverse outcomes in infant feeding such as delayed initiation of breastfeeding and lack of breastfeeding continuity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In Iran, mothers are typically discharged from the hospital shortly after childbirth, and spend the initial days and weeks of motherhood at home without the close support of healthcare providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this regard, appropriate psychological support and supportive counseling, especially for primiparous mothers, seem essential. Supportive counseling aids individuals in organizing distressing emotional states, strengthening, and developing coping strategies. It emphasizes exploring the experiences, reactions, and emotions of clients, with a primary focus on self-esteem, ego functionality, and adaptability skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This counseling approach does not rely on a cohesive theory; rather, it is a set of techniques applied within any theoretical framework. This counseling approach is primarily focused on clarification and emotional catharsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">A systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] assessed the effect of various home interventions on maternal and neonatal outcomes and found that the quality of evidence was low, and further well-designed trials were recommended to develop an optimal care package. Home support interventions can shift care towards a client-centered approach. Because home counseling increases costs, telephone consultation is considered as an effective means for providing consultation and facilitating access to care. The importance of telephone health counseling was highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lavender et al. conducted a review study on 12,256 women and reported ambiguous and inconclusive results regarding the effect of telephone support on postpartum anxiety, as data were collected at different time intervals using various assessment tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Considering the critical role of postpartum support, and the lack of comparative studies on telephone versus home counseling during postpartum, this study aimed to compare the effect of the telephone and home supportive counseling on postpartum depression and anxiety.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par10">This randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted on 93 primiparous women delivered vaginally at Taleghani and Al-Zahra Educational and Medical Centers in Tabriz, Iran.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], is employed to measure depression during pregnancy and postpartum. The scale consists of ten four-option questions, ranked in ascending severity for some items (1, 2, and 4) and descending severity for others (3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). Each response is scored on a scale of 0&#x02013;3, reflecting the severity of symptoms, and the total score, ranging from 0 to 30, is calculated by summing the scores of all items. The validity of this scale was evaluated 0.78 through concurrent correlation coefficient of EPDS and the Beck Depression Inventory. The reliability of the EPDS was estimated to be 0.75 using Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha and the split-half method. Montazeri et al.

Due to the large number of items, a shorter version was later developed and psychometrically validated and this study utilized the 16-item version. The PSAS-RSF is the first validated short form for assessing postpartum-specific anxiety, which can be used up to 12 months postpartum. Each subdomain includes four items, with response options ranging from &#x0201c;never&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;almost always,&#x0201d; scored from one to four, respectively and the total score range from 16 to 64 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par30">This is the first study worldwide examined the impact of home supportive counseling and telephone supportive counseling on postpartum depression and anxiety. The results revealed that home supportive counseling significantly reduced postpartum depression compared to the telephone support counseling and control groups during 10&#x02013;15 days postpartum. However, no statistically significant difference in postpartum depression scores was observed among the three groups during 42&#x02013;60 days postpartum.</p><p id="Par31">The results of this study are consistent with the results of prior research demonstrating the ineffectiveness of interventions for postpartum depression during 2&#x02013;3 months postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Inconsistent with the results of present study, Milani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] conducted a RCT on 276 postpartum women in Tehran, Iran and found a significant improvement in depression level of the intervention group compared to the control group after receiving home care for two months. This discrepancy can be attributed to the difference in the intervention type (home-care package) applied in the study of Milani et al. compared to the home support counseling employed in the present study.</p><p id="Par33">Further, Vismara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] examined the impact of the reflective parenting home visiting program on 77 primiparous mothers with healthy infants in Italy and revealed a significant decrease in depression levels among mothers in the intervention group compared to those in control group during 3- to 12-month postpartum, which is not in line with the results of the present study. The difference in the results may be due to the difference in the content and approach of the intervention used in Vismara et al.&#x02018;s study.</p><p id="Par34">In another study, Dennis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] evaluated the effectiveness of peer telephone support to prevent postnatal depression on 701 women at high risk for depression in Canada and reported a 64% reduction in the relative risk of depression during 12-week postpartum, which is not consistent with the results of present study. This discrepancy can be attributed to population and the nature of the intervention (peer support), which was delivered by a community-recruited volunteer who had previously experienced and recovered from postpartum depression and had participated in a 4-hour training session.</p><p id="Par35">Contrary to the results of the present study, Chyzzy and Cindy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] assessed the impact of peer telephone support on postpartum depression among pregnant adolescents aged 16&#x02013;24 in Toronto. The results demonstrated that adolescents in the intervention group, who received peer support from a trained peer mentor through mobile communication (calls or text messages) during their third trimester and 12 weeks postpartum, had significantly lower depression scores at 12-week postpartum compared to the control group. The difference may be explained by variations in the target population and the type of intervention (peer support).</p><p id="Par36">The results of this study indicated that both home supportive counseling and telephone supportive counseling led to a reduction in postpartum anxiety compared to the control group during 10&#x02013;15 days postpartum. However, no statistically significant difference in postpartum anxiety score was observed among these groups during 42&#x02013;60 days postpartum.</p><p id="Par37">Consistent with the findings of this study, Simhi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] demonstrated that the WAWA (What Am I Worried About? ) intervention, accompanied by a self-help workbook addressing common anxieties experienced by new mothers and incorporating cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness techniques, significantly reduced postpartum anxiety and stress scores after the intervention. The subjects opted the telephone support reported a more substantial reduction in anxiety and stress scores compared to those selected group intervention.</p><p id="Par38">In addition, Ko&#x000e7;ak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] in their study sought to design a mobile support application to assist postpartum mothers and evaluate its effects on maternal anxiety level. They concluded that although the postpartum mobile support application provided a valuable and reliable source of information, it was not effective in reducing anxiety during the six-week postpartum evaluation, which is in line with the findings of present study.</p><p id="Par39">In a systematic review, Lavender et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] evaluated the impact of telephone support during pregnancy and the first six-week postpartum on maternal and neonatal outcomes. The review included data from 27 RCTs involving 12,256 women. There was no strong evidence to confirm a reduction in maternal anxiety during pregnancy or postpartum following telephone support. The interpretation of the results regarding postpartum anxiety was unclear, as the data were collected at different time points using various instruments.</p><p id="Par40">Since there was no significant difference between the home and telephone supportive counseling groups in anxiety mean score and considering the cost-effectiveness of phone counseling to in-home one, it is recommended that health care providers utilize telephone supportive counseling to reduce early postpartum anxiety.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par41">One of the notable strengths of this study was the random allocation of participants to groups and allocation concealment to eliminate the selection bias, whereas limitations included the lack of blinding of participants due to the nature of the study and reliance on self-reported data. Moreover, the study was conducted in a single geographical region. The small sample size was another limitation of the present study. In addition, this study was conducted on primigravida women, and the results cannot be generalized to multiparous women.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">Supportive counseling provided at home appears to be effective in alleviating symptoms of postpartum depression within the first two weeks after delivery. Evidence indicates that both in-home and telephone-based counseling approaches can help decrease anxiety levels during this early postpartum period. Due to its affordability and practicality, telephone counseling emerges as a viable strategy for addressing early postpartum anxiety. In addition, further efforts should focus on implementing mental health support programs with a long-term perspective, and future research should explore these interventions specifically in women who have undergone cesarean delivery to enable comparison of results.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was derived from MSc thesis registered at Tabriz University of Medical sciences with ID: IR.TBZMED.REC.1402.354.
