In 2005, we started using nafamostat mesilate and low-dose heparin as anticoagulants during cardiopulmonary bypass for early surgery. The outcomes of this strategy have been reviewed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">All patients who underwent cardiac surgery for active infective endocarditis with intracranial hemorrhage between 2005 and 2023 were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">There were 23 consecutive patients (median age 62 years old). Ten patients (43%) had neurologic deficits. The indication for early surgery in most patients was the presence of mobile vegetation or existing embolic events (18 of 23, 78%). No complications were associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. The median interval between the diagnosis and surgery was two days. There was 1 early death (4%) due to sepsis. There was no exacerbation of intracranial hemorrhage. One patient had new ectopic microbleeds without deterioration of neurologic findings. One patient had a new-onset cerebral infarction with neurologic deficits. None of the patients exhibited neurologic deterioration.

Intracranial hemorrhage is the most serious complication, as high-dose systemic anticoagulation during cardiac surgery can exacerbate bleeding and lead to increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">A multicenter cohort study demonstrated that early surgery for patients with intracranial hemorrhage may cause new bleeding, neurologic deterioration, and a poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Based on this, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology 2017 Guidelines recommend delayed surgery, defined as at least 4&#x000a0;weeks, for patients with major ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, some patients occasionally require early surgery due to progressive heart failure, uncontrolled infection, or recurrent embolic events.</p><p id="Par7">To solve this dilemma and accomplish early surgery for patients with intracranial hemorrhage while minimizing the risk of further bleeding, we have used nafamostat mesilate (NM; 6-amino-2 naphthalene-p-guanidinobenzoate dimethanesulfonate) and low-dose heparin as anticoagulants during cardiopulmonary bypass since 2005, as our group has reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our group demonstrated the usefulness of NM with its very short half-life and ability to inactivate coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet aggregation.</p><p id="Par8">Previous studies have reported the outcomes of this innovative strategy in patients with acute stroke, which were not limited to cases with intracranial hemorrhage. In the present study, we reviewed our strategy and experience, focusing specifically on the most challenging patients with IE complicated by intracranial hemorrhage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Indication for surgical timing</title><p id="Par9">In cases of intracranial hemorrhage, our ideal policy is to pursue non-surgical management for approximately one month if possible. However, in a practical clinical setting, if there is uncontrolled infection, heart failure, or a high risk of recurrent embolization, and there is no severely decreased level of consciousness, we take an aggressive approach to early surgery, regardless of the amount of bleeding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par10">This retrospective study evaluated all patients with active IE and intracranial hemorrhage who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass using low-dose heparin and NM at Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine between June 2005 and February 2023. Intracranial hemorrhage includes a spectrum of diseases, ranging from incidental microbleeds, ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and parenchymal hemorrhage to more significant lesions. All patients were diagnosed with active IE according to the modified Duke criteria.</p><p id="Par11">Intracranial hemorrhage was detected using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) preoperatively. At the same time, patients were also assessed for the presence of a cerebral aneurysm using magnetic resonance angiography or CT angiography. If it was considered the cause of the hemorrhage or if the risk of rupture was considered high, intervention of the aneurysm was performed by a neurosurgeon, with the intervention method determined by the neurosurgeon.</p><p id="Par12">Postoperative imaging tests were performed within a day after cardiac surgery to monitor any worsening neurologic findings in all patients. Medical records were reviewed, and follow-up was performed by reviewing outpatient charts or by contacting the referring physicians.</p><p id="Par13">The institutional ethics committee approved the anonymous use of patient data (approval 2022-0098; approved on November 9, 2021), and the need for individual consent was waived.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Anticoagulation protocol during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)</title><p id="Par14">In 2005, we started using nafamostat mesylate was used as an anticoagulant during CPB in patients with active IE complicated by cerebral complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Before cannulation for CPB, 100 IU/kg of heparin (a third of the normal dosage) was administered to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT; measured by a Hemochron<sup>TM</sup>; Accriva Diagnostics, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) of over 200&#x000a0;s. After this was accomplished, cannulae were inserted. If the ACT did not increase beyond 400&#x000a0;s, 20&#x000a0;mg of NM or 500&#x02013;1000 IU of heparin was administered.</p><p id="Par15">The pump circuit was composed of a centrifugal pump, silicon- and heparin-coated hollow-fiber polypropylene oxygenator, and heparin-coated bypass circuit (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). After connecting to the circuit, the NM was infused continuously through the venous line of the pump circuit at 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/h. The ACT was maintained at 300&#x02013;600&#x000a0;s by a fine titration of the NM dose every 15&#x000a0;min, which was also added at a constant rate (0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg/h) to the cardiotomy reservoir. The NM dose to the venous reservoir was adjusted to maintain the ACT at its optimal level. There was no upper limit for the NM dose. An additional bolus injection of heparin was administered if the ACT decreased to &#x0003c;200&#x000a0;s or in the presence of visible viscosity of the blood collected in the pericardial cavity. the patient&#x02019;s core temperature was reduced to 33&#x000a0;&#x02103;, and the target mean systemic pressure was 50&#x000a0;mmHg.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schema of the pump circuit.

A randomized trial demonstrated that early surgery significantly reduced the risk of death and embolic events compared with conventional therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, in patients with intracranial hemorrhage, early surgery has been reported to result in an increased incidence of in-hospital death related to new severe bleeding after cardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Indeed, a multicenter observational study reported that patients with intracranial hemorrhage who underwent surgery within 4&#x000a0;weeks of a hemorrhagic event had a higher mortality than those who underwent surgery after more than 4&#x000a0;weeks (75% versus 40%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The percentage of new bleeds postoperatively was reported to be 50% in surgeries performed in the first 2&#x000a0;weeks after the neurologic event.</p><p id="Par31">Based on these findings, the American Association for Thoracic Surgery consensus guidelines recommend delaying surgery for 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;weeks in patients with non-hemorrhagic stroke and for 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks in patients with hemorrhagic stroke to reduce the risk of further intracranial bleeding during heart surgery (Class IIa recommendation, level of evidence B). The 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines corroborate this recommendation (Class IIb recommendation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">However, these recommendations are not always applicable to all patients. The timing of surgery should be individualized and determined by weighing the need for surgery against the risk of additional emboli during the waiting period or provoking intracranial hemorrhage during the operation. According to the European Society of Cardiology 2023 guidelines for the management of IE, urgent or emergency surgery should be considered in patients with ICH and unstable clinical status due to heart failure, uncontrolled infection, or persistent high embolic risk, weighing the likelihood of a meaningful neurologic outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. We believe that if new bleeding can be controlled in patients with intracranial hemorrhage, more patients could benefit from early surgery.</p><p id="Par33">In the present study, 87% of patients underwent surgery within 7&#x000a0;days of the diagnosis with IE and intracranial hemorrhage. Although 4% of the patients had new ectopic microbleeds, none of the patients experienced exacerbation of bleeding or worsening neurologic findings as a result. Few reports have analyzed patients with intracranial hemorrhage who underwent surgery for IE, especially when surgery was performed early. The reported rates of in-hospital mortality in these patients range from 4 to 75% with either early or late interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Causes of mortality included deaths related to new bleeding events. The mortality rate in the present study was lower than that in previous studies, despite early surgery being performed, perhaps because of the suppression of deaths related to the exacerbation of hemorrhage. An additional reason is that 35% of the patients in this series had microbleeds preoperatively. Sorabella et al. reported that, in patients with microbleeds, early surgical intervention did not lead to significantly worse postoperative outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Several cases of early surgery in patients with large hemorrhagic lesions have been reported to carry a higher risk of exacerbation. However, bleeding was not exacerbated in present study. Therefore, we believe that our strategy is safe and effective and should be considered the treatment of choice for patients with intracranial hemorrhage. Nevertheless, further studies are required to investigate the surgical outcomes in patients with large hemorrhagic lesions.</p><p id="Par34">Nafamostat mesilate is a synthetic low-molecular-weight serine protease inhibitor with a very short half-life that inhibits coagulation and platelet aggregation by deactivating the action of plasmin, thrombin, and activated coagulation factors as well as interfering with fibrinolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the case of high-risk bleeding, nafamostat mesilate has been used as an alternative anticoagulant to heparin in mechanical circulatory support devices and hemodialysis, as it acts as a regional anticoagulant in extracorporeal circuits. Murase et al. proved that the use of nafamostat mesilate during CPB reduced postoperative blood loss without loss of platelet count or function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As their analysis focused on elective CABG patients, the CPB duration was relatively short. In our series, a gradual decrease in the platelet count was observed during CPB, particularly after 4&#x000a0;h. Therefore, we believe that caution is needed for the potential worsening of bleeding in surgeries that require CPB for over 4 h to complete. Fortunately, none of the patients in this study required re-exploration for postoperative bleeding, although there were cases with relatively long CPB times.</p><p id="Par35">Regarding the monitoring of anticoagulation, it has been reported that both ACT and activated partial thromboplastin time are often used in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, ACT has been used for anticoagulation monitoring because of the need for frequent measurements and fine-tuning of anticoagulant dosing. Whether or not the effects of nafamostat mesilate can be determined solely by monitoring ACT is controversial. During surgery, it is crucial to closely communicate with the perfusionist to assess the actual blood viscosity in the surgical field and adjust the nafamostat mesilate dosage accordingly in relation to the ACT values. In the present study, there were no problems with the CPB circuit, including cases of abnormally high pressure in the preoxygenator. Unfortunately, one patient experienced cerebral infarction postoperatively, the cause of which could not be determined. In addition, there is a future prospect of considering the use of thromboelastography to monitor the anticoagulant effects of NM.</p><p id="Par36">Our group previously reported the results of early surgery in patients with acute stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Without changing our strategy from previous studies, we focused on cases of intracranial hemorrhage alone in the present study, which requires the most difficult decisions. In addition, cases with longer CPB times were included, including those requiring extensive debridement and reconstruction, such as the Commando procedure. As CPB time increases, there is a concern that the risk of exacerbated intracranial bleeding may increase due to platelet consumption, impaired platelet function, and excessive fibrinolysis. However, even with the inclusion of very high-risk cases, none of the patients showed worsening neurologic findings. These results also demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this strategy using nafamostat mesilate.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par37">The study design has limitations inherent to a single-center retrospective follow-up study that enrolled a small number of patients. We had a small number of patients, and approximately 30% were followed up for longer than 5&#x000a0;years. Because the hemorrhagic lesion in approximately half of the cases was &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;mm in size, this strategy is not considered applicable to all patients with intracranial hemorrhage. Since the routine imaging test in the postoperative acute phase was performed with CT, it is possible to underestimate cerebral events. Furthermore, it is possible that some patients with severe cerebral hemorrhage were either not referred by cardiologists or emergency physicians or that their families declined cardiac surgery during the study period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par38">Early surgery using NM in patients with active IE and intracranial hemorrhage can be performed without hemorrhage exacerbation in unavoidable instances.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>None.</p></ack><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>Open Access funding provided by Kobe University.</p></notes><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar1" notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par39">The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></notes></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation-alternatives><element-citation id="ec-CR1" publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pettersson</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name><name><surname>Coselli</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Hussain</surname><given-names>ST</given-names></name><name><surname>Griffin</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Blackstone</surname><given-names>EH</given-names></name><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>2016 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) consensus guidelines: surgical treatment of infective endocarditis: executive summary</article-title><source>J Thorac Caridiothorac Surg.</source><year>2017</year><volume>153</volume><fpage>1241</fpage><lpage>1258</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.jtcvs.2016.09.093</pub-id></element-citation><mixed-citation id="mc-CR1" publication-type="journal">Pettersson GB, Coselli JS, Hussain ST, Griffin B, Blackstone EH, Gordon SM, et al. 2016 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) consensus guidelines: surgical treatment of infective endocarditis: executive summary.
