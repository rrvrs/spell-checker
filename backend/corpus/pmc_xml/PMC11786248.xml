Remarkably, even limited periods of sleep deprivation (SD) can adversely affect cognitive functions such as memory retention, emotional regulation, data processing, and concentration. The Rose of Jericho (RoJ) has been considered more than a plant and has demonstrated potential therapeutic actions in childbirth, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, and cancer.&#x000a0;The effect of the RoJ on memory, cognition, and behavior has not yet been well-studied.</p><p>Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the possible therapeutic effects of the RoJ on memory, cognition, behavior, and motor coordination in a rat model of SD.</p><p>Materials and methods: Thirty male Wistar albino rats weighing 120-150 g were used in the present study. The rats were acclimatized and trained and then randomly divided into three groups: control (C), sleep-deprived (SD), and SD treated with RoJ (SD+RoJ). Spatial memory and learning were assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test, while anxiety-related behaviors were evaluated through the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) test. The rotarod test was used to assess motor coordination.</p><p>Results: The study revealed significant behavioral and cognitive performance improvements with the SD+RoJ group across all the tests. In the MWM test, the SD group exhibited a marked increase in test duration (29.5 &#x000b1; 3.57 sec) and a reduction in average speed (1.9 &#x000b1; 0.3 cm/s) when compared to the C group (13.41 &#x000b1; 1.57 sec and 5.9 &#x000b1; 0.34 cm/s, respectively). Interestingly, the SD+RoJ group significantly reduced test duration (19.75 &#x000b1; 3.36 sec) and improved rats&#x02019; speed (6.06 &#x000b1; 0.27 cm/s) compared to the SD group. The EPM test demonstrated that the SD group spent significantly less time in the open arms (16.2 &#x000b1; 9.44 sec) than the C group (59.8 &#x000b1; 3.29 sec). Interestingly, the SD+RoJ group significantly improved the time spent in the open arms (45.8 &#x000b1; 11.64 sec). Moreover, the SD+RoJ group showed notable improvement in open-arm entries (7 &#x000b1; 2.39) compared to the SD group (1.6 &#x000b1; 0.81). In the Rotarod test, the SD group demonstrated a significant decline in latency to fall (44.2 &#x000b1; 9.5 sec) compared to the C group (228.67 &#x000b1; 35.44 sec). The SD+RoJ group exhibited a significantly longer falling latency (165 &#x000b1; 28.77 sec) than the SD group.</p><p>Conclusion: Treatment with the RoJ alleviated SD-dependent cognitive impairment, anxiety, and decline in motor coordination. Supplementation with the RoJ may offer potential therapeutic benefits, including boosting memory, improving cognition, reducing anxiety and depression, and&#x000a0;enhancing motor coordination.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>cognition</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>rose of jericho</kwd><kwd>sleep deprivation</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep is a complex interplay of multiple physiological processes predominantly governed by neurobiological mechanisms [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These mechanisms are evident at genetic, biological, and cellular organizational levels. Several brain areas regulate sleep, including the basal forebrain, thalamus, and hypothalamus. Serotonin, norepinephrine, histamine, orexin, acetylcholine, dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid control sleep neurobiological mechanisms [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Sleep is governed by a finely tuned interplay of quantitative and qualitative parameters. Disruption of these regulatory mechanisms can precipitate sleep deprivation (SD). This condition has become increasingly prevalent across all age groups and diverse populations in the context of modern, high-pressure lifestyles [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The etiology of SD involves interrelated medical, psychosocial, and occupational stressors, which contribute to its global impact on public health [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. SD has profound effects on health, contributing to various physiological and psychological disorders, including an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes, and weakened immune function [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among medical students, SD is a critical concern, often stemming from academic pressures, social commitments, and increased screen time, leading to decreased cognitive functions, emotional instability, and heightened stress levels [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, SD significantly impacts healthcare professionals, with approximately 50% of physicians reporting inadequate sleep, which contributes to a 30% increase in medical errors and a 20% decrease in patient satisfaction, underscoring the need to address SD to improve both staff well-being and patient care quality [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Herbal medicine has long been a cornerstone of traditional healthcare across diverse cultures and regions, with its use passed down through generations [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Among these, <italic>Anastatica hierochuntica</italic> (Rose of Jericho (RoJ), resurrection plant,&#x000a0;Genggam Fatimah, Kaf Mariam) stands out due to its rich composition of bioactive compounds, including chlorogenic acid, quercetin, luteolin, and kaempferol. These compounds possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, offering significant therapeutic potential for treating conditions such as oxidative stress, hyperuricemia, gout, and renal impairment due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, in various regions, RoJ has been traditionally used for wound healing, immune system support, and treating reproductive system-related disorders [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Its medicinal value continues to gain attention in modern medical research.</p><p>There is growing interest in identifying natural interventions that can mitigate the detrimental effects of sleep deficiency on cognitive performance and oxidative balance. Little is known about the neuroprotective&#x000a0;effects of RoJ.&#x000a0;The present study investigated the potential therapeutic effects of RoJ in counteracting SD-dependent memory impairment and behavioral changes&#x000a0;in experimental animals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Ethical considerations</p><p>This research was conducted in accordance with the regulations and guidelines set forth by the Research and Ethics Committee of Arabian Gulf University (approval number: E23-PI-1-23), as well as the Guiding Principles for the Use and Care of Animals [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. All personnel involved in the laboratory procedures were trained and certified in handling laboratory animals. At the end of the experiment, all rats were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation.</p><p>Experimental settings and animals</p><p>This study was performed between September 01, 2023, and June 30, 2024, at the Animal House Unit of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Arabian Gulf University, Kingdom of Bahrain. Thirty male Wistar albino rats weighing 150-200 g were allowed to acclimatize for 10 days and were fed standard laboratory chow ad libitum. Rats were also given free access to water in an air-conditioned room with a 12-hour light/dark cycle.</p><p>Study groups</p><p>Rats were randomly and equally assigned to three experimental groups as follows: control (C) group (rats were housed in their cages with normal sleep cycles and unrestricted access to food and water), sleep deprivation (SD) group (rats underwent 72 hours of paradoxical SD and received a daily morning single dose of 1 ml distilled water via gastric lavage), and SD RoJ-treated (SD+RoJ) group (rats were subjected to 72 hours of paradoxical SD with concomitant administration of&#x000a0;RoJ&#x000a0;in a daily morning single dose of 250 mg/kg (1 ml) via gastric lavage (5% extract, Dreams Oil presses, Jeddah, SA) [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Induction of sleep deprivation</p><p>SD was induced as described previously [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The rats were housed in a specially designed glass tank (120 x 40 x 40 cm) with 10 platforms. The platforms were designed to enable the rats to remain alert and stand comfortably while preventing them from falling asleep. If the rats were to fall asleep, they would fall in the water and wake up. Consequently, the rats can only move by jumping between the&#x000a0;platforms. Rats were placed in the empty glass tank before filling it with water for one hour/day for three days prior to the start of the experiment to allow proper acclimatization. Ultimately, the tank was filled with water 3 cm below the surface of the platforms.</p><p>Blinding of outcome assessors</p><p>Blinding of assessors was maintained&#x000a0;to minimize bias and maximize the validity of the study results. All possible measures to minimize stress before/during induction of SD or outcome assessments were taken.</p><p>Assessment of spatial memory and learning</p><p>Spatial memory and learning were assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM)&#x000a0;test as previously described [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, rats were placed in an opaque pool and were required to swim to a hidden escape platform. Following a five-day training program (after the acclimatization period and before the SD period), rats became more familiar with the test, and both their traveled distance and speed in finding the&#x000a0;hidden platform improved. The following metrics were recorded: total test duration (sec), average speed (cm/sec), and total traveled distance (cm).</p><p>Assessment of anxiety-related behavior</p><p>Anxiety-related behavior was assessed using the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) test as described previously [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In brief, the EPM configuration provides two open and two closed arms arranged in a cross shape. The ratio of the time spent in the open arms (sec) and the time spent in the closed arms (sec), as well as the number of entries into the open arms, were considered as a reflection of the rats&#x02019; anxiety-related behavior. Rats were trained for five consecutive days following the acclimatization period and prior to performing the recorded experiment.</p><p>Assessment of motor function and coordination</p><p>Motor function and coordination were assessed with the rotarod test [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The rotarod evaluates motor function and coordination by examining neural centers like the cerebellum and sensorimotor cortex. Rats were placed on a rotating rod that increased speed. The latency (time until rats fall off) was measured to assess the impact of stress on motor coordination.</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>Origin Pro 2023 software (OriginLab Corporation, MA, USA) was used to analyze the data generated from the MWM, EPM, and rotarod tests. All data were checked for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey&#x02019;s post-hoc tests was performed. The one-way ANOVA model had the following assumptions: independence, normality, and homogeneity. Confidence level was 95%. Results are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean. P-values of 0.05 or lower were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>MWM test results</p><p>The MWM results demonstrated that SD significantly increased test duration (29.51 &#x000b1; 3.57 sec) and decreased average speed (1.91 &#x000b1; 0.3 sec) compared to corresponding values in the C group (13.41 &#x000b1; 1.57 sec and 5.93 &#x000b1; 0.34 sec, respectively). The SD+RoJ group showed improved test performance, as evidenced by reducing test duration (19.75 &#x000b1; 3.36 sec) and increasing speed (6.06 &#x000b1; 0.27 sec) when compared to the corresponding values in the SD group (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Additionally, the SD+RoJ group showed a significant reduction in total distance traveled (83.68 &#x000b1; 6.83 cm) when compared to the SD group (190.38 &#x000b1; 12.21 cm) (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>MWM test results demonstrate enhancement of spatial memory and learning in the SD+RoJ group</title><p>(A) Test duration, (B) average speed, (C) traveled distance in control (C), sleep deprivation (SD), and SD treated with Rose of Jericho (SD+RoJ) groups.

While interest in natural substances like RoJ for cognitive health and mood regulation is growing, research on its effects on SD is limited, hindering evidence-based interventions. In the present study, the SD+RoJ group demonstrated potential beneficial effects on memory, learning, and behavior; RoJ could possess memory-boosting and anxiolytic effects. To our knowledge, our study is the first to report such therapeutic capacities of RoJ; hence, it substantially contributes to addressing the knowledge gap in SD's non-pharmacological interventions.</p><p>Our findings revealed that SD rats exhibited significant impairments in spatial memory, as evidenced by increased test duration, reduced average speed, and increased traveled distance in the MWM test. These deficits were effectively ameliorated by RoJ treatment, suggesting a potential role of ROJ in improving cognitive function in individuals experiencing SD. Sleep has beneficial effects on long-term memory (LTM). LTM patterns necessitate optimal sleep duration between learning and retrieval. Specifically, memory researchers have focused on the role of sleep in memory consolidation [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Neural activity during slow-wave or rapid eye movement sleep contributes to the consolidation process of memory [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Consequently, SD could deleteriously impact declarative and non-declarative memory consolidation [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Previous studies reported that SD induces hippocampal dysfunction with resultant memory deficits. Furthermore, they postulated that oxidative stress and inflammation could be the underlying mechanisms [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Interestingly, RoJ has been shown to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Their properties were effective in wound healing and improving fertility parameters [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although the effect of RoJ on SD-dependent memory deficits has not been well documented, natural herbs such as chamomile (<italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic>&#x000a0;L.) and St. John's wort (<italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic>) have been shown to improve sleep latency and overall quality, as well as to enhance cognitive parameters [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, SD rats displayed increased anxiety- and depression-like behaviors while performing the EPM test. Animals in the SD group spent less exploration time in the open arms, more exploration time in the closed arms, and a lesser number of entries when compared to the C group. Treatment with RoJ significantly improved rats' EPM test performance, suggesting a potential anxiolytic/antidepressant effect. SD is typically related to negative neurobehavioral consequences, modification of behavioral patterns, and modulation of psychiatric disorders. Sleep-induced anxiogenesis, as a concept, is well-established [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that reduced sleep quantity increases the risk of major depression. The latter itself increases the risk of SD [<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The necessity to establish a biological framework to reveal the interrelationship between SD and anxiety is crucial to establishing potential therapeutic targets for reducing sleep-induced anxiogenesis. Specific brain neurotransmitter mechanisms, such as the adenosinergic receptor system, have been postulated [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Interestingly, the link between oxidative stress and anxiety disorders is more evident in disorders associated with underlying inflammation. Disruption of physiological pathways induces oxidative stress that contributes to neuroinflammation and, subsequently, anxiety [<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, the supremacy of RoJ in the treatment of SD-induced anxiety could arise from its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>In this study, SD rats demonstrated lower motor coordination when compared to the C group and SD+RoJ group, significantly reducing the SD rats from such deleterious consequences. SD-induced deterioration in motor and neurocognitive performance involves decreased physical performance, increased mental fatigue, and changes in neurotransmitter release. The latter could limit the learning capacity and storage and&#x000a0;retrieval of&#x000a0;the learned material. This might be explained, in part, by alterations in use-dependent synaptic plasticity [<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Oxidative stress triggers multiple mechanisms that could affect motor and cognitive integrity. These mechanisms include mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal death, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Thus, mitigating oxidative stress with potent antioxidants could prevent or at least slow down the progression of the catastrophic consequences of SD [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Limitations</p><p>The results of the present study are mainly descriptive and lack mechanistic insights. However,&#x000a0;they could serve as a logical proof of concept. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to elucidate the possible underlying mechanisms and molecular targets. Additionally, further work should optimize the RoJ therapeutic dosage and conduct translational studies in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study provides compelling evidence that RoJ can effectively mitigate SD's cognitive and behavioral impairments. To our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate the potential therapeutic effects of&#x000a0;the RoJ in treating SD-induced deterioration of memory and learning, anxiogenesis, and neurocognitive incoordination.
