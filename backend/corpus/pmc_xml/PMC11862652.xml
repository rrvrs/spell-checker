The QI programme was divided into phases, including diagnostic, problem-solving, and evaluation. It employed diagnostic tools such as the fishbone cause and effect diagram and the 5-Why Technique for root cause analysis. The project&#x02019;s aim was aligned with the Model of Improvement, guided by the three fundamental questions. Change ideas were developed using driver&#x02019;s diagram and were then evaluated through PDSA cycles. Quantitative analysis utilized paired t-tests to assess the significance of changes, and qualitative analysis focused on patient perspectives gathered through the co-produced CPA questionnaire. Emerging themes from the questionnaire responses were integrated into the project&#x02019;s trajectory through narrative synthesis. Predictions were formulated to measure project success: 50% patient attendance in the next CPA meetings, 70% positive step-down discharges, and improved Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) scores.</p></sec><sec id="sec7998"><title>Results</title><p>The iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles demonstrated the evolving impact of interventions on patient engagement and discharge outcomes. Implementation of patient information leaflets, staff training, and a CPA agenda template led to increased attendance and positive step-down discharges. Analysis of HAM-A scores revealed a substantial decline in anxiety levels for almost all participants, suggesting the effectiveness of the interventions. Discharge outcomes were influenced by patient engagement and tailored interventions. Patient responses revealed themes such as challenges during transitions to community care, empowerment from shared decision-making, and diverse experiences in communication with healthcare professionals.</p></sec><sec id="sec7999"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The CPA agenda template improved patient experiences by enhancing communication and patient-centeredness.</p></sec><sec id="sec8000"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
