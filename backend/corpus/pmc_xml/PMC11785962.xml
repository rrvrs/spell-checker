Herein, we found that the ion channel Piezo1 directs neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and regulates macrophage functional differentiation in anti-influenza virus immunity. Genetic deletion of Piezo1 in neutrophils inhibited the generation of NETs and M1 macrophage differentiation while driving the development of M2 macrophages during viral infection. Piezo1-directed neutrophil NET DNA directly regulates macrophage differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, neutrophil Piezo1 deficiency inhibited NET DNA production, leading to decreased TLR9 and cGAS-STING signalling activity while inducing reciprocal differentiation from M1 to M2 macrophages. In addition, Piezo1 integrates magnesium signalling and the SIRT2-hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1&#x003b1;)-dependent pathway to orchestrate reciprocal M1 and M2 macrophage lineage commitment through neutrophil-derived NET DNA. Our studies provide critical insight into the role of neutrophil-based mechanical regulation of immunopathology in directing macrophage lineage commitment during the response to influenza virus infection.</p><p id="Par2">

Neutrophils are often the first to be recruited to the pathogen invasion site to phagocytose and present microbial antigens and provide further information for subsequent immune responses, including the recruitment of more macrophages and other immune cells or the regulation of immune cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They can phagocytose, degranulate and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) to play a role in combating pathogens during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recently, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have attracted increased interest from researchers and they have shown that NETs are crucial for the function of neutrophils. NETs are composed of dsDNA and histone and nonhistone proteins, including neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase, which regulate NET formation and antimicrobial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. ROS directly activate the protein arginine deaminase 4 (PAD4) to deconcentrate chromatin, which is critically involved in regulating NET formation by neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, macrophages often regulate immune function by differentiating into type M1 macrophages, increasing the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#x003b1;, reducing the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), or differentiating into type M2 macrophages, inhibiting the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, enhancing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and promoting the expression of CD206 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. DNA recognition receptor toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and cytoplasmic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthetase (cGAS) signalling are critically involved in regulating the functional activities of macrophages in infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, how neutrophils regulate the function of macrophages in fighting against influenza virus infection remains unclear.</p><p id="Par4">Piezo1 was originally identified as a mechanically activated nonselective cation ion channel with significant permeability to calcium and magnesium ions, is evolutionarily conserved and is involved in the proliferation and development of multiple types of cells in the context of diverse types of mechanical and/or innate stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our study and other previous studies have shown that Piezo1 is critically involved in regulating various types of immune cell functions, including those of dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils and T cells, in inflammation and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, the regulatory effect of Piezo1 on neutrophils, especially during influenza virus infection, is still unclear.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we found that the response of the neutrophil ion channel sensor Piezo1 influences virus and magnesium signals and directs the reciprocal differentiation of M1 and M2 macrophages. Piezo1 largely acts by integrating the SIRT2&#x02013;hypoxia&#x02013;inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1&#x003b1;)-dependent signalling pathway and regulates the production of NET DNA by neutrophils as well as the signalling activation of TLR9 and cGAS&#x02013;STING by responding macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mice</title><p id="Par6">The animals were maintained in pathogen-free conditions.

During pathogenic microorganisms invasion, neutrophils are recruited to the site of inflammation to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, neutrophils are also able to transmit some antigen information to other immune cells by some means, inducing an immune response cascade and triggering a protective immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In this study, the ion sensor Piezo1 was shown to direct neutrophil NET formation and regulate M1 macrophage differentiation during the response to in influenza virus infection. <italic>Piezo1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils had reduced NET DNA production, leading to decreased TLR9 and cGAS&#x02013;STING signalling activity while inducing reciprocal differentiation from M1 to M2 macrophages. In addition, Piezo1 integrated magnesium signalling and the SIRT2&#x02013;HIF1&#x003b1; signalling pathway to orchestrate reciprocal M1 and M2 macrophage lineage commitment through neutrophil NET formation (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S17</xref>). Thus, our studies provide comprehensive insight into the role of neutrophil-based mechanical regulation of immunopathology in directing macrophage lineage commitment during the response to influenza virus infection.</p><p id="Par45">When pathogens such as respiratory influenza viruses invade the body, neutrophils are the first-line defenders recruited to the lesion loci of local respiratory tract and lungs. The immune functions of neutrophils include phagocytosis, the production of ROS, and the formation and release of NETs. Recent studies have shown that NETs are critically involved in defending against pathogen infection-induced inflammation and tumour inflammation. NETs, which are composed of deconcentrated chromatin DNA, the histone myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase, play important roles in defending against pathogenic microbial invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The release of NETs and their component extracellular DNA is an effective weapon for the immune response. As one of the innate immune components, neutrophils release NETs in response to invading pathogens, which help them capture and kill pathogenic microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, it is still unclear whether neutrophil NETs have other regulatory effects. Our study revealed that neutrophil NETs are critical for inducing macrophage differentiation during antiviral immune responses. The release of NET DNA from neutrophils effectively triggers DNA sensor, TLR9 and cGAS&#x02013;STING signalling activities to induce M1 macrophage differentiation in antiviral immunity.</p><p id="Par46">The mechanism of neutrophil NET production has long been a focus of research. It has been shown that ROS are critical for NET formation in neutrophils. ROS can directly activate PAD4 to deconcentrate chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. ROS can also release NE from azurophilic granules into the cytoplasm by activating MPO, where NE can bind to F-actin and degrade it to enter the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the nucleus, NE can hydrolyse histones and destroy chromatin packaging, thus affecting the formation of NETs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Consistent with previous studies, our study revealed that ROS and PAD4 are critically involved in regulating neutrophil NET formation during antiviral responses. The activation of NADPH oxidase complexes through the classical protein kinase C (PKC) or RAF-MEK-MAPK pathways results in the production of ROS and then the formation of NETs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Our data further revealed that the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase SIRT2, no other SIRT family members, is critically involved in regulating NET formation induced by Piezo1. The transcription factor HIF1&#x003b1; is critically involved in regulating Piezo1-induced innate immune cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. SIRT1 is responsible for the direct deacetylation and destabilization of HIF1&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Our data showed that SIRT2&#x02013;HIF1&#x003b1;, a redox-related mechanism, is required for regulating PAD4&#x02013;ROS signalling-mediated NET formation in <italic>Piezo1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils during the immune response to viral infections.</p><p id="Par47">Recent studies have reported that Piezo1 is involved in regulating the functions of various immune cells, including macrophages, DCs and T cells, in infectious inflammation and cancer. Piezo1 regulates macrophage polarization and stiffness sensing for macrophage activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The Piezo1-mediated macrophage inflammatory response to LPS occurs through the TLR4 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. DC Piezo1 directs reciprocal differentiation between T<sub>H</sub>1 and regulatory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, the regulatory role of Piezo1 in neutrophils has not been reported. Our data showed that influenza virus infection initiated Piezo1 activity and directed neutrophil NET formation. The ion channel Piezo1, as a signal node, senses the magnesium concentration and integrates the downstream SIRT2&#x02013;HIF1&#x003b1; signalling pathway to direct NET formation during the response to viral infection.</p><p id="Par48">Piezo1 was originally identified as a nonselective cation ion channel with significant permeability to calcium ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, blocking calcium influx cannot affect Piezo1-mediated NET formation in neutrophils. It has been shown that magnesium-sufficiency sensed via LFA-1 is related to the superior performance of pathogen- and tumour-specific T cells, enhanced the effectiveness of bispecific T-cell-engaging antibodies, and improved CAR T-cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our data further revealed that magnesium-sufficiency is involved in Piezo1-directed NET formation to regulate macrophage differentiation during the response to virus infection. A low-magnesium diet ameliorates Piezo1-mediated NET formation and M1 macrophage differentiation, which contributes to relieving inflammation caused by virus infection. These data should be helpful for the dietary management of clinical respiratory tract virus infections.</p><p id="Par49">Inflammatory signals and ion signals are closely associated with the immune response, but few studies have investigated the regulation of the magnesium signalling pathway and immune response. Our data showed that Piezo1 could respond to magnesium signalling pathways and further modulate neutrophil NET formation in the context of infectious inflammation. Effective immune responses require neutrophils to function under various conditions, including altered extracellular inflammatory states and ion levels (possibly caused by inflammatory stimulation) or nutritional and/or hypoxic environments (inflammatory microenvironments). The adaptation of neutrophils to changing redox states results from a &#x0201c;ion channel sensor checkpoint&#x0201d;, an active signalling process involved in sensing changes in extracellular inflammatory and magnesium levels and subsequent signal transduction and execution. Our data further suggested that the ion channel sensor Piezo1 in neutrophils is critically required for regulating NET formation and subsequent M1 macrophage differentiation.</p><p id="Par50">In summary, targeting the ion channel sensor Piezo1 in neutrophils alters NET DNA production and TLR9 and cGAS signalling activities, thereby contributing to the reciprocal differentiation of M1 and M2 macrophages while responding to viral infection. Thus, our results define the essential nature of Piezo1 as a signalling node that transduces virus infectious signals and magnesium signals to initiate the signalling activities of the Piezo1&#x02013;SIRT2-HIF1&#x003b1; signalling pathway in neutrophils for NET formation. This signalling induces the reciprocal differentiation of M1 and M2 macrophages and has implications for targeting neutrophils as an approach to the treatment of viral infections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
