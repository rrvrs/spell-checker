Weight loss was observed at weeks 48 and 96, with an average decrease in weight of 3.3 kg from baseline (range: -24 to +6 kg) in post hoc analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this pilot trial, DTG/3TC was effective, with no PWH having an HIV-1 RNA &#x02265;50 copies/mL at week 48 in the setting of unknown resistance. Furthermore, VS was maintained at the secondary endpoint, week 96. The presence of archived resistance, including M184I/V, did not affect viral suppression or lead to VF. Additionally, after two years of follow-up, no cases of treatment-emergent INSTI resistance were reported.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of switching to DTG/3TC from a stable ART regimen through 48 weeks [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the DYAD study, participants were randomized to either stay on B/FTC/TAF or switch to DTG/3TC; it was found that DTG/3TC was noninferior through 48 weeks [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The PASO DOBLE study also demonstrated noninferiority of DTG/3TC compared to B/FTC/TAF when switching from a stable regimen [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our study, although smaller than the previously mentioned studies, provides efficacy data for DTG/3TC through 96 weeks.</p><p>Despite evidence supporting the efficacy of DTG/3TC, concerns about VF due to resistance remain. Some studies have reported efficacy data even in the absence of baseline resistance testing. In the DYAD study, for example, 44% of participants who were virologically suppressed on B/FTC/TAF and were switched to DTG/3TC had no genotype available at baseline, and DTG/3TC still performed well [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Of note, one case of M184M/I together with an INSTI secondary mutation (G140G/S, treatment-emergence unknown) was reported in the B/FTC/TAF arm [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the SOLAR-3D trial, 100 participants, 50 with known MI84I/V and 50 without resistance testing at baseline, were evaluated for the efficacy of DTG/3TC at 48 weeks and found no cases of VF [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A meta-analysis investigating a stable switch to DTG/3TC in the presence of preexisting M184I/V mutations demonstrated that switching to DTG/3TC was effective in maintaining VS in patients with archived M184I/V mutations and found no cases of treatment-emergent INSTI resistance, even in the presence of historical or current M184V/I mutations, which is aligned to the results we report here [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Another important finding from this trial is the trend toward a decrease in weight from baseline. At two years, participants decreased their weight by 7.1 lbs (3.2 kg) without using other weight loss modalities. Since this was a single-arm study, we do not have a comparative arm; however, it is consistent with the PASO DOBLE study, which shows significantly less weight gain in suppressed PWH switching to DTG/3TC compared to switching to B/FTC/TAF. A similar finding was reported in the DRAGON study, which compared weight changes in treatment-naive Asian PWH who initiated either DTG/3TC or B/FTC/TAF [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The difference in the adjusted mean weight from baseline to week 48 in the DTG/3TC group was smaller than that observed in the B/FTC/TAF group; this finding is consistent with the results reported here [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the previously mentioned DYAD study, there was no significant weight difference between those who switched to DTG/3TC compared to those who continued on B/FTC/TAF at 48 weeks. However, this could be due to the presence of a colocated weight loss health center.</p><p>The strengths of the SOUND study include its high percentage of Black (55%) and female (45%) participants, which adds to the diversity of the study population. Additionally, the study provides valuable data on the prevalence of RAMs&#x000a0;and their impact on treatment outcomes. However, the study's limitations include its single-center, nonrandomized, single-arm design, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the SOUND study supports the efficacy and safety of switching to DTG/3TC for people living with HIV-1 who are virologically suppressed on B/FTC/TAF with unknown resistance history. It also supports other studies' data, suggesting less weight gain with DTG/3TC compared to B/FTC/TAF. The study's findings are consistent with other real-world and interventional trials, providing additional evidence for the use of DTG/3TC in diverse populations.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
