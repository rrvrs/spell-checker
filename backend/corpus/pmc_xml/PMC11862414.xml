However, concerns often arise regarding the validity and reliability of data collected via the internet. The Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) is a self-report questionnaire to measure the traits associated with autism spectrum disorder (Baron-Cohen <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. J Autism Dev Disord, 2001; 31 5-17) and the online usage of AQ is common and conducted with large numbers of participants across many studies. However, the effect of using internet-based data collection for AQ rather than conventional paper-based procedures is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="sec8105"><title>Objectives</title><p>
To address this issue, we conducted a study comparing the effectiveness of internet-based and paper-based data collection procedures for both the AQ and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21, Lovibond &#x00026; Lovibond, Behav Res Ther 1995; 33 335&#x02013;343), which is also a prevalent mental health measurement in the literature and often used for online data collection (Zlomke, Comput Hum Behav 2009; 25 841-843). In addition, to compare internet-based and paper-based methods more fully, we included another variable (type of supervision) where a researcher was either present or absent during the completion of the questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="sec8106"><title>Methods</title><p>A power analysis was conducted, and a minimum of 90 participants were needed to reach a medium effect size of .30 with an adequate power of .80 at a= .05. Accordingly, 96 participants were used and randomly assigned across 4 data collection groups: internet-based (supervision, no supervision) and paper-based (supervision, no supervision). In addition to a Demographic Form, AQ, and DASS-21 were used to obtain the data. Three independent variables were used in the current study: type of presentation (internet-based and paper-based) and type of supervision as between factors, and type of assessment as a within factor.</p></sec><sec id="sec8107"><title>Results</title><p>Using a 2 x 2 x 2 mixed design ANOVA, no significant main effects were found for any independent variables (all <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003e; .33) or interaction (all <italic toggle="yes">ps</italic> &#x0003e; .17).</p></sec><sec id="sec8108"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of using AQ and DASS-21 were not altered by using internet-based or paper-based data collection procedures, suggesting that both methodologies are equally valid for this purpose.&#x000a0;Moreover, these effects were also unaffected by the presence or absence of a researcher during data collection, suggesting that supervision by an authoritative figure does not alter the responses made.</p></sec><sec id="sec8109"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
