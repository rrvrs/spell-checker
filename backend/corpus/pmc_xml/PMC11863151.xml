exploit
a noncovalent labeling mechanism, which constitutes a fundamental
limitation in multiple bioimaging applications. Here, we report a
concept of lipid-directed covalent labeling of PM, which exploits
transient binding to the lipid membrane surface generating a high
local dye concentration, thus favoring covalent ligation to random
proximal membrane proteins. This concept yielded fluorescent probes
for PM called MemGraft, which are built of a dye (cyanine Cy3 or Cy5)
bearing a low-affinity membrane anchor and a reactive group: an activated
ester or a maleimide. In contrast to specially designed control dyes
and commercial Cy3-based labels of amino or thiol groups, MemGraft
probes stain efficiently PM, revealing the crucial role of the membrane
anchor combined with optimal reactivity of the activated ester or
the maleimide. MemGraft probes overcome existing limitations of noncovalent
probes, which makes them compatible with cell fixation, permeabilization,
trypsinization, and the presence of serum. The latter allows long-term
cell tracking and video imaging of cell PM dynamics without the signs
of phototoxicity. The covalent strategy also enables staining and
long-term tracking of cocultured cells labeled in different colors
without exchange of probes. Moreover, the combination of MemGraft-Cy3
and MemGraft-Cy5 probes at different ratios enabled long-term cell
barcoding in at least 5 color codes, important for tracking and visualizing
multiple populations of cells. Ultimately, we found that the MemGraft
strategy enables efficient biotinylation of the cell surface, opening
the path to cell surface engineering and cell manipulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fluorescent membrane probes</kwd><kwd>directed covalent labeling</kwd><kwd>cellular imaging</kwd><kwd>cell tracking</kwd><kwd>cell surface

frontier at the cell
surface. It is not a simple barrier between the cell interior and
the environment, but a highly organized two-dimensional structure
with specially organized lipids and proteins, which plays essential
roles in the signaling, transport of nutrients, cell&#x02013;cell recognition,
motility, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Therefore, the development of fluorescent tools to
image and probe cell plasma membranes is currently a subject of intensive
research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p><p>So far, a large variety of fluorescent membrane probes have
been
developed. Some operate like basic membrane markers, which include
for instance cyanine derivatives, like DiO, DiI, PKH, and more advanced
analogues, such as MemBright.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Other probes are designed
for sensing local membrane properties, including local polarity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> viscosity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> and tension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> that help to
understand lipid organization, or detect local pH,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> ions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> specific lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> or membrane proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> However, most of those
examples are based on lipophilic or amphiphilic lipid anchors or protein
ligands, which interact noncovalently with cell plasma membranes.
The noncovalent labeling of PM implies that the probes could exchange
with the environment, in particular, membranes of other cells or serum
proteins. Moreover, after fixation and permeabilization, used in a
variety of staining protocols especially immunofluorescence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> these probes are generally washed away from the cell surface, because
membrane integrity is compromised and most of the lipids and lipid
probes are removed by the detergents. These issues make those probes
also incompatible with expansion microscopy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> tissue clearing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> Moreover, fast lateral diffusion of PM probes makes them poorly
compatible with super-resolution imaging, in particular single-molecule
localization microscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup></p><p>A promising solution is the covalent grafting of fluorescent
dyes
to proteins, which is compatible with both fixation and permeabilization
protocols. The efficient labeling approaches include the use of potent
tags, such as SnapTag,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> HaloTag,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> ClipTag,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> etc., but they require genetic
modification of the cell. Direct labeling of native proteins on the
cell surface could be done, for instance, by activated esters of <italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). However, this approach is not
so convenient and efficient, because this labeling reaction requires
high concentrations of the labeling agent (&#x0223c;5 &#x003bc;M).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> Therefore, we hypothesized that the labeling
could be accelerated by designing a reactive probe capable of first
binding to the cell surface noncovalently. Then, the high local concentration
of the probe would favor fast labeling of neighboring proteins. In
this respect, one should mention affinity-based protein labeling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> where an affinity ligand that binds a specific protein site favors
covalent grafting to a proximal reactive group of the protein. It
was successfully applied as covalent inhibitors in drug discovery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> as well as for site specific labeling of antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></sup> and specific labeling of membrane
receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup> However, these are approaches for selective protein labeling, which
would target only a limited fraction of specific proteins, inefficient
for bright staining of PM. Therefore, we considered a different strategy
where the designed probe would label nonselectively a large variety
of membrane proteins. For this purpose, noncovalent interaction with
lipids of PM could be exploited. The abundance of lipids on the PM
would ensure that membrane-bound probes would randomly label any
available membrane protein, which could provide efficient high density
covalent plasma membrane labeling.</p><p>Although the targeting of
PM is usually done with high-affinity
membrane probes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> the removal of nonreacted probes after the covalent labeling would
be difficult in this case. Therefore, it would be interesting to explore
low-affinity membrane targeting groups, which could reversibly bind
to cell plasma membranes. Recently, we introduced low-affinity amphiphilic
anchors for plasma membrane targeting composed of butyl chain and
charged sulfonate headgroup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> Reversible low-affinity
binding of probes based on solvatochromic Nile Red<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> and fluorogenic dimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> enabled
PAINT-type super-resolution imaging of plasma membranes. However,
it remains unexplored whether this reversible binding could favor
a reaction between the activated ester or maleimide group and membrane
proteins, which would enable efficient covalent grafting of fluorescent
probes to plasma membranes.</p><p>In the present work, we designed
a series of cyanine derivatives
bearing a low-affinity membrane targeting anchor group in combination
with a reactive group for conjugation. We found that the combination
of low-affinity anchor with the activated ester or maleimide group
provides strong labeling of the cell surface for both cyanine 3 (Cy3)
and cyanine 5 (Cy5) analogues, which was not the case for nonactivated
carboxylate control analogues. Moreover, the control compound with
a truncated anchor (without butyl group) did not show plasma membrane
labeling, which highlights the fact that membrane protein labeling
is catalyzed by probe-lipid interactions. Importantly, the obtained
plasma membrane labeling showed resistance to the presence of serum
as well as to cell fixation and permeabilization in contrast to a
reference plasma membrane probe of MemBright family. The MemGraft
strategy also enables long-term cell tracking and multicolor barcoding
of multiple cocultured cell populations. The covalent strategy also
allowed design of the MemGraft probe for cell biotinylation and further
cell manipulation with magnetic beads. The developed probe will find
multiple applications in cellular imaging, cell surface engineering,
and cell manipulation, where robust grafting to the cell surface is
needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>General Methods and Materials</title><p>All of the reagents were

on a cyanine fluorophore, bearing on one end a low-affinity membrane
anchor composed of a butyl chain and sulfonate group, while the other
end of cyanine bears an activated ester (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>A, B). In our hypothesis, the low-affinity
membrane anchor would provide a transient binding to a lipid membrane,
as we showed for Nile Red<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> and cyanine
dimers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> which is expected to ensure a
high local concentration of the probe at the membrane level (vs buffer)
in close proximity to membrane proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). The latter should favor covalent grafting
of the active ester with amino groups of membrane proteins, which
is needed for covalent labeling of plasma membranes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). The synthesis was based
on our previous report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> where corresponding
cyanine (Cy3 or Cy5) dicarboxylate, was first monofunctionalized with
the anchor (3-(butylammonio)propane-1-sulfonate) and then, after purification,
the second carboxylate was converted into activated NHS ester using
TSTU (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>). These compounds are called
here MemGraft-Cy3 and MemGraft-Cy5 probes, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). To understand
the role of the anchor group, we synthesized Cy3 analogues without
butyl chain (dye <bold>1</bold>) and with octyl chain (dye <bold>2</bold>). To this end, the Cy3 dicarboxylate was first monofunctionalized
by 3-aminopropane-1-sulfonate or 3-(octylammonio)propane-1-sulfonate,
and the second carboxylate was converted into NHS ester using TSTU
to yield dyes <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, respectively. Then,
to explore the importance of the activated ester, we also synthesized
MemGraft-Cy3 analogues, bearing fluorophenyl activated esters of increasing
reactivity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>): 2-fluorophenyl (dye <bold>3</bold>) and 2,6-difluorophenyl (dye <bold>4</bold>), 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl (dye <bold>5</bold>) and 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenyl

identical to that of a reference probe MemBright-488<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>), suggesting efficient
PM targeting. At the same labeling conditions, control analogues without
activated carboxylate (dyes <bold>7</bold> and <bold>8</bold>) showed
practically no membrane staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">S4</ext-link>). The
latter suggests that, as expected, these control probes exhibit low
affinity to plasma membranes and therefore can be completely removed
by washing. We also compared MemGraft-Cy3 with its methyl ester analogue
(dye <bold>17</bold>), which cannot react with the amino groups. Importantly,
no plasma membrane labeling was observed (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">Figure S5</ext-link>). Given that the structure and calculated LogP (cLogP) of
these two control dyes (cLogP is 0.82 and 1.25 for dyes <bold>7</bold> and <bold>17</bold>, respectively) are very close to those of MemGraft-Cy3
(cLogP = 0.52), we can conclude that, similar to these two controls,
MemGraft-Cy3 does not present any significant fraction of noncovalently
bound species to the cell surface after labeling and washing steps.
Therefore, the signal from the activated probes at the plasma membrane
corresponds exclusively to that of the covalently grafted probes.
To understand the role of hydrophobic interactions of the probes in
membrane protein labeling, we varied the alkyl chain of the anchor
of MemGraft-Cy3. Thus, we designed an analogue without any alkyl group
(dye <bold>1</bold>) and with an octyl group (dye <bold>2</bold>),
which are expected to strongly alter their affinity to lipid membranes
compared to the parent MemGraft-Cy3. Remarkably, control probe <bold>1</bold> showed mainly intracellular fluorescence with poor plasma
membrane labeling, in contrast to MemGraft-Cy3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). This dramatic change in the labeling profile
caused by the removal of the butyl group indicates that the latter
plays a crucial role in PM labeling. On the other hand, dye <bold>2</bold> with octyl chain showed good PM labeling, in contrast to
its nonactivated acid analogue <bold>10</bold> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). Indeed, the butyl or octyl groups should
favor transient binding and certain accumulation of the probe on the
lipid membrane surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> This is expected
to ensure a high local concentration of the MemGraft probes that would
favor covalent grafting to membrane proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). On the other hand, the analogue without
the butyl group cannot stay sufficiently long at the cell surface
and show some capacity to penetrate PM, which can explain the lack
of PM labeling and the significant intracellular signal. A similar
difference between MemGraft-Cy3 and the control dye <bold>1</bold> without a butyl group was observed at a lower concentration (0.1

shows that the MemGraft probe can efficiently label PM despite this

bear activated esters for amino group labeling of varied reactivity.
However, they did not provide efficient plasma membrane labeling but
rather significant intracellular staining (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">Figure S7</ext-link>). Nevertheless, we observed an interesting tendency. While
compounds <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold> with lower reactivity
toward amino groups showed exclusively intracellular staining, more
reactive dyes <bold>5</bold> and <bold>6</bold> exhibited a clearly
seen cell contour (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">Figure S7</ext-link>). The membrane
staining was the best seen for the most reactive dye <bold>6</bold> in this series, where membrane extensions could be well identified,
although the intracellular fluorescence remained strong (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">Figure S7</ext-link>). These results indicate that reactivity
of the active ester is crucial for efficient plasma membrane labeling.
We can conclude that, in contrast to NHS esters, none of the fluorophenyl
esters are reactive enough, as the internalization goes faster than
the protein labeling. Moreover, fluorophenyl esters are much more
hydrophobic than the NHS is, which could additionally favor internalization
by crossing the plasma membrane.</p><p>We also compared our MemGraft
probes with commercial reference
dye disulfo-Cy3-NHS, which is routinely used for amino-group labeling
of proteins. Fluorescence microscopy of cells labeled with disulfo-Cy3-NHS
at the same experimental conditions showed a significantly smaller
signal at the cell surface compared to MemGraft-Cy3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>A,B). Quantitative image analysis
revealed &#x0223c;4-fold higher signal from cell PM labeled with MemGraft-Cy3
compared to disulfo-Cy3-NHS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>E). This result confirms that the presence of membrane
anchor significantly improves membrane labeling, because it favors
higher local dye concentrations in the membrane that can catalyze
the reaction with the amino groups of membrane proteins. To further
shed light on the nature of the labeling, the amino residues on the
cell surface were blocked by treatment with Sulfo-NHS-acetate on cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> This is a highly polar agent, which is expected
to acetylate only water-exposed amino-group residues at the cell surface.
After the treatment, the cells were stained with MemGraft-Cy3 or disulfo-Cy3-NHS
and the fluorescence intensity of the cells was compared to those
without the blocking treatment (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">Figure S8</ext-link>). Remarkably, the blocking by Sulfo-NHS-acetate nearly totally inhibited
cell membrane labeling of disulfo-Cy3-NHS with only 8% residual fluorescence
signal, while the staining by MemGraft-Cy3 was decreased to a small
extent (60% of the residual fluorescence signal). This proves that
the nature of the MemGraft labeling is different from classical polar
NHS-ester reagents, like disulfo-Cy3-NHS. Due to the presence of the
low-affinity membrane anchor, MemGraft-Cy3 probably labels amino groups
of proteins in close contact with the lipid bilayer that cannot be
accessed by Sulfo-NHS-acetate (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">Figure S8</ext-link>), while commercial disulfo-Cy3-NHS labels exposed amino groups assessable
for Sulfo-NHS-acetate. Then, we also tested maleimide analogue MemGraft-Cy3M
and compared it to a commercial thiol label based on Cy3, disulfo-Cy3-MAL.
Remarkably, MemGraft-Cy3M showed clear labeling of PM, while disulfo-Cy3-MAL
failed to label PM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>C,D), with an &#x0223c;50-fold difference in the signal at
the PM level (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>E). This result confirms the crucial role of low-affinity membrane
anchor for covalent PM labeling. Disulfo-Cy3-MAL did not label PM
at all probably because thiol groups of membrane proteins are not
accessible for this highly polar label, while MemGraft-Cy3M, owing
to its membrane binding, can reach and react with membrane-shielded
thiol groups.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of MemGraft-Cy3 and MemGraft-Cy3M with commercial

FSC analysis, and the fluorescence signals from single cells were
then evaluated for both covalent probes at the same concentrations
(0.1 or 1 &#x003bc;M). For both studied concentrations, the fluorescence
mean intensity of MemGraft-Cy3 probe was 3-foldhigher than that of
disulfo-Cy3-NHS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>), which is in line with the microscopy data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>). This result suggests a higher density
of labeling for MemGraft-Cy3 compared to its analogue without membrane

confirmed the superiority of MemGraft approach compared to direct
labeling of amino groups by a commercial dye NHS-ester. It highlights
the importance of low-affinity membrane anchor in MemGraft that allows
the preorganization of the reactive probe close to amino groups of
the membrane proteins, required for efficient membrane labeling. It
enables relatively high labeling density for rather low probe concentrations

a model membrane
containing surface amino groups was realized to confirm the chemistry
of the labeling. Large Unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared with
a lipid composition of DOPC/DOPE (1:1). The formed liposomes present
exofacial reactive amino groups on their outer surface, which are
expected to react with MemGraft. The liposomes were incubated with
a MemGraft-Cy3 probe, followed by purification by size-exclusion column
chromatography and further mass spectrometry. We found a mass-to-charge
ratio at 1403.58, corresponding to the conjugate of MemGraft-Cy3 with
DOPE (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">Figure S9</ext-link>). This result confirms
the capacity of MemGraft-Cy3 to form covalent bonds with amino groups
at the membrane surface, which suggests the covalent nature of the
labeling in cell PM. However, on the cell surface, the reaction of
MemGraft probe with the amino-groups of membrane proteins is more
probable, because PE and phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids are lacking
at the outer leaflet of PM of healthy cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref></sup> To verify this point, we performed SDS-page on cytosolic and membrane
protein extracts of MemGraft-stained cells. The obtained results suggest
that a large range of proteins was labeled by MemGraft-Cy3, as it
could be seen by a contentious signal over multiple molecular masses
from 20 to 250 kDa (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">Figure S10</ext-link>). In the
case of MemGraft-Cy3M, the signal was much weaker but still visible
for proteins of different molecular weight, with predominance of one
fraction around 50 kDa. In contrast, cytosolic proteins did not show
any signal for both MemGraft probes, confirming that the labeling
is specific to membrane proteins only. Thus, as expected, chemically
reactive MemGraft probes label nonselectively membrane proteins, which
is essential for the efficient labeling of cell plasma membranes.
Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that some fraction of the MemGraft
probe reacts with PE and/or PS lipids of cell PM, especially when
their content at the outer leaflet is increased.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Resistance to Serum</title><p>Next, we evaluated the capacity
of the new probes to remain on the membrane surface despite the presence
of a full growth medium containing serum, which is essential for cell
growth. The MemGraft-Cy3 probe was compared to a commercial reference
probe (MemBright-488) that binds noncovalently to the plasma membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> After 5 min of incubation in 20% FBS, the membrane
staining by the MemGraft-Cy3 probe remains similar to that of reference
probe MemBright-488 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>). However, after longer incubation in the presence of serum,
the PM signal of MemBright-488 progressively declined and became poorly
detectable after 45 min. The remaining signal appeared mainly as perinuclear
dotted fluorescence, corresponding probably to endosomes. In contrast,
in the presence of 20% FBS, the membrane staining by MemGraft-Cy3
remained similar to that without FBS for the whole observation period,
even though a small fraction of intracellular dots could also be 
observed after 45 min, clearly due to the endocytosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>). These differences between
the two probes were also confirmed by the quantitative image analysis,
suggesting a stable labeling by MemGraft-Cy3 and progressive loss
of fluorescence signal by MemBright-488 in the presence of serum (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>B). Thus, we can
conclude that FBS can detach MemBright-488 probe from the cell surface,
whereas the remaining fraction of the probe is internalized by endocytosis.
On the other hand, MemGraft-Cy3 probe resisted well to FBS, so only
endocytosis process affected to some extent the imaging contrast over
time. Moreover, direct composition of the same sample of cells labeled
with MemGraft-Cy3 before and after addition of 20% FBS suggested no
significant variations in the signal (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">Figure S11</ext-link>), which confirms that the labeling is exclusively covalent and the
fraction of MemGraft-Cy3 noncovalently bound to PM is negligible.
Thus, the MemGraft probe enables imaging of PM in live cells in the
presence of serum, which was not possible before with conventional
membrane markers. This is important for longitudinal studies of cell
behavior without cell starvation.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Resistance of a MemGraft probe to the

dramatic effects can be produced on membrane probes during the fixation
and permeabilization of the cells. Indeed, while lipids and conventional
membrane probes cannot be fixed by paraformaldehyde (PFA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref></sup> they are expected to be washed out during the permeabilization with
surfactant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref></sup> Therefore, we studied the
effect of fixation and permeabilization on the cell staining with
the MemGraft-Cy3 probe in comparison to the reference MemBright-488.
After fixation with PFA, both MemBright and MemGraft probes showed
plasma membrane staining with good colocalization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>). This was expected given
that the fixation does not directly disturb lipid bilayers and thus
the labeling should be preserved even with noncovalent membrane probes.
Second, we performed cell permeabilization, which is commonly used
for immunofluorescence. Under permeabilization conditions using a
standard protocol based on Tween-20 surfactant, MemBright-488 probe
lost specificity to plasma membranes, showing the emission signal
all over the cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>). In contrast, the labeling profile of MemGraft-Cy3 was affected
to a minimal extent, showing clear selective plasma membrane staining
(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>). Thus, permeabilization
based on the detergent treatment led to the removal of lipid bilayers,
which led to the loss of plasma membrane staining by MemBright-488,
accompanied by internalization of the probe inside the cells. On the
other hand, MemGraft-Cy3 probe was attached covalently to membrane
proteins, which were fixed by PFA. Then, the application of detergent
affected mainly lipids without a strong effect on the fixed membrane
proteins, which explains the resistance of the probe to permeabilization.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Resistance

labeling. To this end, we incubated the cells with the MemGraft-Cy3

resistance of MemGraft-Cy3 to trypsinization is surprising because
one would expect that cleavage of proteins at the cell surface could
lead to the removal of the covalent probe. We could explain this notable
resistance to trypsinization by its labeling to amino residues of

after 24 h incubation (MemGraft-Cy3 was not studied to avoid a cross-talk
with the MTT assay). The results showed negligibly low cytotoxicity
of the probe, as &#x0003e;80% of cell viability was observed for concentration
range up to 5000 nM without statistically significant effects (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">Figure S13</ext-link>). Next, we tested the possibility
of using MemGraft for tracking cells and their interactions with other
cells in a natural growth medium. Classical noncovalent membrane labeling
by membrane probes is not suitable for this purpose because serum
extracts the probe and the liberated dye could be exchanged between
the cells. Two populations of U87 cells were labeled separately with
MemGraft-Cy3 and MemGraft-Cy5 and washed. The cells were detached
by accutase treatment (milder than trypsinization) and after centrifugation
and washing, they were seeded either separately or together in the
full-growth medium with FBS. After 5 h of the labeling, both probes
showed significant labeling of the cell plasma membrane as well as
perinuclear dots, corresponding to endosomes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">S14</ext-link>). Thus,
as expected, some fraction of the probes internalized, while the remaining
fraction stayed at the plasma membrane despite the presence of FBS
in the medium. Importantly, MemGraft-Cy3 and MemGraft-Cy5 labeled
cells incubated separately were observed exclusively in Cy3 and Cy5
channels, respectively, with minimal cross-talk between the channels
(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>-A2-B1), which
should allow us to distinguish well the signal from the two different
probes. The coincubated cells labeled with two different probes resulted
in the observation of two cell populations of different colors (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>-C3-D3). The cells
of different colors showed clearly distinctive signals from the individual
probes without signs of mixing (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">S14</ext-link>). It is
important to note that the individual colors without mixing were observed
even for cells in direct contact with each other (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>-C3). The only exception was
the direct contact between the two membranes, which appeared in a
different color (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>-C3), because the distance between the two plasma membranes was below
the resolution of optical microscopy. This shows that even in the
proximity, the probes grafted to the membrane proteins do not exchange
with the neighboring cells allowing tracking the interaction of the
individual cells. After a 29 h coincubation of two differently labeled
cell populations, we could still observe very similar staining profiles,
where plasma membranes labeled with MemGraft probes could be clearly
identified (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">S14</ext-link>). Due to the cell division, the
cell density was higher, so most of the cells were in direct contact
with each other. Nevertheless, the individual cells labeled with two
distinct colors of MemGraft-Cy3 and MemGraft-Cy5 probes could still
be clearly identified with relatively small color mixing. Some intracellular
dots appeared in a different color (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>-D3, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">S14</ext-link>) indicating
that the cells could internalize membrane proteins of other cells,
probably originating from dead cells or exosomes. A better understanding
of the transfer of membrane proteins between the cells would require
a dedicated study. We also challenged our two-color cell tracking
approach in video imaging for 1 h. We could clearly see fast dynamics
of cell membranes of both green (MemGraft-Cy3) and red (MemGraft-Cy5)
cell populations (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_003.mp4">Video S2</ext-link>). Although MemGraft-Cy5
showed some photobleaching in contrast to MemGraft-Cy3, both probes
allowed tracking of cell migration without any visual impact on their
behavior. The latter confirmed negligible phototoxicity of these probes,
which is essential for the multicolor long-term cell tracking.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Coculture and

probes to track cells in two colors without exchange of the Cy3- and
Cy5-analogues, we explored the possibility of barcoding the cells
in multiple colors using these probes. The covalent labeling of PM
could in principle enable costaining of PM with different combinations
of green (MemGraft-Cy3) and red (MemGraft-Cy5) probes, thus generating
a characteristic barcode for each cell population. To this end, we
labeled cells using five probe combinations of MemGraft-Cy3/MemGraft-Cy5
molar %: (1) 100%/0%, (2) 75%/25%, (3) 50%/50%, (4) 25%/75% and (5)
0%/100%. First, individual cell populations labeled with these combinations
were imaged using green and red channels, corresponding to Cy3 and
Cy5 dyes. Once the images from individual channels were built, the
merged (composite) images were constructed by simple combination of
the two channels (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">Figure S15</ext-link>). As a result,
we observed that each population was characterized by its own color
code, which was homogeneous within the cell population: green, lime,
yellow, orange, and red (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></xref>A). This result indicates that the two probes stain
cells in a highly homogeneous manner and with a similar efficiency.
Then, all five cell populations were detached and then coincubated
together for 3 h and imaged by the same method (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></xref>B). We found that the cells displaying different
color barcodes were simultaneously present on the surface (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></xref>C). Importantly,
all five populations with green, lime, yellow, orange and red barcodes
could be readily identified on these images. These observations indicate
that after cell detachment of coculture, the barcode was preserved
within the individual cells and it did not exchange within different
cells. Thus, MemGraft dyes enable barcoding of cells at the level
of PM and further tracking of multiple (at least 5) cell populations
simultaneously, using just two probes.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>(A) Confocal fluorescence

MemGraft probes to label covalently live cells at their plasma membrane
opens unique opportunities in cell surface engineering, which is a
rapidly developing research direction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup> To address
this point, we designed a MemGraft-Cy3 derivative bearing a biotin
residue through a PEG3 linker (MemGraft-Cy3-biotin, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref></xref>A). Biotin is an attractive
plug-and-play unit, which enables specific conjugation and manipulation
using biotin&#x02013;streptavidin coupling. Incubation of cells with
MemGraft-Cy3-biotin resulted in specific plasma membrane labeling,
which showed that the modification of MemGraft-Cy3 with PEG3 and biotin
units did not alter its PM-specific labeling (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref></xref>B). Next, we verified whether the attached
biotin unit is capable to interact with streptavidin. To this end,
cells labeled with MemGraft-Cy3-biotin were incubated with streptavidin-Cy5
conjugate and then imaged at three channels: (1) the Cy3 channel to
visualize MemGraft-Cy3 part; (2) Cy5 emission channel with Cy3 excitation
in order to eventually observe Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)
from MemGraft-Cy3 to attached streptavidin-Cy5 (FRET channel) and
(3) at the Cy5 emission channel with Cy5 excitation in order to detect
streptavidin-Cy5 part (direct Cy5 channel). We found a strong membrane-specific
signal at the Cy5 channel with Cy3-excitation and its colocalization
with the signal at the Cy3 channel (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref></xref>C). Direct excitation of Cy5 also produced
membrane-specific signal, but the background noise was much more significant.
In the case of control dye MemGraft-Cy3 (without biotin), a much weaker
signal was observed at the FRET channel, whereas in the direct Cy5
channel only background noise was observed. Another control experiment
with nonlabeled cells treated with strepatvidin-Cy5 showed no signal
from cell membranes in any of the studied channels (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c01134/suppl_file/au4c01134_si_001.pdf">Figure S16</ext-link>). These observations provide evidence of specific
attachment of streptavidin-Cy5 to the cells labeled with MemGraft-Cy3-biotin.
The latter leads to the close proximity of the Cy5 label with the
MemGraft-Cy3 part, leading to the observed FRET signal. In contrast,
a much weaker signal observed for the FRET signal with the control
MemGraft-Cy3 corresponds to the leakage of the Cy3 emission into the
Cy5 emission channel. It should be noted that direct Cy5 channel also
confirmed the attachment of streptavidin-Cy5 conjugate, but the quality
of the signal was much worse because, in this case, all streptavidin-Cy5
conjugates were excited, including those bound nonspecifically to
the glass surface. Thus, the FRET approach provides a more specific
signal of streptavidin-Cy5 fraction bound to the plasma membrane.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>(A)

cell-biotinylation
approach could be used for cell manipulation. To this end, we applied
streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, which are commonly used to separate
biotinylated molecules or cells from nonbiotinylated ones. In our
experimental setup, one cell population was labeled with MemGraft-Cy3-biotin,
while the other one was labeled with nonbiotinylated MemGraft-Cy5
(<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref></xref>D). Then,
the cells were detached and mixed together. This control conditions
gave two cell populations, corresponding to biotinylated cells stained
in cyan by MemGraft-Cy3-biotin and nonbiotinylated ones stained in
magenta by MemGraft-Cy5, as evidenced by two-color fluorescence imaging
(<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref></xref>E). In parallel,
the suspension of the two cell populations was exposed to a magnetic
field, which resulted in rapid precipitation of some fraction of cells,
which was isolated from the supernatant (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref></xref>D). Then, the isolated magnetized and remaining
(nonmagnetized) supernatant suspensions were deposited on glass slides
and imaged. Remarkably, the magnetized fraction showed predominantly
cyan color code of the cells, whereas the remaining nonmagnetized
suspension was stained in magenta (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref></xref>E). These experiments provided the proof
of concept of cell manipulation coupled to fluorescence imaging using
the MemGraft approach in combination with the biotin&#x02013;streptavidin
coupling strategy. The advantage of using MemGraft strategy is linked
to the higher labeling density, as it was evidenced from much more
efficient cell labeling by MemGraft compared to the classical NHS
labeling approach (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Moreover, the fluorescence
modality of MemGraft allows direct observation of cell surface modification
and its possible impact on the plasma membrane morphology by fluorescence
microscopy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Staining cell surface is generally done
by membrane probes that
target plasma membranes by hydrophobic noncovalent interactions. However,
this labeling is reversible and prone to dye exchange, which may lead
to a number of limitations caused by dye leakage into a biological
medium. Permanent (covalent) labeling of plasma membranes could address
these limitations but remains challenging. First, the right molecular
target for PM should be chosen for labeling. Natural lipids constituting
cell plasma membranes are not suitable for direct chemical modification,
unless metabolic labeling is used, which allows introduction of reactive
biorthogonal groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> However, this strategy
has limitations because lipids can still exchange with the biological
medium containing serum, and they are not compatible with fixation
and permeabilization. Robust labeling of cell surface that overcomes
limitations of lipids could be achieved by nonspecific labeling of
membrane proteins. However, robust techniques for protein labeling,
such as protein tag technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> and affinity-based labeling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> are designed to target specific proteins and not the whole population
present on the cell surface. Nonspecific labeling of cell surface
proteins by NHS esters or maleimides is rather inefficient, which
was confirmed in the present work using commercially available derivatives.
The latter can be explained by relatively slow reaction kinetics of
NHS esters amino groups of proteins and poor exposure of SH-groups
of membrane proteins outside the cells in the case of maleimides.
Therefore, these reagents require high dye concentrations and a rather
long reaction time, which leads to off-target labeling. In this work,
we propose a concept of the cell surface labeling based on lipid-directed
chemical grafting to membrane proteins. We use lipid anchors to favor
reversible interactions of the dye with lipid membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> in order to enhance its local concentration in the surrounding of
membrane proteins. In suspension of cells at concentration of 10<sup>5</sup> cells per 1 mL, the total lipid concentration on the outer
membrane leaflet of cells can be estimated as &#x0223c;0.33 &#x003bc;M
(assuming the cell diameter of 20 &#x003bc;m and area per lipid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup> of 0.6 nm<sup>2</sup>). Then, let us assume
that at 100 nM concentration of MemGraft, only 1% of the dye partitions
into cell plasma membranes due to its low affinity. Then, the local
dye concentration would correspond to &#x0223c;0.3 mol % vs lipids,
i.e., &#x0223c;4 mM vs lipids (assuming average molecular weight of
a lipid is 750 g/mol). This high local concentration can explain why
labeling of the cell surface is so efficient at low concentrations
of MemGraft (100 nM), in contrast to commercial derivatives, unable
to label cell membranes at these conditions. Limited reactivity of
amino-groups at the biomembrane surface for the commercial water-soluble
dye, like disulfo-Cy3-NHS, is also related to the neutral pH (7.4)
used for cell labeling, which leads to protonation (i.e., deactivation)
of water exposed amino groups. As sulfo-NHS-acetate inhibited cell
labeling by disulfo-Cy3-NHS, but not by MemGraft-Cy3, we concluded
that MemGraft can assess amino groups shielded from water at the membrane
interface. These amino groups are probably not protonated at neutral
pH and therefore more reactive than water-exposed amino groups, which
provides an additional explanation for the higher reactivity of MemGraft-Cy3
versus commercial disulfo-Cy3-NHS.</p><p>The other important challenge
in PM labeling is endocytosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref></sup> which results in rapid
internalization of labeled molecules inside
the cells. Endocytosis is typically observed for classical noncovalent
membrane probes, which show tendency to accumulate inside endosomes
over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref></sup> The same should concern probes that label
covalently membrane proteins. Our results indeed show that after labeling,
the MemGraft signal increases inside the cells in the perinuclear
regions corresponding to endosomes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>). However, it is remarkable to note that
even after 29 h of incubation, the major part of fluorescence is still
observed on the cell surface (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>). Taking in account that 50% of plasma membrane can
be internalized within &#x0223c;10 min,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref></sup> the observed PM labeling after 29 h suggest that the large fraction
of membrane proteins labeled by MemGraft was recycled to the cell
surface through intrinsic membrane recycling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">69</xref></sup> In this respect, our probes could be a powerful tool to study membrane
protein trafficking, recycling, and degradation.</p><p>We foresee
that the developed strategy will find direct applications
in a number of advanced fluorescence microscopy methods. Primarily,
the capacity of our probe to work in serum will enable long-term imaging
and tracking of cells in native conditions, which is currently done
using fluorescent nanoparticles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref></sup> Here, the main limitations will
be the cell division, which will systematically divide by two the
labeling level and eventual degradation of the membrane proteins after
multiple recycling processes. Second, availability of MemGraft in
multiple colors enables cell barcoding and tracking of multiple cell
populations. Here, we realized 5 barcoded populations based on two
dyes, and we expect that with addition of the third color, it will
be possible to make at least 13 color codes. Currently, the closest
technique that enable multicolor cell barcoding and imaging is Brainbow,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref></sup> a powerful tool to visualize organization and connections of neurons
in brain. However, our approach is simpler and does not require genetic
modification. The only direct methods for cell barcoding use combination
of fluorescent nanoparticles of different colors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">76</xref></sup> but they label endocytic vesicles and not the cell contour. The
covalent nature of labeling opens other multiple opportunities. Primarily,
it makes MemGraft compatible with fixation and permeabilization methods,
including standard immunostaining. Moreover, we expect that the capacity
of MemGraft probes to link covalently to membrane proteins could address
the problem of lateral diffusion of membrane probes in single-molecule
localization microscopy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> and thus allow imaging cell membranes with superior resolution.
Ultimately, we expect that MemGraft approach with appropriate fluorophores
will enable plasma membrane studies by advanced imaging methods such
as expansion microscopy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> tissue/animal clearing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> all requiring covalent labeling.</p><p>Biotinylated MemGraft introduces
additional functionality to our
grafting strategy beyond imaging. On the one hand, nonspecific labeling
of membrane proteins with biotin tag would enable proteomics analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">77</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref79">79</xref></sup> for example, to understand membrane protein trafficking. On the
other hand, our data on cell biotinylation by MemGraft strategy opens
the perspective of cell surface engineering,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref80">80</xref></sup> which enables functionalization of cell surface with synthetic molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref81">81</xref></sup> and biomolecules,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref82">82</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">84</xref></sup> for controlling and studying cell adhesion, cell&#x02013;cell
interactions, cell manipulation and delivery. We expect that the lipid-driven
covalent grafting strategy could facilitate introduction of functional
units to the surface of live cells, opening countless number of opportunities
in this rapidly expanding field.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Permanent labeling of cell plasma membranes
remains a challenge
because of the noncovalent nature of current fluorescent membrane
probes. Here, we report the concept of lipid-directed covalent labeling
of plasma membranes. We propose to exploit transient binding to the
biomembrane surface as a driving force creating a high local concentration
of the dye in proximity of membrane proteins, which can catalyze ligation
to membrane proteins. We designed a new family of dyes, named MemGraft,
based on a cyanine dye that bears a low-affinity membrane anchor and
an activated ester (or maleimide) on two ends of the dye. We found
that the low-affinity anchor plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient
PM labeling, as a control compound without this group failed to stain
PM. Moreover, MemGraft probes with activated ester and maleimide were
found to be superior to corresponding commercial NHS-ester and maleimide
Cy3-based labels. These data confirmed that the anchor ensures transient
binding to the plasma membrane that accelerates the labeling of amino
or thiol groups of membrane proteins in the proximity of lipid membranes.
The reactivity of the NHS-ester was found to be crucial, as less reactive
fluorophenyl activated esters showed strong internalization and inefficient
PM labeling. SDS-page confirmed that multiple membrane proteins were
labeled with MemGraft-Cy3 probes (with activated ester and maleimide),
thus confirming that our strategy of lipid-driven covalent labeling
of the cell surface operated through the nonselective conjugation
to the membrane proteins. In comparison to conventional noncovalent
staining of PM by reference probes (e.g., MemBright), the MemGraft
approach revealed several critical advantages: resistance to full
culture medium with serum in long-term cellular experiments and compatibility
with fixation and permeabilization. Additionally, these probes enabled
long-term labeling of cells and coculture of two cell populations
stained in different colors without dye exchange, which was not possible
before with conventional membrane probes. The latter allowed for imaging
of cell&#x02013;cell interactions and visualization of cell&#x02013;cell
contacts. Moreover, a combination of different ratios of MemGraft-Cy3
and MemGraft-Cy5 probes (NHS-esters) enabled long-term cell barcoding
in at least 5 color codes, which opens new opportunities in tracking
and visualizing multiple cell populations, similar to those offered
by &#x0201c;Brainbow&#x0201d; method, but without genetic modification
of the cells. Ultimately, based on the MemGraft strategy, we designed
a fluorescent probe for efficient biotinylation of the cell surface,
which enabled cell manipulation using streptavidin-coated magnetic
beads. The developed MemGraft concept opens a new chapter in the design
of advanced PM probes and, in a more general sense, proposes an efficient
approach for the covalent functionalization of any biomembrane surface
and cell surface engineering.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes-1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information
