</self-uri><abstract><p><italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">S.</italic>) <italic toggle="yes">aureus</italic> is a prominent foodborne pathogen that can cause food poisoning due to its staphylococcal toxins. Controlling the viable levels of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> is crucial for ensuring food safety. The detection of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> during routine quality control is still primarily conducted using traditional culture-based methods, which are time-consuming and unable to detect viable but non-culturable cells. Viability PCR (vPCR) &#x02013; a combination of traditional (or quantitative) PCR with photo-reactive DNA-intercalating dye(s) &#x02013; has been introduced as an alternative to detect viable cells by excluding those with compromised membranes using molecular methods. Despite the success of the vPCR methodology, avoiding false-positive results remains a significant challenge. To enhance the accuracy of vPCR results for <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, several approaches have been proposed by various researchers in the past decade; however, complete PCR signal suppression of dead cells has not been achieved. In this study, we developed a strategy to detect only viable <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> cells by combining double PMA treatment with a low PMA concentration and performing a tube change between the last dark incubation and light exposure to improve the vPCR protocol. For pure cultures, the optimized protocol was able to completely suppress DNA signals from 5.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>7</sup> dead cells in a final reaction volume of 200 &#x000b5;l. For artificially contaminated food samples with such a high dead cell count, complete PCR signal reduction was observed in ground pepper, - oregano, and infant milk powder, while ground paprika, - allspice, and - pork exhibited PCR signals close to the detection limit. To simulate conditions in real samples, we artificially contaminated ground paprika, - pork, and milk powder with a low number of viable cells (~1.9 cfu/ml) and a high number of heat-inactivated <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> (~4.8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10&#x02076; cells/ml). The results showed that the optimized protocol is effective in detecting only the desired live cells, even in the presence of a high dead cell count. Our findings highlight that vPCR can be an accurate and reliable method with strong potential for high-throughput detection of live <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> cells in certain food matrices.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Introduction</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>) is a Gram-positive, non-spore forming, facultative human pathogenic bacterium. Approximately 30% of the human population carries <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> as a nasal commensal [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> is also known to cause severe skin- and soft tissue infections [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] as well as staphylococcal food poisoning [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Food poisoning caused by ingestion of heat-stable staphylococcal enterotoxins is among the leading causes of foodborne outbreaks in the European Union [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Frequently positive tested foods include raw milk, dairy- and meat products. In condiments, <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> has rarely been detected [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> holds the potential to survive for months in low moisture foods due to its tolerance towards low a<sub>w</sub> levels [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, contaminated condiments might serve as a vehicle for transferring <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> to foods with optimal conditions for growth and toxin production.</p><p>In order to maintain high food safety standards, routine testing is highly relevant for the entire food production process, as well as for public authorities. For the assessment of microbial contamination and related hygienic standards, there are governmental regulations and recommendations. Depending on the specific food or food group, the guidance and critical values may vary. In the EU, food safety and process hygiene criteria are defined by the European Commission. For example: At the end of the manufacturing process, the concentration of coagulase-positive staphylococci in milk powder should not exceed a limit of 100 cfu/g. The analytical reference methods are the ISO 6888 series. The ISO 6888&#x02013;1 [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and -2 [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] standards are for direct plate count, while ISO 6888&#x02013;3 [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] is a method for enumeration of low levels and requires sample pre-enrichment before colony isolation. ISO 6888&#x02013;3 is also used to examine the presence or absence of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> in a single tube. Additionally, if samples indicate values over 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/g, the batch has to be tested for staphylococcal enterotoxin [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The culture-based method is considered the ideal approach for detecting microorganisms. However, it has several limitations and drawbacks, including inhibition of detection by certain matrices due to antimicrobial effects (e.g., cloves, oregano [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) or high microbial background levels, significant waste generated from duplicates and dilutions, as well as being labor-intensive and time-consuming. For instance, detection including confirmation of coagulase-positive staphylococci can take up to four days (ISO 6888&#x02013;1); if enrichment is required, this could take up to two days longer (ISO 6888&#x02013;3). Moreover, viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cells remain undetectable. These microorganisms are viable but cannot be cultured or grown under conventional laboratory conditions because they exist in a dormant state with low metabolic activity. The VBNC state is commonly adopted by microorganisms as a survival strategy in response to unfavorable or stressful conditions. Despite being non-culturable, VBNC cells can retain the potential to reactivate under certain environmental conditions, regaining their ability to be cultured, reactivating their metabolic functions, and restoring their capacity to cause infections and diseases, thus posing a significant threat to public health [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides an alternative approach for microorganism detection across various matrices. This rapid and highly sensitive method enables specific identification of target microorganisms through DNA amplification. The main drawback of the classical PCR is that it cannot differentiate between viable and dead populations or extracellular DNA, leading in an overestimation of actual viable cell count [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>To overcome this issue, viability PCR (vPCR) has been introduced to exclude free DNA and DNA from cells with compromised membranes [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which are considered to be dead cells. The concept of vPCR is quite simple: By adding a photoactive DNA-intercalating dye such as ethidium monoazide (EMA) or propidium monoazide (PMA) to the sample prior to the DNA extraction, the dye enters the compromised cells and intercalates into the DNA. The samples are then exposed to bright visible light to photo-activate the dye. Photolysis converts the azide group of the dye into a highly reactive nitrene radical, which forms a non-reversible covalent bond with the DNA, rendering it inaccessible to the polymerase. As a result, DNA from compromised cells is excluded from amplification during the PCR [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>vPCR has been applied to detect a wide spectrum of various food relevant microorganisms including <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, vPCR also has its own set of advantages, challenges and limitations, as demonstrated in many studies, which are summarized in detailed reviews by Fittipaldi et al. and Codony et al. In summary, the success of vPCR depends on several key factors such as dye type and concentration, dye incubation conditions (temperature and time), light source and photoactivation time, microorganism and matrix type, as well as PCR amplification conditions (e.g., amplificon length, temperature and time) [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The key limitation of the vPCR method lies in the fact that differentiation between viable and dead cells is based solely on membrane integrity. As PMA can only penetrate cells with damaged membranes, cell monitoring after disinfection using methods that do not directly affect membrane permeability (e.g., UV treatment) is not possible [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Due to the strong dependency of vPCR on cell membrane status, VBNC cells can be detected, but not &#x0201c;ghost cells&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Despite numerous efforts in recent years to optimize vPCR protocols for these critical factors (e.g., applying reagent enhancers, using a dye mix, changing reaction tubes, double photo-activation or double dye treatment), residual PCR signals from dead cells are still commonly observed, especially in samples with high dead cell count [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, in some cases, complete signal reduction at high dead cell concentrations could be achieved by applying a combination of different approaches [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although available optimization protocols have successfully reduced the PCR signal of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> to a significant extent, complete PCR signal suppression of dead cell population has not yet been achieved [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Consequently, these protocols would still overestimate the actual cell count of viable cells and thus are not reliable for routine quality control testing, especially when evaluating the effectiveness of decontamination.</p><p>The aim of our study is to optimize vPCR for the detection of viable <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> despite high dead cell concentrations (up to 10<sup>7</sup> cfu/ml). By combining different approaches, we developed a robust vPCR protocol capable of exclusively detecting live <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> in pure cultures. In a simulation, we artificially contaminated ground paprika, - pork, and milk powder with a low number of viable (~2 cfu/ml) and a high number of heat-inactivated (~10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml) <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> cells and could demonstrate that the optimized protocol is capable of detecting only the desired live cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>2.

Discussion and conclusion</title><sec id="sec023"><title>4.1. vPCR protocol improvement</title><p>vPCR is theoretically a rapid, sensitive, and reliable method for detecting viable cells by excluding membrane-compromised cells (a conservative definition of dead cells). However, practical experience has raised concerns about its effectiveness, particularly due to the incomplete suppression of PCR signals, which can lead to false-positive results &#x02013; especially when there is a high background of dead cells. This limitation has hindered its widespread use in routine quality control. Consequently, several efforts have been made to improve the ability of vPCR to specifically detect live cells.</p><p>EMA has been shown to be less selective than PMA, particularly for <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>. Nocker et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] demonstrated visually that EMA can enter live <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> cells, whereas PMA does not affect live cells. EMA is based on ethidium bromide (which carries one positive charge) and an azide group, while PMA is based on propidium iodide (which carries two positive charges) coupled with an azide group. The azide group is responsible for covalent binding to DNA. The higher positive charge on PMA likely contributes to its greater impermeability through intact cell membranes [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which is why we use PMA for our vPCR protocol.</p><p>The efficacy of PMA is based on membrane integrity: intact membranes in viable cells act as a barrier to the dye, whereas PMA can penetrate dead cells with damaged membranes and crosslink with their DNA upon light activation. Since some killing methods (e.g., UV radiation) do not directly affect cell membranes, heat treatment is commonly used to obtain dead bacterial cells for demonstrating vPCR potential [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] evaluated various heat treatment conditions and proposed 80 &#x000b0;C for 20&#x02009;min as the optimal condition to kill cells without releasing DNA. We adopted the same heat-treatment condition to produce dead cells with destabilized membranes, and heat treatment at 80 &#x000b0;C for 20&#x02009;min successfully inactivated the cells without detectable DNA release (as evidenced by similar PCR signals between live and dead cells in <xref rid="pone.0324819.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>One key factor for the success of PMA treatment is the PMA concentration and exposure time. PMA shows a dose-response effect, which was demonstrated by applying a tenfold serial dilution of PMA (ranging from 0.05 &#x000b5;M to 50 &#x000b5;M) to 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml dead <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Many optimization approaches have involved concentrations between 1 &#x000b5;M and 50 &#x000b5;M, sometimes up to 100 &#x000b5;M [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In our study, we tested various PMA concentrations (1&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;M) under different treatment procedures and dark incubation times to determine the optimal conditions.</p><p>With a single treatment, PMA concentrations of 10 &#x000b5;M and 25 &#x000b5;M were most effective in suppressing the PCR signals from 3.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>7</sup> dead cells, yielding ~4.6 log&#x02081;&#x02080; genome unit (GU) reduction. Increasing the PMA concentration up to 100 &#x000b5;M did not further suppress the PCR signal from dead cells. These findings are consistent with Chang and Lin [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], who reported 3.1&#x02013;3.8 log&#x02081;&#x02080; reduction using 2.4&#x02013;37.3 &#x000b5;M PMA under comparable conditions (albeit with 5&#x02009;min dark incubation and 20&#x02009;min light exposure using a 500-W halogen lamp), and no additional suppression at higher PMA concentrations. Chang and Lin also systematically evaluated varying PMA concentrations (2.4, 3.7, 16.2, and 37.3 &#x000b5;M) on serial dilutions of live or dead cells (ranging from 10&#x000b3; to 10<sup>7</sup> cfu/ml), finding that complete suppression of the PCR signal from dead cells was achievable only up to 10&#x02075; cells/ml. For higher dead cell counts, the signal could be substantially reduced but not completely neutralized [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Complete signal reduction for high dead cell counts by single PMA treatment (16.2 &#x000b5;M PMA with 5&#x02009;min dark incubation and 5&#x02009;min light exposure using a 500-W halogen lamp) was reported by Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], although their use of traditional PCR (agarose gel) resulted in a relatively high LOD (10&#x02074; cfu/ml). In contrast, real-time PCR typically achieves an LOD of 10&#x000b2; cfu/ml, making it unclear whether dead cell DNA was completely neutralized under those conditions.</p><p>At low PMA concentrations, as shown by Codony et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], a linear dependency exists between PMA concentration and suppression efficiency. However, it seems like beyond a certain concentration, a plateau near the LOD is reached &#x02013; especially in the presence of a high background of dead cells &#x02013; where further increases in PMA concentration do not yield additional suppression [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In our study with <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, this plateau began at approximately 10 &#x000b5;M PMA. With the standard protocol (single treatment with 5&#x02009;min dark incubation followed by 5&#x02013;15&#x02009;min of light exposure), none of the tested conditions completely suppressed the DNA signal from high dead cell counts below the LOD.</p><p>Regarding live cell samples, our data showed that single PMA treatment had only a moderate effect on treated live cells &#x02013; resulting in C<sub>t</sub> values roughly 1 cycle higher than untreated live cells. This slight increase may be partly due to a naturally occurring fraction of compromised or dead cells in the population. This notion is supported by studies such as Stewart et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] on aging and death of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and Y&#x000e1;&#x000f1;ez et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] on the effects of PMA on exponentially growing <italic toggle="yes">Legionella pneumophila</italic>. In the latter study, qPCR results without PMA pre-treatment yielded approximately one log&#x02081;&#x02080; higher cell counts than plate counts, whereas qPCR coupled with PMA pre-treatment produced results similar to those obtained by plating.</p><p>Kobayashi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] reported that a concentration of 50 &#x000b5;M PMA caused the C<sub>t</sub> value of live <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> cells (~10&#x02075; cfu/ml) to drop by around 2 cycles. Chang and Lin [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] observed a similarly low effect for high cell counts (10&#x02078; cfu/ml), however, a significantly stronger effect was observed for lower live cell counts (10&#x02076; cfu/ml and below) when PMA concentrations of 16.2 &#x000b5;M or higher were used. They proposed 2.4 or 3.7 &#x000b5;M PMA as the optimal concentration for suppressing dead cell DNA amplification while minimally affecting live cell signals. In contrast, for species such as <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, high PMA concentrations did not significantly impact live cell counts [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These findings underscore the importance of optimizing PMA concentration on a species-specific basis to avoid underestimation of live cells and overestimation of dead cells.</p><p>The main challenge when using PMA is enhancing its permeability to dead cells to maximize PCR signal reduction [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To address this, many optimization approaches have incorporated membrane-destabilizing agents. However, for <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, none of the protocols combining a detergent or surfactant with a single PMA treatment fully eliminated the PCR signal from dead cells [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For instance, Zi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported that in dead cells, the &#x02206;C<sub>t</sub> between samples treated with Triton X-100 and those treated with PBS alongside 10 &#x000b5;M PMA was only 1.5 cycles, whereas the &#x02206;C<sub>t</sub> between treated and untreated live cells was 4 cycles. In our opinion, this trade-off is too substantial to be considered effective.</p><p>For species like <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, where high PMA concentrations do not significantly affect live cell counts, combining high PMA concentrations with tube changes and double light treatment seems promising. For <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> (using a dye blend), complete signal reduction was achieved in 3 of 4 samples containing 10<sup>7</sup> dead cells/ml [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For <italic toggle="yes">Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, the new protocol resulted in a &#x02206;C<sub>t</sub> of 3.7 cycles compared to the traditional protocol [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Since a high PMA concentration of 50 &#x000b5;M is not optimal for <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, double light treatment might not be appropriate.

The increased C<sub>t</sub> values may be due to free DNA adhering to the tube walls [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], making it inaccessible to PMA.

They tested various primers resulting in amplicon lengths ranging from 65 to 260&#x02009;bp and 75&#x02013;417&#x02009;bp, respectively, and demonstrated that longer amplicons led to greater PCR signal suppression in PMA-treated samples compared to shorter ones. Therefore, we chose a primer pair that produces an amplicon of 255&#x02009;bp [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p></list-item></list><p>By combining a double treatment with 10 &#x000b5;M PMA (each with 5&#x02009;min dark incubation and 5&#x02009;min light exposure) and a tube change between the last dark and light exposure, we found an optimal approach to suppress the PCR signal from 10<sup>7</sup> dead cells to below the LOD (10&#x000b2; cells/sample). Interestingly, double treatment with 25 &#x000b5;M PMA did not produce the same result, regardless of whether the incubation time was 5 or 15&#x02009;min. The reason might be due to the short light inactivation time, as a sufficient light dose is required for complete photolysis of PMA. Codony et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] calculated that for 50 &#x000b5;M PMA, an exposure time of at least 15&#x02009;min is needed. Our protocol&#x02019;s 5-minutes exposure might be too short to inactivate all PMA molecules. Nocker et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] also noted that with increasing PMA concentration, the light exposure time needs to be increased to promote complete photolysis. This could also explain why the efficiency in reducing the PCR signal from dead cells starts to decrease at concentrations higher than 50 &#x000b5;M. Given that our protocol is both quick and effective, we did not further investigate variations in light treatment.</p><p>The benefit of double treatment was most evident at 1 &#x000b5;M PMA: while a single treatment with 1 &#x000b5;M PMA reduced the PCR signal of dead cells by only 6.4 &#x02206;C<sub>t</sub> (~1.7 log&#x02081;&#x02080; GU), double treatment increased this suppression to 12.2 &#x02206;C<sub>t</sub> (~3.3 log&#x02081;&#x02080; GU reduction). The difference between double treatment with 10 or 25 &#x000b5;M PMA compared to single treatment was up to 3 cycles; however, these differences were not statistically significant. In both single and double treatments with 10 or 25 &#x000b5;M PMA, C<sub>t</sub> values were already close to the LOD. Moreover, the effect of dark incubation time was notable: by increasing the dark-exposure time from 1&#x02009;min to 5 or 15&#x02009;min, double treatment with 10 &#x000b5;M PMA completely suppressed the PCR signal from 10<sup>7</sup> dead cells per sample to below the LOD.</p><p>In summary, the optimized protocol reliably detects live cell counts, even in the presence of a high background of dead cells (<xref rid="pone.0324819.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), with only a slight effect on live cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>4.2. Detection of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> in food samples</title><p>Food samples are complex matrices that can affect the efficacy of vPCR. The interaction of PMA with organic and inorganic compounds, as well as a potentially high number of dead cells, may reduce the available dye concentration.

Our contamination level of 2.7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10&#x02078; cells/ml (~10&#x02079; cells/g) exceeds the highest reported microbial loads in spices (up to 8 log&#x02081;&#x02080; cfu/g of aerobic mesophilic bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]), demonstrating the robustness of the vPCR approach.</p><p>While the protocol was effective in several matrices, residual PCR signals from dead cells were detected in ground allspice, -paprika, and -pork. Turbidity, and reduced dye availability might be potential factors contributing to the incomplete signal suppression. For effective vPCR, a clear solution is crucial for photolysis. However, paprika&#x02019;s red pigments and similar components in allspice cannot be removed through simple centrifugation-based washing, potentially hindering complete PMA photolysis. Furthermore, only larger particles were removed during washing, while smaller suspended particles remained and may hinder PMA penetration into the dead cells. These spice particles may also reduce available PMA molecules due to non-specific binding. A further factor that might affect the PMA-to-DNA stoichiometry is the high autochthonous microbial load in the spices used [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. According to Codony et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], 5 &#x000b5;M PMA theoretically contains enough molecules to neutralize 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml; however, because PMA interacts not only with DNA but also with other organic molecules in the cell and the food matrix, a higher concentration may be required. Since higher PMA concentrations negatively affect live cells, incorporating a third PMA treatment might resolve the PMA-to-DNA ratio issue.</p><p>Detection of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> in spices and herbs using PCR is generally challenging due to the presence of PCR inhibitors in these matrices. Cabicarov&#x000e1; et al. [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] demonstrated that a washing step with a solution containing Triton X-100 can improve detection sensitivity. Particularly when enrichment is involved, washing is necessary to reduce growth-inhibitory factors, allowing <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> to grow. While washing is necessary to reduce inhibitors and turbidity, washing can cause cell loss &#x02013; especially in ground matrices with high surface areas. Bacteria attached to removed rough particles may be lost, likely contributed to the elevated C<sub>t</sub> values observed for both treated and untreated live cells in spice samples. A further explanation for the elevated C<sub>t</sub> values might be the presence of PCR inhibitors in the spices [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Incorporation of an internal amplification control is therefore recommended when working with spices.</p><p>Given that the contamination levels used in our study are likely higher than those encountered in real-world conditions, this test primarily serves as a theoretical evaluation.

The aims were: (1) to assess the efficacy of the protocol in suppressing the PCR signal of 10&#x02076; dead cells/ml (~10<sup>7</sup> cells/g), and (2) to assess the protocol&#x02019;s ability to accurately detect viable cell counts that naturally increase during enrichment.

Conclusion</title><p>The optimized vPCR has effectively and reliably suppressed signals from high dead cell counts of 10<sup>7</sup> cells/sample in pure cultures and 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in food samples (heat-killed) below the LOD. Therefore, our proposed vPCR protocol showed high potential to detect <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> in certain routine analysis cases (e.g., for excluding dead cells inactivated by methods affecting the membrane or lysed due to long-term storage). However, in contrast to culture-based methods, the proposed vPCR protocol needs to be adapted depending on the matrix being tested. For quantitative detection of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, further optimizations, such as establishing an internal PCR control, are required. Since this protocol is optimized to suppress PCR signals from high dead cell counts, it may not be suitable for use at low cell levels. To gain long-term experience regarding the robustness of the vPCR method, it is recommended to conduct traditional culture methods in parallel. For routine application, conducting a method comparison study in accordance with ISO 16140&#x02013;2 [<xref rid="pone.0324819.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] is recommended. Alternatively, vPCR could be used as a preliminary screening method, with only samples displaying a PCR signal undergoing further investigation through culture-based reference methods (ISO 6888&#x02013;1, or -2).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge support by the Open Access Publication Fund of Freie Universit&#x000e4;t Berlin.
