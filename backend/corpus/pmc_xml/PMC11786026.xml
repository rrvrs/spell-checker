Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), a mechanosensitive calcium channel, regulates angiogenesis and stromal stiffness in various tumors. However, it is unclear whether matrix stiffness regulates the invasiveness of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells through TRPV4. In this study, we found that increased matrix stiffness of NPC tissues correlated with advanced tumor stages. Furthermore, simulation of high matrix stiffness <italic>in vitro</italic> upregulated TRPV4, and increased the migration, invasion, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NPC cells. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of TRPV4 significantly suppressed the calcium influx in NPC cells, and inhibited their invasiveness and EMT under high-stiffness conditions. Mechanistically, TRPV4 modulated the invasiveness of NPC cells in response to matrix stiffness via the NOX4/IL-8 axis. Notably, TRPV4 and IL-8 levels were significantly increased in the high-stiffness NPC tissues, and showed a positive correlation. Taken together, matrix stiffness promotes the malignant progression of NPC cells through the activation of the TRPV4/NOX4/IL-8 axis, which could be explored further as a potential target for NPC therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Matrix stiffness</kwd><kwd>TRPV4</kwd><kwd>NOX4</kwd><kwd>tumorigenesis</kwd><kwd>NPC</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) are epithelial tumors that originate from the mucosal tissues in the nasopharynx <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, particularly the anterior parietal wall and the pharyngeal crypts in the lateral wall. The incidence of NPC is especially higher in southern China and Southeast Asia <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, and the risk factors include genetic susceptibility, EBV infection, environmental triggers and dietary habits <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. At present, the clinical management of NPC relies on radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. However, due to their obscure anatomical location, NPCs are often difficult to detect at the early stages, and many patients are diagnosed at the middle or late stage of the disease, leading to poor prognosis. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the mechanisms underlying NPC development and identify new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.</p><p><bold>M</bold>atrix stiffness is a characteristic feature of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Under normal physiological conditions, the extracellular matrix (ECM) has a certain degree of stiffness to maintain the normal structure and function of tissues. However, matrix stiffness increases significantly during tumor formation and progression, which allows the tumor cells to proliferate, migrate and invade. Furthermore, changes in the ECM can activate the pro-oncogenic genes and pathways, thus promoting tumor progression. For instance, the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in oral tumors increase matrix stiffness by producing LOX, which in turn promotes cancer progression through the FAK phosphorylation pathway <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well, increased stromal stiffness is known to promote neo-angiogenesis <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Furthermore, high matrix stiffness in the NPC environment accelerates cell migration, invasion, and the formation of invasive pseudopods, and is closely related to prognosis <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. The NPC stroma becomes progressively denser and stiffer as the tumor grows, which has a significant impact on the efficacy of radiation therapy <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. However, the mechanisms underlying matrix stiffness in NPC have not been fully clarified.</p><p>Matrix stiffness can induce intracellular receptors or sensors, such as TRPV4, that modulate cellular behavior. Knocking down TRPV4 in human epidermal keratinocytes has been shown to prevent excessive stiffening of the ECM <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. TRPV4 is a calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) permeable non-selective cation channel <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> that controls angiogenesis by acting on the tumor endothelial cells, and is associated with matrix stiffness. It is activated by various physical factors, including temperature, pressure, mechanical forces, osmolality, and ultraviolet light <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Recent studies have shown that TRPV4 is aberrantly expressed in cancers <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. In a previous study, we had shown that TRPV4 promotes NPC progression through NFAT4 signaling <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. However, TRPV4 activation has not been investigated in the response of NPC cells to matrix stiffness, and the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in tumor formation, progression, and metastasis. For instance, ROS production significantly affects the proliferation and migration ability of pancreatic cancer cells, and mediates the progression of NPC through AKT/mTOR signaling <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. TRPV4 activation enhances mitochondrial ROS production in response to cellular stress due to increased calcium influx <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. ROS is primarily generated during oxidative phosphorylation by the NADPH oxidase (NOX) family and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. High NOX expression is associated with increased ROS production, leading to oxidative stress. We had previously shown that up-regulation of TRPV4 in obese mice enhanced NOX-mediated ROS generation and increased vascular permeability <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. However, it is unclear whether the TRPV4/NOX axis is involved in matrix stiffness-dependent progression of NPC.</p><p>In this study, we observed higher matrix stiffness in the advanced stage NPC tissues, which correlated with increased TRPV4 expression and metastasis. Furthermore, downregulation or pharmacological inhibition of TRPV4 significantly inhibited matrix stiffness-induced migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NPC cells through the NOX4/IL-8 axis. Overall, our study indicates that matrix stiffness regulates the aggressiveness of NPC tumors via the TRPV4/NOX4/IL-8 axis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec><title>Drugs</title><p>GSK1016790A (HY-19608), HC-067047 (HY-100208), apocynin (HY-N0088) and GLX351322 (HY-100111) were purchased from MedChemExpress.

The T3-4 stage tumors showed an increase in matrix stiffness compared to the tumors of T1-2 stages (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A-B). Furthermore, the N2-3 stage tumors had a higher level of matrix stiffness (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C-D). Based on the percentage of collagen fibers, the NPC specimens were classified as low-stiffness (score 0 to 2) and high-stiffness (score 3 to 4). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E-G, the high-stiffness tissues expressed higher levels of TRPV4 protein compared to the low-stiffness tissues. To simulate matrix stiffness <italic>in vitro</italic>, we cultured NPC cells at 0.2 kPa (low stiffness) and 25 kPa (high stiffness). TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in cells subjected to 25 kPa compared to the cells cultured at 0.2 kPa (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>H-I). Taken together, our findings suggest that higher matrix stiffness correlates with advanced clinical stage in NPC, which may increase TRPV4 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Matrix stiffness promotes invasiveness and EMT of NPC cells</title><p>In order to explore the role of matrix stiffness in the invasive behavior of NPC cells, we cultured the 5-8F and CNE1 cells under low- and high-stiffness conditions, and analyzed their migration and invasion in transwell assays. The NPC cells grown at 25 kPa exhibited higher migration and invasion rates compared to the cells subjected to 0.2 kPa (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A-B). NPC cells cultured on high stiffness surfaces also had stronger adhesion and detachment abilities compared to the low-stiffness counterparts (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E-F). To explore the possible regulatory mechanisms underlying matrix stiffness, we examined the expression levels of EMT-related markers.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>G-H, the epithelial marker E-cadherin was downregulated, while the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin were upregulated in NPC cell lines under high-stiffness conditions, which is indicative of accelerated EMT. Collectively, our results demonstrated that matrix stiffness can increase the invasiveness and metastatic ability of NPC cells by promoting EMT.</p></sec><sec><title>TRPV4 regulates matrix stiffness-induced invasiveness and EMT in NPC cells</title><p>To explore the functional relevance of TRPV4, we measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in the NPC cells grown under high- and low-stiffness conditions using Fluo-4/AM staining. Following stimulation with the TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx increased significantly in the high-stiffness condition group compared to the low-stiffness condition group (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A-C). On the other hand, TRPV4 knockdown suppressed the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induced by GSK1016790A under high-stiffness conditions (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D-F and Supplementary <xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Figure S1</xref>). Likewise, pharmacological inhibition of TRPV4 using HC-067047 effectively inhibited GSK1016790A-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>G-I). Thus, TRPV4 may exert its biological effects on NPC cells with high matrix stiffness through the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of TRPV4 significantly reduced the migration and invasion abilities of NPC cells under high-stiffness conditions (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A-D), and impaired their adhesion and detachment (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E-H). Consistent with this, knockdown or blockade of TRPV4 increased the relative expression of E-cadherin and decreased that of vimentin and N-cadherin (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>I-L). Taken together, these results suggest that TRPV4 regulates the matrix stiffness-induced invasiveness and EMT of NPC cells.</p></sec><sec><title>The TRPV4/NOX4/IL-8 axis is critical for matrix stiffness-induced invasiveness and EMT in NPC cells</title><p>To further investigate the downstream effectors of TRPV4, we measured ROS production in the NPC cells using the CM-H2DCFDA probe. Interestingly, TRPV4 activation in NPC cells with high-stiffnesss condition under enhanced ROS production (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A-B), while pharmacological inhibition of TRPV4 (HC067047) or NOX (apocynin) suppressed GSK1016790A-induced ROS production (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A-B), indicating that TRPV4 may regulate ROS levels through NOX. Apocynin, a broad-spectrum NOX inhibitor, significantly attenuated the migration and EMT of NPC cells grown under high-stiffness conditions (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C-E). The NOX4 antagonist GLX351322 showed similar inhibitory effects (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F-H). Based on these results, we hypothesized that matrix stiffness in NPC may promote migration and EMT through the TRPV4-NOX4 axis.</p><p>NPC cells grown under high-stiffness conditions showed significant upregulation of IL-8 mRNA, and also secreted high levels of the cytokine (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A-B). Therefore, we next investigated whether the TRPV4/NOX4 axis also regulates IL-8 production in response to matrix stiffness. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C, blocking TRPV4 or Nox4 significantly reduced IL-8 RNA expression and secretion. Furthermore, IL-8 knockdown significantly decreased the adhesion and detachment abilities of the NPC cells (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E-F and Supplementary <xref rid="SM0" ref-type="sec">Figure S2</xref>), and suppressed EMT (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>G-H) compared to the control group. To further validate the effector role of IL-8 in the TRPV4/NOX4 axis, we treated NPC cells with the TRPV4 inhibitor HC067047 and recombinant IL-8. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A-B, IL-8 reversed the inhibitory effect of TRPV4 blockade on the adhesion and detachment abilities of NPC cells with high-stiffnesss condition. Consistent with this, pre-treatment with IL-8 also promoted EMT following TRPV4 inhibition (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C-D). Likewise, IL-8 also enhanced the adhesion, detachment and EMT of NPC cells under high-stiffnesss condition with NOX4 inhibition (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E-H). Finally, immunostaining of NPC tissue specimens showed that the in-situ IL-8 protein expression was significantly increased in the high-stiffness NPC tissues (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>I-J). In addition, IL-8 expression correlated positively with the expression of TRPV4 (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>K). Together, our findings suggest that matrix stiffness mediates the invasiveness of NPC cells via the TRPV4/NOX4/IL-8 axis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The tumor stroma exhibits increased stiffness due to changes in the cell types and ECM <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, which in turn drives cancer progression <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. For instance, the stiffness of breast tumors stimulates the invasion and metastasis of the malignant cells <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Similarly, tumor stiffness can drive the EMT of prostate cancer cells <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Consistent with these findings, the stiffness of NPC tissue specimens increased with the progression of tumor stage. Furthermore, the expression levels of TRPV4 were significantly increased in the high-stiffness NPC tissues, as well as in NPC cells cultured at 25 kPa to simulate matrix stiffness. TRPV4 is a non-selective cation channel that is highly sensitive to calcium ions <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, and can be activated by multiple physiological and pathological stimuli, such as temperature, pressure, biochemical stimuli and osmotic pressure. Activation of TRPV4 increases calcium influx, and high intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels regulate various biological processes <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Previous studies have shown that tumor stiffness activates TRPV4 and induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which can further alter matrix stiffness by modulating the cytoskeleton and enzyme activities <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. TRPV4 was involved in mediating stiffness-induced foreign body response and giant cell formation <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. TRPV4 regulated breast cancer cell extravasation and stiffness by controlling the cytoskeleton at the cell cortex <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. In our study, TRPV4-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was markedly increased in the high-stiffness NPC cells. Pharmacological inhibition or gene-silencing of TRPV4 suppressed the matrix stiffness-induced invasiveness of NPC cells <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. This led us to hypothesize that matrix stiffness regulates invasiveness of NPC cells by mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity through TRPV4. Consistent with our findings, tumor stiffness promotes the proliferation of oral cancer cells by mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPV4 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Furthermore, TRPV4 regulates the cytoskeleton of endometrial cancer cells through the RhoA/ROCK1 pathway, thereby promoting metastasis <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>.</p><p>Pre-treatment with TRPV4 agonists increased the production of intracellular ROS in NPC cells grown under high-stiffness conditions. ROS or free radicals are highly active molecules that play a dual role in living organisms <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. Under normal physiological conditions, appropriate levels of ROS mediate various cellular activities and immune responses. However, excessive ROS production causes oxidative damage to tissues, which has been linked to tumorigenesis and progression. For instance, high levels of ROS regulate the EMT and apoptosis of oral cancer cells, thus promoting tumor progression <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Likewise, aberrant ROS production correlates with therapy resistance of HCC cells <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. We found that inhibiting ROS production in the NPC cells by blocking NOX4 decreased the invasiveness induced by matrix stiffness. In a previous study, we had shown that the TRPV4/NOX2 axis promoted vascular permeability in obese mice by inducing ROS generation <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. Accordingly, we hypothesized that matrix stiffness may regulate the invasiveness and EMT of NPC cells through the TRPV4/NOX4 axis.</p><p>IL-8 is a pro-inflammatory CXC chemokine that promotes tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, and is associated with poor prognosis in NPC <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. Previous studies have shown that the production of IL-8 is dependent on ROS generation <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that IL-8 may function downstream of the TRPV4/NOX4 axis. Indeed, NPC cells grown under high-stiffness conditions showed elevated IL-8 mRNA expression and also secreted higher levels of IL-8. Moreover, knocking down IL-8 significantly decreased the adhesion, detachment and EMT of the high-stiffness NPC cells. Additionally, pre-treatment with IL-8 rescued the inhibitory effect of TRPV4/NOX4 blockade on the invasiveness of NPC cells. Both TRPV4 and NOX4 levels were significantly higher in the high-stiffness NPC specimens, and showed a positive correlation. Moreover, IL-8 signaling was reported as one of the most important altered pathways in NPC, our findings may partly explain the unstisfying response to chemo/immunoherapies. Targeting TRPV4/NOX4/IL-8 axis may be a potential strategy for combining chemo/immunoherapies. Nevertheless, future studies are needed to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Matrix stiffness can regulate the invasive behavior of NPC cells through the TRPV4/NOX4/IL-8 signaling axis. Advanced clinical stage of NPC is associated with increased matrix stiffness and overexpression of TRPV4 and IL-8. Our findings suggest that the TRPV4/Nox4/IL-8 axis is a promising target for NPC therapy.</p></sec><sec id="SM0" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supplementary figures and tables.</p></caption><media xlink:href="jcav16p1324s1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2021A1515010970); Shenzhen Innovation of Science and Technology Commission (No. JCYJ20230807091702005, JCYJ20210324132407019); Longgang Innovation of Science and Technology Commission (LGKCYLWS2022002, LGKCYLWS2021000027); Shenzhen Key Medical Discipline Construction Fund (No. SZXK039); Longgang Medical Discipline Construction Fund (Key Medica Discipline in Longgang District).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>LL</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>YP</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>CB</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>MY</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>NY</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>XZ</given-names></name><etal/><article-title>The Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma</article-title><source>Cancer Commun (Lond)</source><year>2021</year><volume>41</volume><fpage>1195</fpage><lpage>227</lpage>
