Increasing evidence supports that PRMTs exhibit the capacity to form higher-order oligomeric structures, but the structural basis of PRMT oligomerization and its functional consequence are elusive. Herein, we revealed for the first time different oligomeric structural forms of the predominant arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 using cryo-EM, which included tetramer (dimer of dimers), hexamer (trimer of dimers), octamer (tetramer of dimers), decamer (pentamer of dimers), and also helical filaments. Through a host of biochemical assays, we showed that PRMT1 methyltransferase activity was substantially enhanced as a result of the high-ordered oligomerization. High-ordered oligomerization increased the catalytic turnover and the multimethylation processivity of PRMT1. Presence of a catalytically dead PRMT1 mutant also enhanced the activity of WT PRMT1, pointing out a noncatalytic role of oligomerization. Structural modeling demonstrates that oligomerization enhances substrate retention at the PRMT1 surface through electrostatic force. Our studies offered key insights into PRMT1 oligomerization and established that oligomerization constitutes a novel molecular mechanism that positively regulates the enzymatic activity of PRMTs in biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>PRMT1</kwd><kwd>protein arginine methyltransferase</kwd><kwd>arginine methylation</kwd><kwd>oligomerization</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>protein structure</kwd><kwd>enzyme activity regulation</kwd><kwd>molecular modeling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term id="kwrd0055">CPM</term><def><p>counts per minute</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0065">DLS</term><def><p>dynamic light scattering</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0075">PRMT</term><def><p>protein arginine methyltransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0085">SEC</term><def><p>size-exclusion chromatography</p></def></def-item></def-list><notes><p id="misc0010">Reviewed by members of the JBC Editorial Board.

The family of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) consists of nine enzyme members, each classified as type-I, II, or III enzyme, depending on the nature of the methylated arginine products generated by the catalytic process (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). All PRMTs are capable of producing monomethylarginine by transferring the methyl group from the methyl donor, SAM, to the guanidino nitrogen of arginine. Type I PRMTs can further catalyze the transfer of a second methyl group onto the same &#x003c9;-nitrogen atom to create asymmetric dimethylarginines. On the contrary, type II PRMTs catalyze transferring the second methyl group on to the different terminal &#x003c9;-nitrogen atom to form symmetric dimethylarginine. Type III PRMT, with PRMT7 being the only member, catalyzes the formation of monomethylarginine but is unable to catalyze the second methylation event. The dysregulation of PRMTs is of great biomedical significance for a variety of diseases (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In oncology, PRMTs have been evidenced to associate with all stages of cancer development: initiation, progression, and metastasis (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). While many studies have been conducted elaborating on phenotypical manifestations of PRMT changes in health and disease, there is a clear demand for structural and biochemical investigations to uncover how PRMTs are regulated at the molecular level. Such information is especially critical to aid the design of small molecule drugs targeting PRMTs.</p><p id="p0015">It is well established that the homodimerization of PRMTs is an absolute requirement for their catalytic activity (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The homodimeric architecture creates a bowl-like ring shape where the dimerization arm of one subunit interacts with the opposite subunit of the dimer. The diminishing of the dimerization arm of PRMT1 depletes the methylation activity of PRMT1 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Except for the dimerization, a few studies have pointed that PRMTs, including PRMT1, are capable of oligomerizing to form higher order homo-oligomeric architectures (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The X-ray crystal structure of yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> PRMT1 (Hmt1) demonstrates a hexameric structure (a trimer of dimers) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), although such a structure has not been found in any PRMTs in other species. By chemical crosslinking, we previously found that PRMT1 exists in different oligomer forms and oligomerization is concentration-dependent and biochemical analysis showed that PRMT1 activity increases as a result of the oligomerization, though the mechanism is unknown (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). These conclusions about PRMT1 oligomerization was independently proved later by Toma-Fukai et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The Hevel group showed PRMT1 predominantly exists as a tetramer using native gel electrophoresis and analytical ultracentrifugation, supporting the oligomerization process of PRMT1 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Our previously resolved X-ray crystallographic structure of PRMT8 shows that it exists as a tetramer form (a dimer of dimers) and the &#x003b2;15 strand plays a vital role in the assembly of the tetramer (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The tetramer form of PRMT8 was also confirmed in size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and analytical ultracentrifugation studies. Interestingly, an independent study showed that human PRMT8 can form octamers and even helical filaments (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Despite these studies, there have been no structural information to date that holistically address different forms of PRMT oligomerization and no clear mechanistic understanding has emerged of PRMT oligomerization and its downstream function.</p><p id="p0020">This work is to investigate mechanisms of PRMT oligomerization using PRMT1 as a model enzyme, which is the predominant type-I PRMT member that is responsible for the majority of arginine methylation in proteins (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Compared with traditional structural biology methods such as X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM has the advantages of being suited for analyzing large protein complexes, having reduced radiation damage and maintaining native activity and functional state of samples and being capable of capturing multiple different structural states in one experiment (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Herein we for the first time resolved different forms of higher-ordered oligomer structural forms of PRMT1 with cryo-EM. We performed various orthogonal biophysical and biochemical experiments to illuminate the downstream effects of oligomerization on the enzymatic activity of PRMT. Our study reveals the structural basis of PRMT oligomerization and proves that oligomerization plays an effective role in regulating the enzymatic activity of PRMTs.</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Structural elucidation of PRMT1 higher-ordered oligomers using cryo-EM</title><p id="p0025">Several lines of evidence suggest that PRMT1 can form larger molecular weight assemblies beyond the dimer form (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, the structural organization of PRMT1 oligomers and the functional consequences of the oligomerization are unknown. In this study, we solved the cryo-EM structure of the oligomeric states of PRMT1. Human PRMT1 protein was expressed in fusion with a His-MBP tag in its N-terminal. After initial purification on the Ni-NTA affinity column, the His-MBP tag was removed, followed by protein purification by SEC. The SEC profile of PRMT1 showed one broad elution peak between 0.4 to 0.5 column volume in the S200 column (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</xref><italic>A</italic>), suggesting that the majority of the PRMT1 protein is in a single oligomeric form (the elution time point is close to tetramer or hexamer) under the SEC condition. Interestingly, we did not observe the dimeric form of PRMT1 on the SEC chromatogram, as shown in the protein crystal form (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The purified PRMT1 protein was concentrated at 0.7&#x000a0;mg/ml for cryo-EM structure study. The raw micrographs and 2D classification results displayed various oligomeric states of PRMT1, ranging from dimer, tetramer (dimer of dimers), hexamer (trimer of dimers), octamer (tetramer of dimers), decamer (pentamer of dimers), and even a helical filament form (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#x000a0;1</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>). The 3D reconstruction revealed the cryo-EM structures of these PRMT1 forms at (near-) atomic resolution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#x000a0;1</xref>, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">S1&#x02013;S3</xref>). Impressively, some filamentous PRMT1 forms were observed at high frequency in most cryo-EM images (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</xref>), which suggests a tendency of oligomer formation in a side-to-side manner. PRMT1 filaments has a right-handed helical symmetry with a rise of 23.34&#x000a0;&#x000c5; and a 103.59&#x000b0; twist, and each helical turn consisted of &#x0223c;7 monomers with a length of &#x0223c;160&#x000a0;&#x000c5; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>B</italic>). In contrast, the hexamer previously found in the crystal structure of yeast PRMT1 (Hmt1) protein forms an enclosed hexamer (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), completely different from the side-to-side packing manner in our human PRMT1 cryo-EM structure. The previous X-ray crystal structure revealed that PRMT8 dimers assemble into helical filaments and form a stable pentamer of dimers (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The PRMT1 filament discovered herein shows some similarity to that of PRMT8. PRMT1 filament also possesses three interfaces, referred as interfaces 1, 2, and 3 in PRMT8, for the helical filament formation. Interface 1 is involved in homodimer formation, as explained previously (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Interface 2 is formed between each dimer-dimer and is stabilized by a set of interactions. These interactions include His296 of dimer A with a backbone of Val325 and Asp279 of dimer B. The hydrogen bond between Lys297 (dimer A) and Asp279 (dimer B) was also observed. Lastly, Tys280 (dimer A) forms a hydrogen bond with His82 (Dimer B) backbone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>C</italic>). Interface 2 also comprises of Tyr81, His82, Asn83, Arg84, His85, His296, and Lys297 from one dimer and Arg206, Asn278, Asp279, Tyr280, Tyr323, Thr324, Val325, Lys326, and Leu359 from the other dimer. PRMT1 interface 2 is almost identical to PRMT8 interface 2, except for two residue changes: Lys107 (PRMT8) corresponding residue to PRMT1-Arg84 and Arg349 to the PRMT1-Lys326 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>D</italic>). Dimer 1 and 4 formed interface three. Several interface residues were observed in interface 3, including Cys250, Phe332, Cys272, Glu330, Glu254, Phe332, Ala270, Tyr335, Ala293, Lys326, and Thr293; most of them are identical to PRMT8 interface three. However, unlike PRMT8 interface 3, the distances between residues in the PRMT1 interface 3 are generally not close enough to form any strong interaction.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p><bold>Structural characterization of PRMT1.</bold><italic>A</italic>, surface view of 3D structures of various oligomerization states of PRMT1. <italic>B</italic>, surface view of the PRMT1 reconstruction superimposed with the subunit models; the subunits are represented in different colors.

The DLS can give information regarding the heterogeneity of protein in a sample (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In the past, DLS was used to study microbial and viral structure (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Nowadays, DLS is a popular method for studying nanoparticles, liposomes, and exosomes (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Researchers have also used DLS to study the protein folding of bovine serum albumin (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Therefore, we envisage that the DLS can be utilized to analyze the size changes of PRMT1 oligomeric compositions in an aqueous solution. We expect to see an increase in size with increasing protein concentrations. The prepared PRMT1 protein at varied concentrations was allowed to incubate in the aqueous buffer for equilibrium on ice for 10&#x000a0;min. The protein solution was filtered with 0.2-micron filter to remove any big interfering particles. The protein size was analyzed using a Malvern Zetasizer instrument. We took an average of three runs with about 25 scans each time to evaluate the data. When graphing the Zeta-average (Z-average) with the PRMT1 concentration, the Z-average of the protein size increased gradually with the increase in PRMT1 concentration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). Guanidine hydrochloride is a popular protein denaturant (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Hence, we used it to disrupt PRMT1 oligomers. As a negative control, we incubated PRMT1 in the presence of 6&#x000a0;M guanidine hydrochloride to disrupt oligomer formation. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>, the Z-average values of PRMT1 increased as a function of PRMT1 concentration, indicating growing oligomerization sizes. The Z-average values in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride were substantially smaller than those values without guanidine hydrochloride, attributed to the denaturing effect of the chaotropic agent. A literature reported that guanidine thiocyanate is a stronger denaturant than guanidine hydrochloride (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Hence, we performed an additional experiment to disrupt the PRMT1 oligomers with 5&#x000a0;M guanidine thiocyanate. Indeed, the data showed that guanidine thiocyanate was better at denaturing PRMT1 oligomers than guanine hydrochloride. The highest Z-average obtained when disrupted with 6&#x000a0;M guanidine hydrochloride was 8.43&#x000a0;nm, but it dramatically decreased to 1.27&#x000a0;nm in the presence of 5&#x000a0;M guanidine thiocyanate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). The comparative data demonstrated that PRMT1 formed oligomers in the aqueous buffer, the degree of oligomerization went higher as protein concentrations increased, and the chaotropic agents guanidine hydrochloride and guanidine thiocyanate denatured PRMT1 structure and disrupted its oligomeric states.<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p><bold>Oligomerization of PRMT1 detection by dynamic light scattering.</bold> Various concentrations of PRMT1 were incubated on ice for 10&#x000a0;min, then filtered by 0.2-micron syringe filter and collected data from the DLS.

We attempted to examine whether oligomerization promotes PRMT1 ability to generate multiple methylation states in substrates. We used a synthetic peptide with four possible arginine methylation sites for PRMT1: the R4 peptide (Ac-GG<bold>R</bold>GGFGG<bold>R</bold>GGKGG<bold>R</bold>GGFGG<bold>R</bold>GGFG). R4 peptide, SAM, and different concentrations of PRMT1 were mixed in an aqueous buffer to allow methylation to occur, and then the mixture was subjected to MALDI-MS analysis. The MALDI-MS spectra clearly demonstrated that the R4 peptide was multimethylated by PRMT1, from monomethylation to penta-methylation and hexa-methylation, even though the substrate peak was still the dominant species (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). Comparing the activities of 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M and 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M PRMT1, the latter generated more numbers of multiple methylation peaks, and the hexa-methylation peak was only observed at 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M. These data are suggestive that oligomerization promotes the processivity of PRMT1 catalysis. In the next experiment, we examined how the addition of PRMT1-E153Q, a catalytically inactive mutant, to the PRMT1-WT solution affects the progression of the R4 peptide methylation. Our rationale is that, even though PRMT1-E153Q is catalytically dead, it can still interact with PRMT1-WT, resulting in hybrid higher oligomers. Therefore, presenting varying amounts of PRMT1-E153Q to a fixed concentration of PRMT1-WT would be another ideal way to test how oligomerization impacts on PRMT1 activity. Firstly, PRMT1-E153Q was examined for enzymatic activity and indeed, there was no methylated product detected on the MALDI-MS spectra in a PRMT1-E153Q-SAM-R4 mixture (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S5</xref><italic>A</italic>). In contrast, PRMT1-WT exhibited up to six methylation states in the R4 substrate (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S5</xref><italic>B</italic>). Next, the concentration of PRMT1-WT was kept constant at 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, but the concentration of PRMT1-E153Q was changed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). Surprisingly, the amounts of all of the different methylation states increased as more and more PRMT1-E153Q protein was added. For example, comparing the reaction mixture containing 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M PRMT1-E153Q and the control reaction containing only PRMT1-WT, monomethylated product R4me1 increased from 13.16% to 20.22% and dimethylated R4me2 increased from 3.47% to 5.85%.

We used the phosphocellulose P81 filter paper&#x02013;binding assay to measure the catalytic activity of PRMT1 at different concentrations on individual peptides. Each reaction mixture was composed of PRMT1-WT at varied concentrations, at fixed concentrations of SAM and peptide. The reaction mixture was quenched with isopropanol, transferred to the P81 filter paper, and washed with sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9). The filter paper was placed in a scintillation vial, and after air drying, an Ultima Gold scintillation cocktail was added for scintillation counting. The measured count-per-minute (CPM) values correlated directly with the amounts of methylated peptide products. In a typical enzymatic catalysis, the product should be formed linearly as a function of enzyme concentration. However, the methylated product formation in PRMT1 catalysis did not follow a linear trend as a function of PRMT1 concentration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>, <italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>C</italic>). Instead, the activity-concentration plotting displayed an exponential-like curve for all the three tested peptides. The catalytic turnover rate (<italic>i.e.</italic>, <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) of PRMT1 catalysis was calculated as the slope of data curves of <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>, <italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>C</italic> (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the CPM values of the methylated peptides divided by PRMT1 concentrations) and displayed in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>, <italic>D</italic>&#x02013;<italic>F</italic>. For all of the three peptides, the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values were not constant; they all went up as the enzyme concentrations increased. The data further substantiated that oligomerization, as a result of increased enzyme concentrations, upregulates PRMT1 activity. These results coincide well with a preliminary study we reported before (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). It was notable that the catalytic turnover rate started to level off or even slightly decrease when PRMT1 concentrations were greater than &#x0223c;1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>, <italic>D</italic>&#x02013;<italic>F</italic>).

Constant PRMT1-WT concentration and various PRMT1-E153Q concentrations were maintained in the aqueous buffer prior to adding peptide and SAM to initiate the reaction. The reaction was quenched with isopropanol. The reaction mixture was loaded on the P81 filter paper that was air dried, washed, and immersed in scintillation cocktail for scintillation counting. Since the catalytically inactive PRMT1-E153Q mutant had only very weak activity, slightly above the background level (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S6</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>), any observed methylation activity would be attributed to PRMT1-WT, and any of PRMT1-E153Q induced effects would be due to its oligomerization with PRMT1-WT to form higher-order oligomers. Consistent with the MALDI-MS characterization, the methylation levels of all the tested peptides increased as more PRMT1-E153Q proteins were added to PRMT1-WT solution (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>, <italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>C</italic>).

To eliminate this possibility, we created a double mutant (PRMT1-H293G/E153Q) to further abolish PRMT1 activity. The data showed that the activity of PRMT1-H293G/E153Q was even weaker than PRMT1-E153Q, greatly diminished to near background level (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S6</xref>, <italic>C</italic>&#x02013;<italic>E</italic>). We then tested PRMT1-WT activity in the presence of various concentrations of PRMT1-H293G/E153Q (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>, <italic>G</italic>&#x02013;<italic>L</italic>).

The sequence length of Ac-H4(1&#x02013;16) is shorter than the Ac-H4(1&#x02013;22), so likely the former peptide binds to PRMT1 weaker and gets more easily released into the bulk solution than the latter. A constant concentration of PRMT1-WT was mixed with various concentrations of peptide and a constant concentration of radioactive SAM. After quenching the reaction, the reaction mixture was loaded onto the P81 filter paper that was washed, air-dried, and soaked in scintillation cocktail for scintillation counting.

The changes in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>0.5</sub> values suggest that the greater activity in the longer Ac-H4(1&#x02013;22) peptide was mechanistically contributed by both substrate binding and catalytic turnover enhancement.<fig id="fig8"><label>Figure&#x000a0;8</label><caption><p><bold>Steady state kinetic characterization of PRMT1 catalysis in oligomeric states.</bold> Radioactive kinetic parameters were measured using filter-binding assay.

Distance constraints were applied to ensure the PRMT1 active site residues E162 and E171 remained bound to R3 of the H4-peptide. Thus, all generated conformers were stably bound to one enzymatic active site. The decoys were subsequently filtered based on their Rosetta scores and clustered by RMSD to the initial model, which was based on the X-ray structure of PRMT1 monomer (PDB ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/1OR8" id="intref0010">1OR8</ext-link>) (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).

The H4 extended tail region wraps around the dimerization domain. Two aromatic residues from the dimerization arm, Y208 and Y211, bind the L10 residue from H4 and are key for the observed binding mode. Additional interactions contributing to the stable H4-peptide binding include salt bridges (<italic>e.g.</italic>, K12-D210, R17-D321), polar residue hydrogen bonding (K16-N218, A15-D210), and hydrophobic contacts (V21-C226) along the entire back surface of the dimerization domain (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;10</xref><italic>A</italic>). These findings underscore the essential role of the dimerization domain, not only for PRMT oligomerization but also for accommodating the extended tail region of the H4 substrate. Predictably, the catalytic activity of the PRMT1 monomer decreases when the dimerization domain is absent. By contrast, in the PTMT1 dimer, the H4-peptide cannot access the back surface of the dimerization arm. Instead, the tail region of the H4 substrate is redirected along the interface of the two monomers. The resulting conformation is stabilized by residue contacts with the front of the dimerization arm, the &#x003b1;X/&#x003b1;Y, and cofactor binding domains of the opposing PRMT1 monomer (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;10</xref><italic>B</italic>). In this orientation, L10 makes hydrophobic contacts with P308. Yet, the Y208 and Y211 residues still play a critical role in anchoring H4 to the dimerization arm.</p><p id="p0075">The H4 binding mode with the PRMT tetramer is distinct from both the monomer and the dimer complexes. Upon exiting the active site, the H4 peptide chain extends across the gap between the two dimers, reaching toward the &#x003b2;-barrel domain of one of the opposing monomers and completely bypassing the dimerization arm. Bridging residues (13&#x02013;15) are glycine and alanine, while the four tail H4 residues (16 through 20) play a pivotal role for anchoring the substrate to the opposing dimer primarily through salt bridge interactions (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;10</xref><italic>C</italic>). Thus, the tetramer binding mode rationalizes the weaker PRMT1 binding observed in the radiometric assays for Ac-H4(1&#x02013;16) relative to Ac-H4(1&#x02013;21). Moreover, stabilization of the H4 tail region in higher-order oligomers stems from PRMT1 structural elements that are distal from R3 and the active site E162 and E171. Consequently, a mutant PRMT1 monomer lacking the direct R3 binding to the active site could still engage in cooperative binding through the H4 tail region. This could explain the increased binding affinity of the H4 peptide to PRMT1-WT in the presence of the PRMT1-E153Q variant (E162Q in the human sequence).</p><p id="p0080">Another key observation from our computational models is that H4&#x02013;PRMT1 association is driven primarily by favorable electrostatic interactions. Besides glycine residues imparting flexibility to the H4 chain, there are positively charged residues forming favorable salt-bridge interactions with numerous negative residues on the PRMT surface. To address the electrostatic contribution to substrate binding, we used the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) and computed electrostatic potentials for the PRMT1 monomer, dimer, tetramer, and hexamer, respectively. The electrostatic potentials were mapped onto the molecular surface of each PRMT1 oligomer (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S7</xref>). We show that the H4 peptide is splayed on the oligomer surfaces, exclusively following patches of negative electrostatics. Moreover, the size of the negative electrostatics cavity increases from monomer to dimer, tetramer, and hexamer. Our docking results (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;10</xref>, <italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>C</italic>) show that across all PRMT1 oligomers, the H4 peptide consistently aligns with the regions of negative electrostatics. Thus, electrostatic forces play a pivotal role in determining the most favorable binding orientations. In addition to favorable binding, increases in the overall negative electrostatic potential in the higher order PRMT oligomers significantly contribute to electrostatic substrate steering into the enzymatic active sites, directly impacting the catalytic rates.</p><p id="p0085">To quantify the effect of electrostatic steering on the H4-peptide binding kinetics, we computed <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> rates for the formation of the monomer, dimer, tetramer, and hexamer complexes using Brownian dynamics simulations. The simulations were conducted with the Browndye code and modeled the diffusive encounters between the H4 and the PRMT1 oligomers and estimated the binding rates based on defined distance criteria for binding (&#x0003c;b_radius) and escape (&#x0003e;q_radius) as shown schematically in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;10</xref><italic>G</italic>. To achieve sufficient statistical sampling, 250,000 Brownian dynamics trajectories were computed per simulation system. The calculated <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> values for PRMT1 monomers, dimers, tetramers, and hexamers are 5.65&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>&#x000a0;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 1.33&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup>&#x000a0;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 2.14&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup>&#x000a0;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and 3.12&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup>&#x000a0;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;10</xref><italic>H</italic>). The most significant increase in <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> is observed from PRMT1 monomer to dimer, as the additional PRMT1 monomer unit provided regions of negative electrostatics accessible to the H4 peptide tail. Thus, electrostatic steering is key for the observed rate enhancement upon PRMT multimerization. However, this cooperative effect becomes less pronounced as we go to the tetramer and hexamer due to the limited length of the H4 peptide. Nevertheless, in line with radiometric assay measurements, these calculations demonstrated a consistent increase in <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> rates with higher degrees of oligomerization. Thus, we infer that the observed rate enhancement stems from the enhanced electrostatic interactions in the dimer, tetramer, and hexamer species.</p><p id="p0090">We examined the impact of mutations on the H4(1&#x02013;21) peptide binding to different PRMT1 oligomers. The derived Rosetta ddG scores serve as an indicator of the mutation's impact on the peptide binding free energy. Increased positive values indicate a significant loss of peptide binding after mutation, whereas minimal values exert a reduced influence. The mutations in the active site and dimerization arms of PRMT1 structures exhibited larger ddG scores (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S8</xref> and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table&#x000a0;S2</xref>). The mutation with large positive value can disrupt the peptide binding with PRMT1 oligomers. Further, experimental analysis of these mutational studies may be substantial to identify the loss of peptide binding to PRMT1 oligomers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0095">PRMT1 is the predominant member of the human PRMT family. Crystallographic studies reveal PRMT1 forms a stable homodimer, which is the basic unit of the active enzyme, and the disruption of homodimer formation results in the inactive enzyme (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Beyond dimerization, several previous studies support the idea that PRMTs, including PRMT1, are capable of forming higher-order oligomeric forms (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The structural mechanism and functional consequences of PRMT higher-ordered oligomerization are poorly defined. Our current cryo-EM imaging for the first time comprehensively captured the various structural forms of the higher-order oligomers of PRMT1, which includes tetramer (dimer of dimers), hexamer (trimer of dimers), octamer (tetramer of dimers), decamer (pentamer of dimers); and impressively, the oligomerization can extend PRMT1 into a helical filament. Observation of multiple oligomeric states of PRMT1 suggests that the higher-order oligomerization is highly dynamic. Of comparison, on the elution profile of SEC analysis of PRMT1, only a single major peak was observed at an elution time point approximately matching either the tetrameric or hexameric form (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</xref><italic>A</italic>). One explanation for the difference in oligomeric observations between cryo-EM and SEC experiments is that the various oligomeric forms of PRMT1 in the aqueous solution are faithfully preserved during the vitrification process and captured later in the EM imaging stage, while the SEC experiment involves a harsher condition (<italic>e.g.</italic>, potential interference by high column pressure, mobile phase turbulence, interaction with stationary phase matrix) and thus many meta-stable oligomeric forms of PRMT1 may have been disrupted during the elution. Indeed, our other unpublished SEC data also suggest that higher orders of oligomerization can occur at high PRMT1 concentrations (data not shown). The oligomeric states of PRMT1 likely are influenced by its residing contexts and experimental conditions, such as temperature, protein concentration, pH, and ionic strength, <italic>etc.</italic> (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The ability to dynamically change the oligomerization state may provide a functional regulation of PRMT activity in the cell. The spatial arrangement of the higher-ordered human PRMT1 is different from the previously reported yeast PRMT1 structure (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Interestingly, the filamentous structure of human PRMT1 is similar to that of PRMT8 observed using X-ray crystallography (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Comparing PRMT1 and PRMT8 filaments, interface 2 proposed by the PRMT8 filament structure is critical and conserved. Asp276, His296, and Lys297 in interface 2 were not reported previously but played important roles in interface two. Asp279, His296, and Lys297 are evolutionarily highly conserved across the species, suggesting the importance of these residues in the formation of PRMT1 oligomers (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S4</xref>).</p><p id="p0100">Our previous study using chemical crosslinking demonstrates that an increase in the concentration of PRMT1 enzymes leads to the formation of more oligomeric forms (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In this study, we utilized DLS as a physically mild method to examine the oligomer changes, and it was clearly proved that PRMT1 forms higher-order oligomers in a concentration-dependent manner. We further showed that the oligomer formation can be disrupted by guanidine denaturing agent. The enzymatic activity of PRMT1 was seen to increase as higher-order oligomeric structures were formed. This behavior holds true in all tested peptides, including BTN-H4(1&#x02013;22), R4, and Ac-H4(1&#x02013;20)R3me. The conclusion that the increase in the oligomer formation of PRMT1 increases its catalytic activity is solidly supported by the experimental data of increased <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> at higher PRMT1 concentrations and also by the fact that even the addition of the inactive PRMT1-E153Q mutant was able to enhance the methyltransferase activity of PRMT1-WT through oligomerization. As regards the oligomer effect of PRMT1 by adding PRMT1-E153Q to the reaction, the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of PRMT1-WT/PRMT1-E153Q mixtures was 2.6-fold higher than the PRMT1 alone. This data was consistent with a previous literature report (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Comparing the steady-state kinetic parameters of both Ac-H4(1&#x02013;16) and Ac-H4(1&#x02013;22) in PRMT1 catalysis, Ac-H4(1&#x02013;22) showed a greater <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and lower <italic>K</italic><sub>0.5</sub> (equivalent to <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> in Michaelis-Menten kinetics). This data supports that the C-terminal residues of the H4 peptide contribute to the PRMT1 substrate binding and catalysis, which corroborates the previous study by Osborne <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The key binding role of the C-terminal residues of the H4 peptide in PRMT1 interaction was also clearly seen in our modeling (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;10</xref><italic>C</italic>). The greater <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> Ac-H4(1&#x02013;22) than Ac-H4(1&#x02013;16) also suggests that the C-terminal residues of the substrate may allosterically regulate the transition state of the active site of PRMT1, in addition to enhancing the binding interaction.</p><p id="p0105">Analysis of the products of peptide substrate methylation with MALDI-MS at different concentrations of PRMT1 demonstrated that the methylation states of the substrates were greatly affected by PRMT1 oligomerization. The higher order of oligomerization of PRMT1 (promoted by increasing PRMT1-WT enzyme concentrations or by the addition of PRMT1-E153Q mutant to the WT enzyme), the higher the methylation states were seen on the substrate peptides. In our experimental condition, the majority of the R4 peptides were in the unmethylated form, and only about 10% of the peptides are mono- and multi-methylated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#x000a0;3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Importantly, di- and multi-methylated products were clearly seen, which hints the monomethylated intermediate is preferably further methylated than the unmethylated substrate. This trend is also observed with the H4 peptide, where monomethylating event occurred at least 4-fold higher than dimethylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). These data suggest that oligomerization enhances the processivity of PRMT1 in substrate methylation. Our previous transient kinetics studies show that the active site of PRMT1 follows a distributive model of catalysis for mono- and di-methylation, which is dictated by the ordered cofactor and substrate binding and release kinetics in the catalysis (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Putting the two factors together, we propose a catalytic scheme that the substrate arginine has to be evacuated from the active site of PRMT1 for SAH-SAM exchange before next round of methylation reaction, that is, a distributive active-site catalysis. Meanwhile, the oligomerization renders PRMT1 with the ability to perform certain degrees of processive methylation: some of the monomethylated intermediate substrate, after leaving the active site of one protomer, are bound to proximal active sites within the PRMT1 oligomer complex, without being fully dispersed into the bulk solution. Such a proposal would match well with the partially processive methylation behavior observed previously by Thomson et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p id="p0110">The increased <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of PRMT1 at higher oligomeric states implies that oligomerization may allosterically facilitate the transition-state formation in the active site. As mentioned above, the C-terminal residues of the substrate may also allosterically regulate the transition state of the active site of PRMT1. These allosteric factors may explain why the steady-state kinetics data of PRMT1 catalysis fit well only to the Hill equation, but not the classical Michaelis&#x02013;Menten model (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The dissociation rates of H4FL peptide from PRMT1 in the stopped-flow fluorescence measurement were smaller at higher oligomeric states (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;9</xref>), demonstrating that the H4 substrate is retained longer in the high-order oligomeric states of PRMT1. It is foreseeable that oligomerization enables PRMT1 to better retain its substrate on the enzyme&#x02019;s surface for the subsequent methylation event following the initial mono-methylation event. Furthermore, our molecular modeling shows that the association rate constants of H4(1&#x02013;21) peptide binding to PRMT1 increase at higher oligomeric states due to enhanced favorable electrostatics in the higher-order oligomers. (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;10</xref><italic>H</italic>). Thus, adjacent protomers in oligomeric PRMT1 help immobilize the substrate on the enzyme surface, which would increase local concentrations of a substrate on the enzyme surface, leading to enhanced enzymatic activity. Taken together, oligomerization enhances substrate binding and also allosterically improves the transition-state formation, which synergistically contributes to the enhancing effect of oligomerization on PRMT enzymatic activity.</p><p id="p0115">In conclusion, our structural study and combined biophysical and biochemical data demonstrated that PRMT1 exists in different oligomeric states in the aqueous solution, and PRMT1 becomes more active when it is at a high concentration due to higher-order oligomer formation. PRMT1 mutants, even those that lose activity, can form oligomers with WT PRMT1 and thereby enhances its activity. Our study establishes higher-ordered oligomerization as a molecular mechanism for PRMT activity regulation. PRMT oligomerization and the functional consequence we herein found pose a confounding implication for PRMT activity regulation in physiology and pathology. PRMT mutation has been found in a number of tumors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/" id="intref0015">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/</ext-link>). Especially, some studies have shown that cellular PRMT1 level can be present at submicromolar concentrations (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In the scenario of heterologous mutations, some PRMT mutants may lose both catalytic activity and oligomerization ability, while some other inactive PRMT mutants may still be able to contribute to cellular arginine methylation through their oligomerization interaction with and activity-enhancing effect on WT PRMTs. Furthermore, PRMT hetero-oligomerization has been increasingly recognized in recent years (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). It is possible that inactive PRMT mutants may affect methyltransferase activities of other PRMT members through hetero-oligomeric interactions. Future studies are warranted to address these important questions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Experimental procedures</title><p id="p0120">The general chemicals and organic solvents were purchased from commercial sources at the highest purity available.

The FlexPepDock <italic>ab initio</italic> protocol employs a two-step approach: first, a coarse-grained representation of the protein and peptide structures is utilized to explore potential conformations of the peptide backbone across the PRMT1 oligomer surface. Subsequently, all-atom refinement, including the repacking of side chains, is performed to optimize the models. Building upon prior knowledge from the crystal structure of the PRMT1 monomer complexed with the substrate peptide (PDB ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/1OR8" id="intref0020">1OR8</ext-link>) (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), we enforced constraints on the interaction between the R3 residue of the H4 peptide and two conserved glutamic acid residues, E162 and E171, of the PRMT1 while allowing flexibility for the rest of the H4 peptide. For each PRMT1 oligomer (monomer, dimer, and tetramer), a total of 100,000 docked models (decoys) were generated, which were then filtered and clustered based on their Rosetta scores and RMSD from the initial model, respectively. The primary docking configurations for each PRMT1 oligomer were chosen based on the lowest Rosetta score of the most dominant cluster.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.8.2"><title>Brownian Dynamics simulations</title><p id="p0180">To assess how PRMT1 oligomerization impacts H4-peptide binding kinetics, we conducted Brownian Dynamics simulations using BrownDye software (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>).

The Brownian Dynamics simulations commenced by randomly dispersing the H4 peptide around the PRMT1 oligomer, after which the substrate began to move under the influence of hydrodynamic and electrostatic forces between the molecules. Simulation termination criteria included either binding occurrence or H4 peptide escape. Binding was considered to have occurred if the dummy atom of the H4 peptide reached a spherical region within 11.75&#x000a0;&#x000c5;&#x000a0;(b_radius) from the PRMT1 oligomer.
