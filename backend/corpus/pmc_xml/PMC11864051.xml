In the USA, the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) for the paediatric population were published in 2011 a revision of, including the tolerable upper intake level values [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], while in the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) actualized the values in 2017 [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Covering the DRI with oral feeding is paradoxically difficult in numerous children and adolescents compared to those depending on parenteral nutrition: indeed many of them do not consume &#x02018;adequate&#x02019;, balanced food, that is do not cover their DRI for multiple different reasons, including the high proportion of children with picky eating behaviour, largely a phenomenon of industrialized countries that stresses parents, but also poor diets in adolescents [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><fig position="float" id="FB1"><label>Box 1</label><caption><p>no caption available</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cocnm-27-266-g001" position="float"/></fig><p>Nevertheless, there are situations in which complementation or supplementation might be considered, to either complete a micronutrients poor diet, or treat a deficiency. In his editorial, Conrad Cole noted that micronutrients malnutrition can be referred to as a &#x02018;hidden hunger&#x02019; [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], that may occur in the presence of an otherwise nutritionally or energy appropriate diet. It can be caused by eating food that is cheap and filling, but deficient in essential micronutrients, which is more likely in periods of economic depression [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A large German cohort study showed that most children were covering their needs, with iodine, iron and vitamin D being frequently at the lower limit [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Which children should benefit from a more advanced diagnosis of their micronutrient status, and eventually receive supplements?</p><p>For paediatric patients depending on parenteral nutrition, nutritional guidelines provide exact recommendations [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which have recently been re-updated [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As in adults on medical nutrition therapy, monitoring blood levels is recommended as underlying conditions may modify the needs [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], while the one-size-fits-all complement products may not cover specific needs [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Micronutrients deficiency generally is associated with global insufficient feeding, i.e. malnutrition, but with regional specificities [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Studies conducted under the authority of World Health Organization [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and UNICEF [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have shown the efficacy of food fortification programs. UNICEF has listed the critical micronutrients associated with public health problems, that is, those for which deficiency hinders development and function, including vitamin A (blindness), iron (anaemia), iodine (goitre and brain development) and folic acid (in adolescent girls) [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. But other micronutrients are highly susceptible to deficiency with deleterious health consequences, such as zinc (immunity), vitamin D (bone health, rickets) and vitamin C (scurvy). Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref> provides a summary of functions and clinical symptoms with their DRI by age category of the above MNs. In any country characterized by endemic micronutrient deficiencies, this should be specifically addressed with dedicated food fortification policies, as no individual micronutrient administration would be able to achieve equivalent results.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Functions, clinical symptoms in children and DRI for the most frequently deficient micronutrients [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="0"><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Micronutrient</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Principal functions</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clinical symptoms of deficiency</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DRI</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Iodine (&#x003bc;g/day)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Constituent of thyroid hormones and a regulator of thyroid gland function</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Goitre, hypothyroidism, cretinism</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4&#x02013;8<break/>9&#x02013;13 M+F<break/>14&#x02013;18 M+F</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65<break/>73<break/>95</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Iron (mg/day)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">functional component of heme, oxygen binding and transport (haemoglobin, myoglobin), oxygen metabolism (catalases, peroxidases), cellular respiration and electron transport (cytochromes).

Search words were &#x02018;micronutrient supplement&#x02019; (vitamin or trace element), &#x02018;Micronutrient deficiency&#x02019;, &#x02018;Malnutrition&#x02019;, &#x02018;Clinical trials&#x02019; AND &#x02018;Schoolchild or adolescent&#x02019; published during the last 4&#x0200a;years with special attention to the last two years.</p></sec><sec><title>MICRONUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES</title><p>Deficiency is defined as an intake below the standard recommendation and either the presence of clinical signs or symptoms or blood/plasma concentrations below reference range together with metabolic effects of inadequacy [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Due to growth, children have a higher nutrient requirement per kilogram of body weight than adults, and insufficient intakes may lead to disorders. The proportion of children and adolescents with poor diets is high worldwide, and many young children are not meeting RDI for several micronutrients [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Deficiencies, whether diseases specific or due to global malnutrition, will have negative short-term and long-term effects, including physical, developmental and cognitive impairment, increased susceptibility to infections, higher morbidity and mortality, and decreased productivity later in life [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Typically, zinc deficiency during childhood was shown by Prasad in the 60&#x0200a;s to cause growth retardation [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the 90&#x0200a;s, zinc supplements combined with/without other MNs (mainly iron) were recognized to be beneficial in the presence of a diet low in animal products and based on high-phytate cereals and legumes (especially during the period of complementary feeding), together with severe growth stunting, low plasma zinc concentrations and episodes of persistent diarrhoea [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The early correction of deficiency may be of major significance, as deficiency can impact cognitive function in later life, as shown by a follow-up study from the Santiago area (Chile): 1018 adolescents underwent psychological evaluation, and individuals who were enrolled were &#x02018;normal&#x02019; at birth but had iron deficiency diagnosed between 12 and 18&#x0200a;months of age [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]: participants who had received iron supplementation in infancy had lower parent-reported conduct disorder symptoms than those who did not. The threshold was &#x02018;deficiency&#x02019; with or without anaemia [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Infancy iron deficiency seems associated with social problems in adolescence: the prevention opportunity looks of utmost human and social importance.</p><p>Vitamin C deficiency can result in scurvy, which is generally considered rare in high-income countries, but it has increasingly been reported [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17<sup>&#x025aa;</sup></xref>]: a high level of suspicion should probably be maintained in children with musculoskeletal complaints.</p><p>The risk of focusing on single micronutrients rather than on the bundle of essential micronutrients incurs the risk of overlooking other micronutrient inadequacies. Nutrition-focused strategies should therefore have a major place in handling these widespread problems [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18<sup>&#x025aa;</sup></xref>].</p><p>The above mentioned picky-eating behaviour is present in countries with or without food-insecurity. This usually resolves without affecting the child's development, but there is a subgroup of children for whom this is not the case [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There is a consensus for a risk of insufficient iron and zinc intake [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>&#x025aa;&#x025aa;</sup>]. A Taiwanese study including 203 children detected picky eating in 67.5% of children in whom a high prevalence of low zinc levels was associated with low development and poor physical activity [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>&#x025aa;&#x025aa;</sup>]: while not adjusted for confounders, this study should be considered a warning sign. This category of children merits close monitoring, and eventually more advanced diagnosis of status if deviations from the standard percentiles is detected.</p></sec><sec><title>RECENT INTERVENTION STUDIES</title><p>Several studies have tested micronutrient complements and supplements in conditions associated with micronutrient deficiency such as malnutrition, anaemia, psychological disorders and other diseases.</p><sec><title>Malnutrition</title><p>Malnutrition remains widespread and includes micronutrient deficiencies. Poor diets are commonly present in adolescents. This pivotal period of life, which is frequently associated with some major changes in eating habits, makes adolescents a vulnerable group to commercial exploitation and other unhealthy influences, with lifelong and intergenerational consequences [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18<sup>&#x025aa;</sup></xref>]: it may result in both underweight and overweight development [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Multiple micronutrient deficiencies exist in schoolchildren in countries like India. The gap between nutrient intake and requirements may be bridged by fortification, enabling fighting deficiencies as shown by Kuriyan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] who used a multi-micronutrient fortified milk beverage 6&#x0200a;days/week for 5&#x0200a;months. The prevalence of iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency decreased significantly with no major effect on cognitive or physical performance [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The global malnutrition issue should ideally be corrected first.</p><p>A high energy intake RCT tested a daily lipid-based 500&#x0200a;kcal supplement in 34 malnourished children aged 7.1&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1.5&#x0200a;years and conducted over 4&#x0200a;weeks [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]: anthropometric variables, haemoglobin (Hb) and iron levels (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.001) improved.</p><p>Endemic selenium deficiency affects some specific geographic areas distributed in different countries over the globe. In an area with a high prevalence of Kashin-Beck disease, a degenerative cartilage disorder [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22<sup>&#x025aa;</sup></xref>], a Chinese study including 240 children showed that the dietary Se intake was 40.0% in the endemic area. The study also showed that low diversity of food was contributive, opening the type of intervention to more than only selenium fortification.</p><p>Several case reports (not referenced herein) show that imbalanced diet resulting from exclusive consumption by children and adolescents of junk food and snacks can result in severe selenium, vitamin C and vitamin A deficiencies, and may even result in dramatic clinical pictures, such as acute blindness.</p><p>Lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets are generally well balanced if they include sufficient amounts of dairy products [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23<sup>&#x025aa;</sup></xref>]. But this is not the case with vegetarian, and especially strict vegan diets: iron, zinc, iodine, and vitamins B12 and D intakes are usually below DRI, as are the intakes of omega-3 PUFA. The risk of iodine deficiency is particularly high in vegetarian/strict vegan children as shown by a recent Czech study that included an investigation of thyroid function [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24<sup>&#x025aa;</sup></xref>]. The same group studied vitamin B12 status; vegetarian/strict vegan children and observed a high prevalence of over-supplementation with high blood levels [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]: the impact of persistent B12 hypervitaminosis deserves future studies. Some national guidelines already exist for this category of children [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and will certainly be completed in the future. Performing appropriate blood tests enables diagnosis of deficiency (or excess) [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and prescription of adapted food complements during rapid growth periods limits the risk of deficiency [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23<sup>&#x025aa;</sup></xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Anaemia &#x02013; iron, B9, B12 deficiency</title><p>Anaemia adversely affects cognitive and motor development and causes fatigue and low productivity: it remains disproportionally prevalent in low and middle-income countries, mostly affecting women and children [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Iron deficiency and anaemia undermine childhood development, leading to poor cognitive and physical performance and increased susceptibility to disease. A study including data from 107 countries from 1995 to 2011, showed a modest improvement of Hb over time, reflecting intervention policies, with a prevalence of anaemia in children decreasing from 48 to 43%, still translating into 273 million anaemic children [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similarly, among adolescents, anaemia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality with long-term health and economic consequences [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28<sup>&#x025aa;</sup></xref>]. A cross-sectional survey conducted among 2479 secondary school students in Zanzibar to determine the prevalence and factors associated with anaemia showed that 53.3% were anaemic according to WHO criteria: women had higher odds ratio (OR) of anaemia than men (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.47), as had stunted adolescents (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.38), and those without access to private toilets (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.68): these results confirm the importance of sanitation, hygiene and nutritional measures (iron-rich foods), that is a multifaceted intervention.</p><p>Hereafter, some recent RCTs have shown that the impact of iron deficiency can be reduced by different strategies. A community based RCT conducted in 226 Ethiopian girls tested a 3-month trial of weekly iron+folic acid supplements [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Initially, about 49% of adolescents had marginal iron stores, and significant improvement of serum folate, serum ferritin and Hb concentrations was observed compared to control. A RCT testing daily supplements of iron+folic acid with/without vitamin B<sub>12</sub> for 90&#x0200a;days in 760 adolescent anaemic Indian girls showed correction of iron status and of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, the addition of B<sub>12</sub> having no significant effect [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30<sup>&#x025aa;</sup></xref>].

Nevertheless, a retrospective survey of consumers who purchased Autism Nutrition Research Center products (ANRC-EP), a multi-micronutrient product for children or adults with ASD, enrolled 211 people including 85 children aged 5--15&#x0200a;years. The study showed significant benefits for a wide range of symptoms, and low adverse effects. Of note, no blood levels were available, and the supplements contained a combination of micronutrient delivering doses modestly above DRI [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>A study including 430 children aged 7--10&#x0200a;years free of neurological disorders showed that trace element levels were linked to intellectual development and selective eating disorders: low blood levels were present in 20.3% for iron, 42.5% for zinc and 14% for copper levels, majority of children presenting more than one low levels [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44<sup>&#x025aa;</sup></xref>].</p><p>A Thai RCT, including 52 participants with iron deficiency, tested ferrous iron supplements versus placebo for 12&#x0200a;weeks [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>&#x025aa;&#x025aa;</sup>]: a significant improvement of ADHD symptoms was reported by the parents.</p><p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is related to neurodevelopmental disorders potentially due to micronutrient deficits.

A RCT including 74 children with ADHD tested a double-blind vitamin D intervention delivering (50&#x0200a;000&#x0200a;IU/week) plus magnesium (6&#x0200a;mg/kg/day) and showed a significant improvement of behavioural function and mental health. Of note, the children with mean age 9.1&#x0200a;years started with very low vitamin D levels (17&#x0200a;ng/ml), with a correction towards normal levels in the intervention group: the intervention and improved function was therefore associated with the correction of a deficit [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>FOOD FORTIFICATION AND SUPPLEMENTS</title><p>There is no controversy regarding the utility and efficacy of the food fortification programs to fight endemic deficiencies in low to middle-income countries [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and milk fortification is a validated strategy in infants. But there is no consensus regarding the treatment of borderline status in high-income countries. Current data indicate that worldwide supplements are consumed by 24&#x02013;38% of school-age children [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], confirming an analysis of the US National Health data base 2003&#x02013;2006 [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], which showed that the prevalence of supplement use was 42% in 2&#x02013;8&#x0200a;years. In this age group, there seemed to be limited inadequacies for other micronutrient intakes, while a higher prevalence of inadequate intakes of vitamins A, C and E was observed among 9 to 18-year-olds. In all age groups, supplement use increased the likelihood of intakes above the upper tolerable intake level for some micronutrients.</p><p>The study also showed the inadequacy of some supplements available on the market in different age groups [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Indeed, &#x02018;more is not always better&#x02019;, as Upper Limit (UL) may be exceeded, as stressed by the WHO, and may occur when different preventions programs overlap [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Commercial supplements are confronted the difficulty of different DRI/RDA over age: the products available for kids cover the needs in a highly variable way (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The German consumer organization gathered a large sample of products available over the counter or web [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and analysed their content, which in some cases is problematic (too low or too high doses). Therefore, prescription of supplements should follow a careful dietary history, and address two very different situations: global malnutrition in which the intervention should be &#x02018;nutrition&#x02019; with specific supplements oriented towards the most frequent deficiencies while integrating socioeconomic possibilities, that is, anaemia and iron deficiency, and the situation of picky eating habits of incomplete foods, or disease related deficiencies, where micronutrient supplements alone may be the best option.
