Unlike Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL is characterized by the absence of Reed-Sternberg cells, a defining feature of Hodgkin lymphoma. However, immunohistochemistry (IHC) plays a crucial role in accurately differentiating between NHL and Hodgkin lymphoma by identifying specific cellular markers that provide definitive diagnostic clarity beyond the presence or absence of Reed-Sternberg cells [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. NHL can develop from various lymphocyte types, including B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells, giving rise to numerous subtypes with unique clinical features and treatment requirements [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Clinical manifestations of NHL depend on the specific subtype and the disease's location but commonly include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, fatigue, and unexplained weight loss. The diagnostic process typically incorporates imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans, alongside histopathological analysis of biopsy specimens [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Treatment strategies for NHL are individualized and may involve chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or stem cell transplantation, depending on the patient's disease subtype, stage, and overall health condition [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>NHL affecting the musculoskeletal system is relatively rare and poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The prognosis depends on factors such as the NHL subtype, the extent of disease involvement, and the patient's response to treatment.</p><p>In this report, we detail the treatment administered to a patient who presented to our clinic with ankle pain and was subsequently diagnosed with NHL following biopsy surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 49-year-old man presented with complaints of persistent pain in the left ankle lasting for three months. He reported no associated constitutional symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, or night sweats. Additionally, there was no history of fever, prior infection, or a local wound in the affected area. Upon his initial visit, a thorough clinical evaluation was conducted, and three-view ankle radiographs were requested to assess the underlying cause of the symptoms. Informed consent was obtained from the patient before any diagnostic or therapeutic procedures were performed. Irregularities observed in the talus on the radiographs raised suspicion of possible malignancy or osteomyelitis, prompting a request for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to aid in differentiation (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>X-ray images of the patient at the time of hospital admission: (A) AP view of the ankle, (B) mortise view of the ankle, and (C) lateral view of the ankle.</title><p>The white arrows indicate the area of the lesion.</p><p>AP: anterior-posterior</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000077987-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>Initially, a contrast-enhanced MRI of the ankle was ordered due to suspicion of osteomyelitis. Following the MRI scans, a heterogeneous contrast-enhancing lesion, measuring 5x5x6 cm, was observed, causing significant destruction in the talus, obliterating the subtalar joint spaces, and causing destruction in the medial malleolus, while also surrounding the tendons of the tibialis posterior and flexor muscles (Figures <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>-<xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Sagittal MRI of the left ankle, obtained with T2-weighted sequences following contrast administration, shows abnormal signal intensity and contrast enhancement in the distal tibia, talus, and surrounding soft tissues, initially suggestive of osteomyelitis.

PET imaging revealed a highly hypermetabolic mass lesion in the left ankle, causing extensive destruction of the talus, extending to the medial malleolus of the left tibia, with significant extensions into the soft tissues posteriorly and medially around the ankle, and extending proximally along the leg vessels.</p><p>The biopsy material was sent for pathological and microbiological analysis. The patient was discharged from the hospital the following day and scheduled for follow-up appointments in the outpatient clinic. Immunohistochemically, atypical cells were CD20 (+), BCL2 (+), MUM1 (+), CMYC positive in 5-30% of cells, cyclin D1 (-), and CD30 (-). Epstein-Barr virus early ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcript was not detected using the in situ hybridization method (Epstein-Barr encoding region (EBER)-negative). The background showed a small number of mature T lymphocytes staining with CD3. The Ki-67 proliferation index was high (80-90%). These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of high-grade B-cell NHL. Additionally, there was no evidence of bone marrow involvement.&#x000a0;</p><p>During the preoperative preparation, no abnormalities were detected in the evaluation of the patient's blood parameters.

Unlike Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL is distinguished by the absence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are characteristic of the former. NHL can originate from different types of lymphocytes, such as B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells, leading to various subtypes with unique clinical presentations and treatment pathways. The symptoms of NHL can vary significantly depending on the subtype and the location of the disease, with common signs including lymph node enlargement, fever, night sweats, fatigue, and unexplained weight loss. However, our patient did not exhibit any of these symptoms and presented solely with diffuse pain around the ankle [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The diagnostic process often involves a combination of imaging techniques, such as CT and PET scans, along with histopathological evaluation of biopsy samples. Treatment modalities for NHL are individualized and may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or stem cell transplantation, tailored to the specific subtype, disease stage, and the patient's overall health condition.</p><p>Following the diagnosis of NHL through a biopsy procedure in our patient, consultations were requested with the relevant departments to initiate chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Without undertaking any additional surgical interventions, we collaborated with the internal medicine department for the treatment of the primary disease.</p><p>Although NHL more commonly presents with the involvement of lymphatic system organs, it can also, albeit rarely, affect the musculoskeletal system. While musculoskeletal involvement more frequently occurs in the pelvic region, it can exceptionally manifest in the foot and ankle joints [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. What made our patient unique was the exceedingly rare localization of the disease in the ankle as its primary manifestation. Despite initially suspecting osteomyelitis or malignancy, the pathological diagnosis confirmed NHL. Although lymphoproliferative diseases like NHL are rarely encountered in the ankle, they should not be excluded from the differential diagnosis. A thorough examination, including the evaluation of blood parameters, is essential, and a multidisciplinary treatment approach should be considered. Furthermore, coordinated management with the internal medicine department is critical for treating patients with lymphoproliferative diseases.</p><p>In a study conducted by Binici and colleagues, it was shown that, albeit very rarely, NHL can originate from the skeletal muscle. However, this is even less common than cases originating from bone and joint and should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Studies have also identified the elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a prognostic indicator [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For our patient, no abnormalities were detected in blood parameters during the preoperative period. Additionally, no elevation in LDH levels was observed during the postoperative period when the patient was referred to the internal medicine department.</p><p>Primary bone lymphoma (PBL) generally has a favorable prognosis, with five-year survival rates of 80-95% in localized cases, especially with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Early-stage disease and normal LDH levels are associated with better outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>While lymphoproliferative diseases primarily involve the lymphatic system, they can, in rare cases, manifest clinically by affecting the joints of the musculoskeletal system. Such atypical presentations pose significant diagnostic challenges, as they can mimic more common conditions like tumors or osteomyelitis. This highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for lymphoproliferative diseases, such as NHL, in patients presenting with joint-related symptoms and atypical imaging findings.</p><p>A multidisciplinary approach, including thorough imaging studies, histopathological examination, and collaboration between orthopedic surgeons, oncologists, and pathologists, is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective management. Recognizing rare presentations of diseases like NHL in musculoskeletal sites can prevent misdiagnoses and ensure the timely initiation of appropriate treatment, improving patient outcomes. This case underscores the importance of considering lymphoproliferative diseases in the differential diagnosis of joint involvement and emphasizes the necessity of a holistic and coordinated approach in their management.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Ar&#x00131;n Celayir, Muhammed Yusuf Afacan, Baran Sevgil, Mahmut K.
