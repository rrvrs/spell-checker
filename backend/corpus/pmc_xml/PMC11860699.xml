This time she is exhausted and can no longer cope; she is visiting the cardiologist for palpitations, hypertension and a recent myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec id="sec9085"><title>Results</title><p>After a positive screening for ADHD, based on her lifetime symptoms of inattention, restlessness and impulsivity, as well as mood swings, she is referred to a psychiatrist for assessment of ADHD, mood and sleep problems. The pathophysiology behind this cluster of disorders during (peri)menopause, as well as the treatment options will be discussed based on Mary&#x02019;s case.</p></sec><sec id="sec9086"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both ADHD in women, (peri)menopausal mood disorders as well as the heart complaints in women during menopause are underrecognised and undertreated, leading to unneccesary suffering and cardiac death in women. It is time for psychiatry to join forces with cardiology and gynaecology for better recognition, sharing knowledge and multidisciplinary treatment of women with mental disorders such as ADHD during menopausal transition (see www.h3-netwerk.nl).</p></sec><sec id="sec9087"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
