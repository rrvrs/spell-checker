We have explored how different modules&#x02014;linkers and head groups&#x02014;affect the ability of these probes to integrate into lipid membranes and how they distribute intracellularly in mouse astrocytes and fibroblasts targeting lysosomes and lipid droplets. Each compound was assessed for its solvatochromic behavior in organic solvents and model membranes. Molecular dynamics simulations and lipid partitioning using giant unilamellar vesicles showed how these analogs behave in model membranes compared to cholesterol. Live-cell imaging demonstrated distinct staining patterns and cellular uptake behaviors, further validating the utility of these probes in biological systems. We compared the empirical results with those of BODIPY-cholesterol, a well-regarded fluorescent cholesterol analog. The internalization efficiency of fluorescent CND probes varies in different cell types and is affected mainly by the head groups. Our results demonstrate that the modular design significantly simplifies the creation of fluorescent cholesteryl probes bearing distinct spectral, biophysical, and cellular targeting features. It is a valuable toolkit for imaging in live cells, measuring cellular membrane dynamics, and studying cholesterol-related processes.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-024-80958-2.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cholesterol</kwd><kwd>Fluorescent reporter</kwd><kwd>pH-sensitivity</kwd><kwd>Fluorescence microscopy</kwd><kwd>Membrane</kwd><kwd>Lipid rafts</kwd><kwd>Lipid droplets</kwd><kwd>Lysosomes.</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biochemistry</kwd><kwd>Sterols</kwd><kwd>Sterols</kwd><kwd>Fluorescent dyes</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R15GM147912-01</award-id><award-id>1R15GM147912-01</award-id><award-id>1R15GM147912-01</award-id><award-id>1R15GM147912-01</award-id><award-id>1R15GM147912-01</award-id><award-id>1R15GM147912-01</award-id><award-id>1R15GM147912-01</award-id><award-id>1R15GM147912-01</award-id><award-id>1R15GM147912-01</award-id><award-id>1R15GM147912-01</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Cholesterol is an indispensable lipid for all animal eukaryotic cells. It is a major membrane component, behaves as a cofactor for signaling molecules, and acts as a precursor for steroid hormones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Structurally, cholesterol influences membrane rigidity, permeability, and curvature. For membrane microdomains (a.k.a., lipid rafts), cholesterol is decisive to their biophysical property, which facilitates the localization and function of transmembrane signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The intracellular cholesterol trafficking between organelles is mediated by both vesicular and non-vesicular lipid transport mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Due to its involvement in numerous signaling pathways and cellular processes, cholesterol uptake, trafficking, and distribution are tightly regulated by complex mechanisms.</p><p id="Par3">Fluorescence imaging of cellular cholesterol has been achieved using cholesterol sensors, intrinsically fluorescent cholesterol analogs, or fluorescently labeled cholesterol derivatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The commonly used fluorescent cholesterol sensors are filipin (intrinsically fluorescent polyene antibiotic that binds to non-esterified cholesterol)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and fluorescently tagged perfringolysin O - particularly its domain 4 (D4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The application of filipin has a few drawbacks, including nonspecific binding to other lipids and permeabilization of cell membranes, which makes it unsuitable for live-cell applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Additionally, D4-like sensors suffer from their bulky size and potentially interfere with cholesterol behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Recently, a novel cholesterol sensor named GRAM-W was developed by Koh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This biosensor contains the GRAM domain from GRAMD1b. However, it recognizes not only cholesterol but also anionic lipids, such as phosphatidylserine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Existing fluorescent cholesterol analogs can be divided into intrinsically fluorescent sterols or fluorophore-tagged sterols. Due to its complex interaction with various biomolecules, tagged fluorophores likely affect cholesterol&#x02019;s functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Consequently, different fluorescent cholesterol analogs are tailored for specific studies. Natural fluorescent sterols have three conjugated double bonds in the steroid ring system (e.g., dehydroergosterol, DHE, and cholestatrienol, CTL). Their disadvantage is lackluster fluorescence, including cyto-damaging UV, excitation, and low quantum yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. DHE also has very limited environmental sensitivity. Although CTL is the closest fluorescent derivative of cholesterol, its fluorescence properties and photostability are similar to, if not worse than those of DHE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Fluorescently labeled sterol probes have fluorophores attached to either the steroid backbone or are in the form of fluorescent cholesteryl conjugates (esters). The two most commonly used ones are nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) and boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core containing fluorophores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. NBD is smaller than the bulky BODIPY group, and unlike BODIPY, NBD is environment-sensitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. On the other hand, BODIPY is a much brighter fluorophore. Modifying cholesterol&#x02019;s hydrophobic tail with NBD resulted in the creation of 25-NBD-Chol and 22-NBD-Chol conjugates, which were used in many cellular studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The BODIPY-cholesterol (Bchol) was developed to better mimic cholesterol since BODIPY is electrically neutral (has no permanent dipole moment) and much brighter than NBD. It has been widely recognized and used in many cellular assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, recent studies have shown that its intracellular trafficking significantly differs from that of cholesterol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The biological importance of cholesterol and the need of environment-sensitive analogs for cholesterol trafficking across cell membranes motivated us to develop new cholesterol probes. Here, we report a modular design for making fluorescent cholesterol analogs, a new class of cholesterol probes with spectral properties favorable for imaging and environmental sensitivity. Some of them are pH-sensitive and useful for tracking cholesterol trafficking among different organelles bearing different pH. By live-cell imaging, we showed that some of the new probes are better than Bchol in terms of photo properties and similarity to cholesterol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Reagents, solvents, and glassware</title><p> All reagents and solvents (including anhydrous ones) were obtained from commercial sources (Fisher Scientific) and used without purification unless otherwise noted.

To prepare the lipid mix (39.5% DOPC, 39.5% SM, 20.9% cholesterol, 0.1% DID, and 0.1% CND Dye), 34 &#x000b5;L of DOPC, 34 &#x000b5;L of SM, 18 &#x000b5;L of cholesterol, 10 &#x000b5;L of DiD, 22 &#x000b5;L of CND dye, were added to a single vial with a Hamilton syringe. An O-ring was placed at the center of the conductive side of the ITO glass and sealed with vacuum grease. 10 &#x000b5;L of the lipid mix was then added to the middle of the O-ring and air-dried. The ITO glass with the dried lipid mix was placed in a desiccator under vacuum for 1&#x000a0;h. For all aqueous solutions, Milli-Q grade water was filtered with a 0.22&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m pore size filter prior to use. After 1&#x000a0;h, a 230 &#x000b5;L solution of 50 mM sucrose was placed through a 0.22&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m pore-size filter onto the vacuum-dried lipid mix. The ITO glass was then placed onto the Vesicle Prep Pro (VPP) instrument with the conductive sides facing the sucrose/lipid mix solution. The automated VPP protocol was initiated, which began the initiation period of heating to 60&#x000b0; C for 10&#x000a0;min with the frequency set to 10&#x000a0;Hz and the voltage set to 0&#x000a0;V. After the initial 10&#x000a0;min, the voltage was increased to 3&#x000a0;V over a period of 5&#x000a0;min. This was followed by a 3-hour period of maintaining 10&#x000a0;Hz and 3&#x000a0;V for the electroformation of the vesicles to occur. After the 3-hour electroformation period a 20-minute period of decreasing the voltage to 0&#x000a0;V and the frequency to 5&#x000a0;Hz was performed. Finally, a 40-minute cooling period of the GUV solution to 23&#x000b0; C was performed to obtain the GUV solution. For imaging, the GUV solution was diluted in a 1:2 ratio (v: v) of GUV solution: sucrose. The imaging chamber (well) was prepared using a plastic (polypropylene) cap from HPLC injection vial that was greased and applied to a #1 glass coverslip. To that imaging chamber 20 &#x000b5;L of the diluted GUV solution was added. To make the vesicles suitable for imaging, 40 &#x000b5;L of Milli-Q filtered water was added to the well and incubated for 15&#x000a0;min. GUV images were obtained using a fluorescent laser confocal microscope Nikon A1R system using 20x objective. The excitation wavelength was set to 405&#x000a0;nm for CND detection with an emission detection range of 500 &#x02013;550&#x000a0;nm. For DiD, the excitation was performed at 640&#x000a0;nm with an emission range from 663 to 738&#x000a0;nm. Individual vesicle images were cropped out one by one from the raw images.

The membrane center was then calculated by adding the averaged values and dividing it by 2 to obtain a Z-value for the membrane center. The distance from the center of membrane (immersion) was calculated by subtracting the position of the selected atoms from the membrane center previously calculated. The hydrogen bonds were analyzed with VMD using the H-bond plugin. The number of H-bonds between the probe and membrane component (POPC, SM, water) was calculated using whole molecules as selection (e.g., POPC vs. CND) with a donor-acceptor cutoff distance of 3&#x000c5; and the angle cutoff of 30 degrees. The bonds were analyzed across the last 80 ns of trajectory on every frame. For the cholesterol H-bond analysis, the total number of bonds formed with water, SM, and POPC was calculated and divided by the number of cholesterol molecules in the system to obtain average values, which were rounded to the nearest whole number.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Animal protocols</title><p> All animal protocols followed NIH guidelines and were approved by Florida Atlantic University&#x02019;s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Cells were loaded with the desired probe to obtain a final dye concentration of 1 &#x000b5;M for 1&#x000a0;h and then incubated in dye-free media for desired periods of time until imaging.

In contrast, the Manders&#x02019; colocalization coefficient (MCC) directly measures co-occurrence regardless of signal proportionality. However, to employ MCC effectively, it&#x02019;s imperative to eliminate background noise from pixel intensities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. While subtracting a global threshold value is a common method, determining the appropriate threshold can be challenging. Costes et al. devised an efficient, robust, and reproducible approach to automatically identify the threshold value by analyzing the pixel values that yield a positive Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient (PCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. It iteratively measured PCC for different pixel intensity values until reaching values where PCC dropped to or below zero. The corresponding intensity values on the regression line were then utilized as thresholds for each channel. Only pixels surpassing both thresholds were considered colocalized. Consequently, the Costes&#x02019; method eliminates human bias. To determine both PPC and MCC, we used the EzColocalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> plugin available for ImageJ. Colocalization was performed between selected channels (e.g. CND vs. LysoView) within each Z-stack on a plane-by-plane basis in a batch mode, with Costes&#x02019; thresholding. PCC and MCC values were obtained from each slice in Z-stack. Data from 1&#x000a0;h to 24&#x000a0;h was then compared and plotted using GraphPad Prism (ver. 10).

The absorbance maxima for the analogs with nitrogen-substituted aliphatic rings at the C4 position (CND2-6, 9, and 10) are proximal to 405&#x000a0;nm, which is a common laser wavelength for excitation in fluorescent microscopy. Most of their emission maxima also nicely fall into the commonly used green channel (i.e., 500&#x02013;550&#x000a0;nm). The substitution at C4 with aliphatic ethanolamine results in obtaining analog (CND1) having red-shifted absorbance maxima (~&#x02009;420&#x02013;440&#x000a0;nm). The solvatochromic properties of the analogs can be illustrated by the Lippert-Mataga plot (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). To quantify solvatochromic properties, the maximum wavelengths of absorption and emission (&#x003bb;<sub>abs</sub>/&#x003bb;<sub>em</sub>) were obtained, and the Stokes&#x02019; shifts (&#x02206;&#x003bd;) were plotted as a function of solvent orientation polarizability (&#x02206;f) to obtain Lippert-Mataga (LM) plot (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The deviation of positive, linear correlations suggests that there are fluorophore-fluorophore or fluorophore-solvent interactions influencing the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process in the ground and excited states. CND7 is the only analog that does not exhibit detectable correlation, likely due to its poor spectral profile. With its UV absorbance (342&#x02013;346&#x000a0;nm) and near-zero fluorescence emission (440&#x02013;505&#x000a0;nm), CND7 was found to be undesirable for further microscopy studies as a probe. CND8 is the only probe with a hydroxyl group present at the C4 position. It also exhibits unique solvatochromic properties due to its hydroxyl (phenolic) group interacting strongly with polar protic solvents (MeOH and EtOH) through hydrogen bonds (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

</p><p id="Par36">To measure the depth of CND immersion into the lipid membrane, we calculated the distance between the cholesterol O3 atom and the middle point of the lipid bilayer for both Chol: POPC, 1:3 (25% Chol) and the SM: Chol: POPC, 1:1:2 systems (Fig. S4, left column). The immersion depth of other hydroxyl groups within certain CND probes, either in linkers (CND3, CND6) or head groups (CND1, CND8, CND9), was also calculated (Fig. S4, right column). Since the presence of SM lipids in the system influences membrane behavior (ordering) and increases the type of in-membrane interactions available for the probes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, the SM: Chol: POPC system caused more difference than the simpler Chol: POPC (1:3) system (comparing the top vs. the bottom plots in Fig. S4). In the SM: Chol: POPC system, the CND1, CND3, and CND8 were immersed in the membrane very similarly to cholesterol. CND10 is the least immersed, even less than cholesterol (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B), which is likely due to the electrostatic interactions of the carboxylate group with choline moiety from SM and POPC as well as the formation of hydrogen bonds with water (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C right). It seems that the 4-carboxypiperidine head group position carboxylate is at the right height with respect to the choline group to maximize these interactions. In terms of hydrogen bond formation with SM, CND1 performed the best (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C left). CND1 ethanolamine head group is water exposed and thus can form multiple hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups from phospholipids as well as water, which prevents CND1 from further immersion into the lipid bilayer. The interactions of CND8 and its hydroxyl head group also follow a similar pattern, which is the most pronounced with POPC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C middle). On the contrary, the hydroxyl group of CND9 (4-hydroxypiperidine head group) forms the least number of hydrogen bonds with water likely due to the very hydrophobic character of this head group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). It is also the reason that CND9 exhibits the deepest immersion among all analogs tested (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). The analogs containing piperazine head groups (i.e., CND2, 3 and 4) also show electrostatic interactions with the phosphate groups of phospholipids, although their immersion depth mostly depends on their linkers (Movie S1). CND4 with &#x003b2;-alanine linker shows the second deepest immersion in the membrane (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B&#x00026;C), as such linker enables for great flexibility and stretchability between naphthalimide moiety and the cholesterol residue. CND2&#x02019;s glycine linker is slightly shorter and more constrained than the &#x003b2;-alanine one (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). The side chain hydroxyl group of serine linker (e.g., CND3) has a strong effect on its membrane immersion. It allows for additional hydrogen bond interactions with surrounding lipids and water and thus better imitating the behavior of native cholesterol&#x02019;s hydroxyl group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Such effect is also evident when comparing CND5 to CND6, which have the same head group (i.e., morpholine) but glycine and serine as linker respectively. Notably, the morpholine head group also affects the membrane behavior of CNDs compared to piperazine moiety. Together, our simulation in SM: Chol: POPC membrane qualitatively agrees with that of GUV results in which CND3, CND8, and CND1 showed the most L<sub>o</sub> partitioning (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par37">The immersion depth and cholesterol tilt angle of NBD containing cholesterol analogs (22NBD, 25NBD, and 3HxNBD) was comparable with that of CND1, CND3, and CND8, and the ester-containing 3HxNBD had the deepest immersion in the membrane (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B).

S5 and S6, some showed poor cellular uptake (e.g., CND5) while others exhibited strong staining (e.g., CND1, CND2-4); some showed more diffusing pattern in cells (e.g., CND1) while others exhibited punctuated labeling (e.g., CND2-4); some distributed in all parts of cells (e.g., CND6, CND9,) while others concentrated near nuclei (e.g., CND3).</p><p id="Par39">To generate masks for fluorescent puncta quantification, we used a machine learning approach implemented in Weka trainable segmentation (Fig. S7)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. We quantified the accumulation of probes by counting the fluorescent puncta per cell across both cell types and both time points (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C). Notable patterns emerged. In astrocytes, CNDs with piperazine head groups (CND2, CND3, and CND4) showed a more significant number of fluorescent puncta in cells at both 1 and 24&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C, S7), indicating that the head group may be the primary factor influencing their uptake and accumulation. In 3T3 cells, a similar pattern was observed. Notably, Bchol and CND6 were taken up more efficiently in 3T3 cells than in astrocytes.</p><p id="Par40">

</p><p id="Par41">When examining analogs with morpholine head groups, we noticed that the linker also influences the probe uptake. In both cell types, CND6, featuring a serine linker, showed significantly more uptake and intracellular accumulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C and S6, S7). Interestingly, in 3T3 cells, CND6 displayed a high number of fluorescent puncta at 1&#x000a0;h but decreased dramatically at 24&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and S7). This suggests higher efflux or degradation of CND6 by fibroblast cells. Similar but less pronounced patterns were observed in astrocytes. CND5, with a glycine linker, exhibited the least uptake (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C and S6, S7), likely due to its overall low solubility and propensity to aggregate in an aqueous solution.</p><p id="Par42">Neutral CNDs with hydroxyl-containing head groups (CND1, 8, and 9) generally had fewer fluorescent puncta compared to those with piperazine head groups, CND2-CND4 (Fig. S7). However, CND1, CND8, and CND9 shared a similar uptake behavior as CND6 in 3T3 cells. In astrocytes, the patterns were the opposite, with CND8 and 9 showing more accumulation and CND1 exhibiting less. CND10, with a negatively charged carboxylate head group, exhibited a comparable distribution pattern in both cell types, accumulation after 24&#x000a0;h, but the degree of that accumulation was more pronounced in astrocytes.</p><p id="Par43">Analyzing cell-wide probe distribution in astrocytes reveals distinct results (Fig. S5 and S7). For CND2-4, the fluorescent puncta were scattered across the cell at 1&#x000a0;h and became more perinuclear at 24&#x000a0;h. CND8, 9, and 10 exhibited a different pattern where the puncta not only became more defined after 24&#x000a0;h but also showed reduced fluorescence throughout the cells. CND1 presented yet another distinct pattern, i.e., puncta were well-defined at 1&#x000a0;h and became less intense (more diffused throughout the cells) by 24&#x000a0;h. Bchol, also accumulated as fluorescent puncta, was more dispersed and remained so even 24&#x000a0;h after loading (Fig. S5).</p><p id="Par44">Next, we measured the size of the fluorescent puncta. While the majority of them were approximately 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in diameter, there was a significant variation in size, as depicted in Fig. S9. In 3T3 cells, the puncta sizes were generally large for all CNDs except those with free hydroxyl head groups (CND6, 8, and 9). In astrocytes, however, the largest increase in puncta size was seen with CNDs that have piperazine head groups (CND2-4). This size increase was also noted for hydroxyl-containing head group analogs (CND8 and 9) and the negatively charged CND10. We further compared the accumulation of probes within the fluorescent puncta by assessing the average fluorescence intensity within individual particles (Fig. S10). As a reference, Bchol exhibited high average intensity in both cell types, slightly more in 3T3 cells. The fluorescent puncta of CNDs with positively charged head groups (CND2-4) exhibited a strikingly higher average intensity.</p><p id="Par45">To determine the nature of those fluorescence puncta, we performed co-labeling with LysoView (a commercially available marker selective for lysosomes) and Nile red (typically used to label lipid droplets)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. By comparing co-staining between 1-hr and 24-hour time points, Bchol shows accumulation in lysosomes and lipid droplets that increases over time in both cell types (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> &#x00026; S8). This observation aligns with existing literature in which Bchol was found in lipid droplets inside CHO and HeLa cells and this accumulation was attributed to its BODIPY group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Bchol accumulated in lysosomes after prolonged incubation was also reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Like Bchol, we also observed CNDs&#x02019; co-localization with LysoView and Nile red, which increased over time as well. Notably, the degrees of co-localizations at different time points vary among different CNDs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility of nonspecific labeling, particularly by Nile red<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, it is likely that CNDs, just like Bchol enter both lysosomes and lipid droplets over time. It is also possible that some lipid droplets and lysosomes are spatially too close to be distinguished by fluorescence imaging.</p><p id="Par46">CNDs with piperazine head groups (i.e., CND2-4) exhibit pH sensitivity, allowing them to report luminal pH in organelles like endosomes and lysosomes. To demonstrate this, we used CND3, which has the highest pH sensitivity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In astrocytes, we co-loaded CND3 with human Transferrin conjugated to Alexa568, which is known to label endosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. After 1-hour incubation and washing, those astrocytes were subjected to live-cell imaging. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, there is a strong similarity between CND3 and Transferrin-Alexa568 signals. A weaker and more diffused staining of CND3 can be attributed to its localization on the plasma membrane. We perfused those astrocytes with three different Tyrode&#x02019;s solutions, i.e., normal (pH 7.3), acidic (pH 5.5), and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (50mM). While the first two primarily affect extracellular pH, the last neutralizes all luminally acidic organelles like endosomes and lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, the application of acidic Tyrode&#x02019;s solution caused a significant increase of CND3 fluorescence, more prominent in its diffusing labeling, i.e., surface CND3. When NH<sub>4</sub>Cl was applied, a significant decrease of CND3 fluorescence was observed, consistent with the neutralization of endosomes. In either case, the fluorescence of Transferrin-Alexa568 showed little change because it is pH-insensitive. Therefore, we conclude that pH-sensitive CNDs can serve as membrane-based pH reporters for surface and organelles&#x02019; lumen.</p><p id="Par47">

</p><p id="Par50">Resulting analogs can be categorized into three groups, depending on the nature of the head group: neutral (CND5, CND6), neutral but bearing a hydroxyl group (CND1, CND8, CND9), and charged (CND2-CND4, CND10). Each of them was assessed for its solvatochromic behavior in organic solvents and model membranes. The unique photophysical properties of CNDs make them more useful in live-cell fluorescence imaging than NBD- and BODIPY-conjugated cholesterol probes. Particularly, they have much larger Stokes shifts (~&#x02009;130&#x000a0;nm) than NBD-conjugated probes (~&#x02009;40&#x000a0;nm) and Bchol (~&#x02009;10&#x000a0;nm), which is particularly beneficial for co-imaging with other fluorescent probes.</p><p id="Par51">Our results testify that the head group character has the greatest impact on the fluorescence of the 1,8-naphthalimide scaffold, photoproperties, and cellular labeling. The neutral CNDs, with morpholine head group (CND5, CND6), exhibit elevated aggregation in water and enhanced fluorescence of these aggregates due to the AIE effect. The limited solubility of the neutral analogs results in a lower cellular uptake compared to positively charged analogs. It also affects the probes&#x02019; partitioning in the lipid membrane, as shown by computer simulations and GUV tests. The employed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations provided a putative explanation of how CNDs behave in model membranes compared to cholesterol and helped us understand the role of linkers and head groups in the intramolecular interactions with other lipids in the membrane. To imitate the diverse lipid environments found in different types of cellular membranes, we have adopted five different membrane models in the simulations. As anticipated, the presence of cholesterol and SM lipids in the system influences membrane behavior (ordering) and increases the type of in-membrane interactions available for the probes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. We found that the SM: Chol: POPC membrane system showed better probe differentiation than the simpler Chol: POPC (1:3) system (comparing the top vs. the bottom plots in Fig. S4). That system also better reflected the experimental GUV data for probe partitioning into the L<sub>o</sub> phase. In the experiments using GUVs, the neutral CNDs morpholine head group had the lowest L<sub>o</sub> coefficient. The MD simulations revealed that the neutral analogs exhibit higher than average cholesterol tilt angles and deeper immersion in the membrane. In these analogs, the naphthalimide moiety tends to reside in the hydrophobic environment of lipid membranes.</p><p id="Par52">The relatively hydrophobic nature and the resulting behavior of the neutral analogs containing the morpholine group can be improved by the incorporation of the hydroxyl group in the linker module. When glycine (CND5) is replaced with serine, the resulting compound (CND6) becomes more soluble. Moreover, such change has little effect on L<sub>o</sub> partitioning but significantly improves membrane immersion depth. The difference between CND5 and CND6 is also evident in cell uptake results, especially in 3T3 fibroblasts. The CND6 produced a large number of fluorescent puncta 1&#x000a0;h after incubation. The significant clearance of CND6 at 24&#x000a0;h can be attributed to probe efflux (for example, by the ABC transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>) or degradation of CND6.</p><p id="Par53">The CND9 analog, which contains a relatively hydrophobic 4-hydroxypiperazine head group, highlights the importance of the hydroxyl moiety, a characteristic feature of the second category of neutral CND probes. Compared with CND5 and CND6, its L<sub>o</sub> partitioning is better, likely due to the presence of an H-bonding hydroxyl group. Its relatively low fluorescence is compensated for by better uptake and membrane distribution at the 24-hour time point. Other analogs containing hydroxyl head groups, such as CND1 and CND8, follow the same trend. With its phenolic character, the hydroxyl group modifies the fluorescence properties of the ND scaffold in CND8. The same applies to CND1 and its ethanolamine head group. These probes do not exhibit AIE, in contrast to CND5 and CND6. The low membrane immersion depth demonstrates that the hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen bonding. CND8 and CND1 also partition well into the L<sub>o</sub> phase, similar to CND3. These analogs were taken up by the cells and exhibited the same distribution pattern after 24&#x000a0;h, although CND1&#x02019;s fluorescent puncta were relatively less visible in astrocytes, suggesting either more clearance or more diffused distribution. Clearly, as computer simulations show, the presence of a hydroxyl group increases the hydrogen bonding of these analogs, not only with water but also with other lipids in the membrane. CND1 formed the most hydrogen bonds with SM, while CND8 did so with POPC. These bonds are not only more frequent but also long-lasting.</p><p id="Par54">Analogs containing polarizable piperazine head groups (CND2, CND3, CND4) represent a novel class of pH-sensitive fluorescent cholesteryl probes. The piperazine head group exhibits not only substantial AIE inhibition but also pH-dependent fluorescence change. Such pH sensitivity is very valuable since various organelles in the endosomal pathway contain cholesterol and exhibit different luminal pH (e.g., ~pH 6 in endosomes and ~&#x02009;pH 4.5 in lysosomes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Hence, those pH-sensitive CNDs are useful for mapping out pH variance across different organelles in different types of cells, similar to the previously reported ND6 probe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. Moreover, such pH-sensitive cholesterol probes or lipid probes, in general, are very helpful in imaging the exo-/endocytosis of synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup> and endosomal trafficking in general, bearing great promise in studying cholesterol-related disorders like Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. The pH sensitivity of these analogs correlates with the exposure of the piperazine moiety to the aqueous environment, which also improves hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions with other phospholipids.</p><p id="Par55">On the contrary, the negatively charged CND10 analog containing 4-carboxypiperazine is not pH-sensitive and differs significantly from the positively charged CNDs. Our simulation shows that the carboxylate moiety allows CND10 to immerse in the membrane less than cholesterol does while making the most contact with water among the analogs tested. However, the negatively charged carboxylate does not improve partitioning into the L<sub>o</sub> phase. It also shows much lower cell uptake and fluorescence than the positively charged analogs.</p><p id="Par56">Interestingly, the simulation data show that the immersion depth in the membrane among CND2-CND4 is influenced by the nature of the linker. The flexible &#x003b2;-alanine linker causes CND4 to immerse in the membrane the most. The glycine linker is more constrained than the &#x003b2;-alanine linker but less constrained than the serine linker. In contrast, the latter contains an additional hydroxyl group that facilitates not only pH sensitivity but also L<sub>o</sub> partitioning. Our best analog, CND3, with its Lo partitioning of ~&#x02009;50%, is comparable to Bchol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Different tests collectively demonstrate that, in general, the introduction of a hydroxyl group into the linker structure significantly enhances lipid partitioning performance. As previously mentioned, the improved properties are also evident in the case of CND5 and CND6. The piperazine-containing CND2-CND4 analogs clearly outperformed all other CNDs in terms of fluorescent signal intensity in live cell imaging. Not only are they readily taken up by the cells, but they also accumulate over time, showing no toxicity, as judged by cell morphology. The distinct staining patterns suggest that the nature of the head group is likely the primary factor determining probe uptake and accumulation.</p><p id="Par57">We think that certain CNDs (i.e., CND1, CND2-4, CND6, CND8), by functional and structural resemblance, may be used to track intracellular sterol transportation <italic>via</italic> endosomal pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>, possibly by interactions with caveolae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. In addition, those CNDs may also be useful in illustrating cholesterol exchange between lipid droplets and endosomes/lysosomes through vesicular and non-vesicular pathways.</p><p id="Par58">Considering the central role of lysosomes and their participation in subcellular cholesterol distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>, we deployed colocalization analysis for CNDs and LysoView (or Nile red). Similarly to Bchol, the colocalization of CNDs with both LysoView and Nile red increased over time, although the degree of co-localization at different time points varies among different CNDs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B and S8). It is highly likely that CNDs, just like Bchol, translocate to both lysosomes and lipid droplets at 1 and 24&#x000a0;h. This is consistent with the fact that most cholesterol taken up by cells ends up in lysosomes and lipid droplets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par59">Given the nonspecific labeling by the Nile red<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, and the crowded intracellular puncta, we cannot exclude the possibility that some CNDs are more exclusive for lysosomes or lipid droplets. It is also possible that lipid droplets laden with CNDs undergo autophagy, and end up in autophagosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>, causing the overlapping of the two organelle markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>. Our analysis further revealed that pH-sensitive analogs (CND2-CND4) exhibited a 2-3-fold increase in fluorescence intensity after 24&#x000a0;h compared to other CNDs (Fig. S10). Such a substantial surge in fluorescence intensity could be due to their accumulation in autolysosomes, where the acidic environment inhibits the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process in the naphthalimide group, resulting in amplified fluorescence. It seems rather unlikely that the increased intensity of CND2-CND4 is simply due to the accumulation of these analogs in lipid droplets or AIE because they are much less aggregable. In future studies, the subcellular distribution of CNDs, especially among endosomes, lysosomes, and lipid droplets, can be better elucidated by using highly specific organelle markers, as well as different loading methods (e.g., using methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin or LDL complexes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par60">In summary, we have successfully developed a novel class of fluorescent cholesteryl probes, incorporating a 1,8-naphthalimide (ND) scaffold known for its excellent solvatochromic and fluorescence properties. These CND probes demonstrate remarkable versatility and functionality, enabling the detailed study of cholesterol dynamics within cellular membranes. The modular design of these probes, which allows for incorporating various head groups and linkers, provides a robust toolbox for investigating membrane environments and cholesterol trafficking. Our findings highlight the unique advantages of CND probes, including their large Stokes shifts and environment-sensitive fluorescence, which outperform traditional NBD- and BODIPY-conjugated cholesterol probes in several key aspects. Notably, the pH-sensitive CND analogs (CND2, CND3, and CND4) represent a significant advancement in the field of fluorescent cholesterol probes. Their ability to map pH changes across different organelles provides new ways for studying intracellular processes and cholesterol-related disorders. Additionally, the specific interactions and behaviors of CND1, CND6, and CND8 suggest their potential as tools for elucidating intracellular cholesterol trafficking and distribution. Our molecular dynamics simulations provide valuable insights into the interactions between CND probes and lipid membranes, further validating their utility in mimicking cholesterol behavior. The in vitro testing in 3T3 fibroblasts and mouse astrocytes confirms the efficacy and non-toxicity of these probes, paving the way for their application in live-cell imaging and beyond. The introduction of these environment-sensitive CND probes is anticipated to impact the study of membrane biology, lipid dynamics, and cellular targeting. We expect that these compounds will enhance our understanding of cholesterol-related processes and cellular membrane dynamics and find applications in drug delivery systems and other areas of biomedical research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
