The present study aims to explore the effects of different nitrogen fertilizer types viz., NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> (N1) and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (N2) and planting densities, viz., D1: 30 &#x000d7; 10 cm, D2: 20 &#x000d7; 20 cm, and D3: 30 &#x000d7; 20 cm, on growth and development, nitrogen absorption and utilization, and yield formation. The salt-tolerant rice variety &#x02018;Jingliangyou 3261&#x02019; was exposed to 0.3% salt irrigation water. Results revealed that N2 substantially improved the rice yield by increasing the number of effective panicles and the rate of grain-setting compared to N1. In addition, the N2 also increased leaf chlorophyll content, dry matter accumulation, antioxidant enzyme activity such as superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase activity and reduced the content of malondialdehyde. In comparison with N1, the N2 treatment resulted in an increase of 12.21%, 31.89%, and 37.53% in total nitrogen accumulation, nitrogen recovery efficiency (NRE), and nitrogen agronomic efficiency (NAE), respectively. This increase can be attributed to enhanced leaf nitrogen metabolic enzyme activity, including nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase, and a more robust root system. Under N1 and N2 conditions, compared to D3, D1 resulted in an increase in the number of tillers but decreased the percentage of productive tillers, the grains per panicle, the grain-filling rate, and the thousand-grain weight, thereby reducing yield. Additionally, the D3 treatment also significantly improved NRE and NAE compared to the D1 treatment. Therefore, the rational selection of nitrogen fertilizer type (N2) and planting density (D3) is crucial for improving the yield and nitrogen use efficiency of salt-tolerant rice. This would broaden the scope of agricultural solutions for saline soils, potentially improving food security in regions where soil salinization is a widespread issue.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nitrogen forms</kwd><kwd>nitrogen use efficiency</kwd><kwd>planting density</kwd><kwd>salt stress</kwd><kwd>salt-tolerant rice</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>32372221</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Plan Project</funding-source><award-id>2024NK1010</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Saline-alkali Resistant Rice Technology Innovation Construction</funding-source><award-id>2024ZYT002</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>National Natural Science Foundation of China (32372221), Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Plan Project (2024NK1010) and National Saline-alkali Resistant Rice Technology Innovation Construction (2024ZYT002) funded this project.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-plants-14-00501"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Global climate change and unsustainable land use have made soil salinization a major environmental factor restricting agricultural production. Currently, more than 833 million hectares of land are affected by salinization worldwide [<xref rid="B1-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], with over 10% of farmland impacted, posing a serious threat to global food security [<xref rid="B2-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Rice (<italic toggle="yes">Oryza sativa</italic> L.), as one of the most important food crops in the world, is particularly vulnerable to salt stress, which significantly reduces its yield and quality [<xref rid="B3-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. High salt concentrations cause water imbalance, ion toxicity, and osmotic stress in plants, adversely affecting their growth and development [<xref rid="B5-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Developing salt-tolerant rice varieties is a key strategy to enhance rice yield under salt stress conditions [<xref rid="B7-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], as the yield reduction of salt-tolerant rice varieties is significantly lower than that of salt-sensitive rice varieties [<xref rid="B8-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Salt-tolerant rice varieties are capable of maintaining normal physiological mechanisms, including ionic homeostasis and osmotic adjustments, as well as growth and development under saline conditions [<xref rid="B9-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, salt-tolerant varieties have improved antioxidant defense systems to eliminate reactive oxygen species, thus protecting cells from oxidative damage [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Under salt stress conditions, salt-tolerant rice varieties exhibit superior agronomic traits, such as plant height, tiller number, and aboveground dry biomass, with significantly lower declines compared to salt-sensitive varieties [<xref rid="B8-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although salt-tolerant rice achieves higher yields, however, overall rice production is still reduced [<xref rid="B12-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, implementing effective cultivation practices in the future could further enhance the yield of salt-tolerant rice under salt stress conditions.</p><p>Nitrogen (N) is one of the essential nutrients for plant growth and has a significant impact on the development, growth, and yield formation of crops [<xref rid="B13-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Under salt stress conditions, the absorption and utilization efficiency of N by plants is limited, which in turn affects growth and yield [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Previous studies have primarily focused on increasing N application to improve the salt tolerance of rice. For example, Chen et al. [<xref rid="B15-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found that the highest rice yield was achieved with 300 kg N hm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, while excess N application did not promote further yield increases. At varying salinity levels, an insufficient N supply negatively impacts the morphological and physiological characteristics of rice roots, significantly inhibiting leaf photosynthesis and ultimately reducing rice yield [<xref rid="B15-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, optimizing planting density and fertilizer management is a crucial strategy for improving rice yield under salt stress conditions. For example, with N application rates below 300 kg N hm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, reducing planting density can enhance rice yield and improve grain quality [<xref rid="B16-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, Guo et al. [<xref rid="B17-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported an improvement in rice yield at 0&#x02013;180 kg N hm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> with the increase in planting density. However, the yield was the highest at 150 kg N hm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and then decreased with increased N application. Zhu et al. [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] confirmed that reducing N fertilizer use while increasing planting density can enhance N absorption and accumulation. However, there has been limited research on the effects of varying planting densities under different N forms on rice yield, as well as N absorption and utilization efficiency.</p><p>N exists in the soil in various forms, including ammonium N (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), nitrate N (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>), and organic N [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Plant roots mainly absorb N in inorganic and organic forms, with inorganic N primarily being absorbed and utilized in the form of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> [<xref rid="B15-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B19-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The utilization efficiency of different N forms by plants varies, and their effectiveness is influenced by salt stress. For instance, Nathawat et al. [<xref rid="B20-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] demonstrated that, compared to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> significantly improved the salt tolerance of mustard (<italic toggle="yes">Brassica juncea</italic>), with a marked increase in biomass. Sehar et al. [<xref rid="B21-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] found that supplying NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> increased the biomass of wheat under salt stress and enhanced its osmotic stress resistance. Previous studies have focused on the optimization of N application rates to improve salt stress tolerance in plants; however, few reports are available on the application of different types of N fertilizers in integration with varying planting densities to improve the growth, yield, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in salt-tolerant rice. Therefore, the present study was conducted to assess the effects of different N fertilizer types and planting density on the morpho-physiological attributes, yield formation and NUE of salt-tolerant rice under salt stress conditions. The findings of this study are important in order to provide a scientific foundation for N management in salt-tolerant rice, aiming to enhance its yield and stability in saline conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-plants-14-00501"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-plants-14-00501"><title>2.1. Experimental Conditions and Details</title><p>The field experiment was conducted from April to August 2024 at the experimental base at the National Salt-Tolerant Rice Technology Innovation Center in Leyi Village, Hainan Province (108.90&#x02032; E, 18.44&#x02032; N). The experimental treatments were arranged in a split-plot design with different forms of N fertilizers (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> (in the form of calcium nitrate, with a N content of 11%) (N1) and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (in the form of ammonium sulfate, with a N content of 21%) (N2) being assigned to main plots with three different transplanting densities: D1 (30 cm &#x000d7; 10 cm, 332,000 hills per hm<sup>2</sup>); D2 (20 cm &#x000d7; 20 cm, 250,000 hills per hm<sup>2</sup>); and D3 (30 cm &#x000d7; 20 cm, 167,000 hills per hm<sup>2</sup>); two seedlings of a salt-tolerant rice variety i.e., &#x02018;Jingliangyou&#x02019;, per hill were assigned to sub-plots in triplicate. The salt-tolerant rice variety &#x02018;Jingliangyou3261&#x02019; can be found at this link: <uri xlink:href="https://www.ricedata.cn/variety/varis/631150.htm">https://www.ricedata.cn/variety/varis/631150.htm</uri> (accessed on 1 January 2022). The total amount of nitrogen (N) fertilizer was fixed at 150 kg hm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, according to the following formula: basal fertilizer:tillering fertilizer:panicle fertilizer:grain fertilizer = 4:3:2:1. Each treatment uniformly used slow-release urea as the basal fertilizer (slow-release urea was polyurethane resin coated slow-release urea N: 44%; the slow-release period was 60 d). The different nitrogen fertilizer types (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) were employed as topdressing fertilizers (comprising tillering and panicle fertilizer). Moreover, the present study also established a treatment without fertilization, with the aim of calculating NUE. The sub-plot size was 15 m<sup>2</sup>. A simulated saline stress environment was created through irrigation with 0.3% saltwater. Saline irrigation was applied 14 days after the tillering stage. The salinity stress was maintained continuously until the maturity stage of rice. Throughout the growth period, we regularly monitored soil salinity and supplemented with saltwater as needed to ensure the consistency of salinity stress. A conductivity instrument (2266FS, Spectrum, Middleton, WI, USA) was used to measure the salinity of water, and in cases of rainfall, the excess water was drained off from the fields and irrigate again as per requirement.

The results of the present study showed that the yield of rice when NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (N2) is used as a basal fertilizer is significantly higher than that under NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> (N1), with the main reason being the significant increase in the number of effective panicles and the grain-filling rate (<xref rid="plants-14-00501-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our findings are inconsistent with those of Yan et al.

Additionally, the N2 treatment maintained the chlorophyll content in the leaves during the later stages of growth and improved the total aboveground biomass during the HS stage, which possibly contributed to an increase in the number of effective panicles and the rate of grain-setting (<xref rid="plants-14-00501-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="plants-14-00501-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).

[<xref rid="B17-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found that under salt stress conditions, increasing planting density within the range of 0&#x02013;150 kg hm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> of fertilizer application can increase the number of effective panicles. This study is consistent with our findings, which showed that although high density could increase tiller density, it also reduced grains per panicle, the grain-filling rate, and the thousand-grain weight, thereby reducing yield (<xref rid="plants-14-00501-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="plants-14-00501-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, our study found that under salt stress conditions, increasing density also reduced productive tiller percentage, which may be related to intensified competition among rice plants under high-density planting conditions [<xref rid="B26-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This competition not only affects the tillering ability of rice but may also lead to uneven nutrient distribution of photo-assimilates [<xref rid="B27-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Additionally, excessive tillers consume a large amount of nutrients, reducing the nutrient resources for other tillers and leading to a decrease in the number of grains per panicle, the rate of grain-setting, and the thousand-grain weight [<xref rid="B28-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, lower planting density may also help improve light conditions and ventilation for rice, reduce the occurrence and spread of diseases, and possibly increase the stress resistance of rice [<xref rid="B29-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which is consistent with our findings, which show that in low-density conditions, the stress-resistant enzyme activity in rice leaves is significantly enhanced, and the MDA content is reduced. Therefore, optimization of planting density based on specific soil conditions, climate environment, rice varieties, and other factors is important to achieve high yield and quality in salt-tolerant rice.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-plants-14-00501"><title>4.2. Effects of Different N Forms and Planting Densities on the N Absorption and Utilization Efficiency of Salt-Tolerant Rice</title><p>This study also found that N2 exhibited a clear advantage in N absorption and utilization, whereas N2 demonstrated greater total nitrogen accumulation and NUE. In general, plants need to enhance their N absorption and utilization to sustain normal physiological processes, growth, and development under salt stress conditions [<xref rid="B15-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, due to its direct availability and unique metabolic characteristics within plants, may help promote N absorption and utilization in rice, thereby enhancing its salt tolerance [<xref rid="B32-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The results demonstrated that the activities of NR and GS in N2 treatment groups were significantly higher than those in N2 treatment groups during the PI stage (<xref rid="plants-14-00501-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). These findings imply that elevated nitrogen-related enzyme activities promoted the transformation of nitrogen, which consequently increased NUE. Furthermore, our study results indicate that root development with the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> treatment is superior to that with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> treatment (<xref rid="plants-14-00501-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In terms of root development, supplying NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> may result in poor root development, while supplying NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> has a smaller impact on the root system of rice [<xref rid="B33-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Under osmotic stress conditions, rice seedlings supplied with NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> have higher aquaporin activity, a greater number of lateral roots, and a lower density of aerenchyma, thus giving their roots a higher water absorption capacity and enhancing their tolerance to osmotic stress [<xref rid="B33-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>It has been reported that in rice production under normal conditions, high planting density is recommended to reduce N input [<xref rid="B34-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, compared to rice grown in non-saline fields, salt-affected rice requires higher N levels to enhance its salt tolerance. This is primarily because salinity negatively impacts the tillering ability of rice. Therefore, to ensure a reasonable and adequate population structure, both the fertilization rate (300 kg N hm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) and planting density must be increased for rice grown under saline&#x02013;sodic conditions [<xref rid="B36-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, due to ion competition, which can inhibit nutrient absorption and lead to significant nutrient loss, N use efficiency tends to be low [<xref rid="B16-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In our study, using NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-based fertilizers under low-density conditions (30 &#x000d7; 20) improved the salt tolerance of rice and promoted the accumulation of N in various parts. Additionally, low-density conditions facilitated the translocation of nutrients to the grains, increasing the proportion of N accumulation in the grains and thereby raising the NUE. At the same time, a lower planting density also improved the N absorption and utilization efficiency of rice. This is because a lower planting density reduces competition and shading among plants, allowing each plant to receive more light and access to nutritional space, which benefits root growth and development, as well as the absorption and utilization of soil nutrients [<xref rid="B26-plants-14-00501" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, under saline&#x02013;sodic conditions, providing an adequate amount of fertilizer and selecting the appropriate type of N fertilizer and planting density can enhance nutrient absorption and utilization that may ensures a synergistic increase in N use efficiency and yield.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-plants-14-00501"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Under salt stress conditions, the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> treatment significantly increased rice yield by enhancing the number of effective panicles and the grain-filling rate as well as improving chlorophyll content, dry matter accumulation, antioxidant enzyme activity, and reduced malondialdehyde content, thereby improving salt tolerance, as compared with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> treatment. High planting density increased total tillers while reduced the productive tiller percentage, grains per panicle, grain-filling rate, and thousand-grain weight, thus lowering yield. The NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> treatment also promoted better root systems and higher N-related enzyme activity, enhancing N absorption and transformation, especially under low-density planting. Therefore, combining NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> fertilizer with optimum plant density, i.e., 30 cm &#x000d7; 20 cm, could promote the grain yield and NUE of salt-tolerant rice under saline conditions. Building upon these findings, future research endeavors should focus on expanding the scope of investigation to encompass a broader range of salt concentrations and further refine the understanding of the interplay between nitrogen fertilizer types, planting densities, and salt stress.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors also would like to express their appreciation to all students and staff for their contributions to the execution of this research.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
