Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are immunomodulatory molecules expressed in various tissues, including the CNS. Here, we investigated whether the cathelicidin-related AMP (CRAMP) modulated the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. We showed that, at an early stage, CNS-recruited neutrophils produced neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) rich in CRAMP that were required for EAE initiation. NET-associated CRAMP stimulated IL-6 production by dendritic cells via the cGAS/STING pathway, thereby promoting encephalitogenic Th17 response.

In vitro, CRAMP<sub>1&#x02013;39</sub> regulated the activation of microglia and astrocytes through the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) 2. Finally, administration of butyrate, a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, stimulated the expression of neural CRAMP via the free fatty acids receptors 2/3 (FFAR2/3), and prevented EAE.

The hallmarks of MS include CNS infiltration by immune cells, activation of glial cells, multifocal demyelination, and axonal loss. The disease is influenced by multiple genetic polymorphisms and environmental factors including the intestinal microbiota, which is thought to play a critical role in the development of the disease (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). There is still no satisfying therapy for MS (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>A better understanding of the immune processes at play in MS has been achieved using the preclinical model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). EAE can be induced by immunization with various myelin antigens such as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) activating self-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 and 17 cells. Upon migration to the CNS, T cells initiate a local inflammatory response leading to axonal demyelination (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Innate immune cells such as microglia, dendritic cells, and macrophages play a critical role in this local inflammatory response (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>The relevance of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in autoimmunity is increasingly acknowledged. AMPs were discovered more than 40 years ago and represent a crucial component of the innate immune system in all living organisms (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). They are mainly produced at epithelial surfaces and protect against invading microorganisms while maintaining the homeostasis of the commensal microbiota (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). AMPs also have important immunomodulatory roles and can be either pro- or antiinflammatory depending on the context (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). For instance, AMPs play a role in the immunopathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases. AMPs from activated neutrophils can bind various TLR ligands and activate the immune system, contributing to the initiation of autoimmunity (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). A mechanism common to many autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases is the ability of cathelicidin from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), complexed with nucleic acids, to induce inflammatory cytokines from myeloid cells (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In contrast, AMPs secreted by nonimmune cells can prevent autoimmune responses by inducing various regulatory immune cell types, including regulatory macrophages and B cells, by engaging their receptors at the surface of these cells (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Emerging evidence suggests that AMPs are a part of the immune defense of the CNS (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). AMPs are expressed in the CNS of rodents and humans at a steady state, and their expression increases in the context of infection (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Following bacterial infection, cathelicidin-related AMP (CRAMP) is expressed in the CNS by recruited neutrophils, as well as by activated astrocytes, microglia, and meningeal cells (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In an experimental model of pneumococcal meningitis, mice deficient in CRAMP showed a higher degree of glial cell activation and CNS inflammation (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether CRAMP is expressed in the CNS during the development of EAE and whether it plays a critical role in controlling neuroinflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>CRAMP shows opposite roles during EAE.</title><p>As a starting point, we evaluated the expression of CRAMP in the CNS during the development of EAE in C57BL/6 WT mice. The mRNA expression of <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic>, encoding for CRAMP, increased in spinal cord (SC) during the course of EAE, peaking 12 days after immunization (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We observed that CFA was sufficient to induce <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic> mRNA expression in the CNS, suggesting that peripheral inflammation can trigger <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic> expression in the CNS (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI184502DS1" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI184502DS1</ext-link>). Importantly, CRAMP-deficient <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> C57BL/6 mice exhibited significantly reduced EAE scores (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that the expression of CRAMP was necessary for EAE development. To determine whether the absence of CRAMP prevented the initiation of the encephalitogenic T cell response in the periphery, we analyzed MOG<sub>35-55</sub>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells using MOG<sub>35-55</sub>/IAb tetramer staining. Seven days after immunization, the frequency of MOG<sub>35-55</sub>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) was comparable between WT and <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice, indicating that CRAMP did not play a role in the priming of autoreactive T cells in the periphery (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). To confirm the ability of <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice to mount an effective immune response, we immunized them with OVA and transferred CFSE-labeled OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> OT-II T cells. Five days after, analyzing OT-II T cell proliferation in the dLNs, we observed similar proliferation regardless of <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic> deficiency (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). Further supporting that CRAMP was not required for the initiation of the T cell response, 12 days after immunization, the frequency and number of MOG<sub>35-55</sub>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the SC were similar between WT and <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). However, the expression of IL-17 and IFN-&#x003b3; in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was reduced in <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice, supporting a local control of the encephalitogenic T cell response by CRAMP in CNS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). These data underline a role for CRAMP in the promotion of the pathogenic autoreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response in the CNS.</p><p>To further define the role of CRAMP in EAE, we injected recombinant CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> peptide i.p. in WT mice before the symptomatic phase (day 7) or at the peak of the disease (day 15). Surprisingly, the presymptomatic treatment reduced the severity of EAE, and therapeutic treatment at day 15 promoted EAE remission (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, F and G</xref>). Biodistribution experiments showed that Cy5-labeled CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> localized to the brain and SC 30 minutes after i.p. injection and remained at these sites for at least 24 hours (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). Similarly, local administration of CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> within the intrathecal (i.t.) space of the spine 9 days after EAE induction resulted in a comparable beneficial outcome (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). The expression of neurofilament light chain (NF-L) protein in the serum of i.t. CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub>-treated mice on day 15 was decreased compared with untreated mice, indicating reduced neuronal damage (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). In addition, i.t. CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> treatment decreased the activation of astrocytes and microglia in the SC, as shown by decreased expression of CD44 and CD86, respectively (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, J and K</xref>). The data obtained with CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> peptide administration suggest that these AMPs also have protective roles in EAE. We conclude that CRAMP might have antagonistic functions in EAE and proceeded with the investigation of these effects.</p></sec><sec><title>CRAMP is expressed in different cell types within the CNS during EAE.</title><p>We envisioned that the opposite effects of CRAMP in EAE might relate to its expression in different cell types. We thus analyzed the expression of CRAMP in the CNS at the peak of EAE using confocal microscopy. CRAMP was expressed in SC by MAP2<sup>+</sup> neurons and minimally by GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes, but predominantly by MAP2<sup>&#x02013;</sup>GFAP<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Neuronal expression of CRAMP was also observed in the NSC-34 motor neuron-like cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4A</xref>). CRAMP staining colocalized with synaptophysin, a marker of presynaptic vesicles, suggesting that CRAMP can be actively secreted by neurons. It is known that neutrophils infiltrate the CNS early during EAE (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). By confocal microscopy, we confirmed the massive infiltration of the SC by neutrophils after EAE induction. The expression of CRAMP by these neutrophils and the presence of NETs were observed in the SC at day 12 and the dLNs at day 7 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>, B and C). By flow cytometry, we confirmed the recruitment of CRAMP-expressing activated neutrophils (CD62L<sup>lo</sup>) in the CNS during the initiation of EAE while neutrophils remained nonactivated and did not express CRAMP at their surface in the BM from tibia (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The kinetic of surface CRAMP expression showed high expression in the neutrophils (CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>), peaking at day 10, mild expression in neurons (CD45<sup>&#x02013;</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup>) and microglia (CD45<sup>med</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>), peaking at day 15, and low expression in astrocytes (CD45<sup>&#x02013;</sup>GFAP<sup>+</sup>), peaking at day 15 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These data show that CRAMP was expressed in neutrophils and CNS-resident cells in the CNS during EAE. This was consistent with the hypothesis that the opposite effect of CRAMP on the disease could be explained by different cell sources.</p></sec><sec><title>CRAMP from neutrophils is essential for EAE.</title><p>To determine the functional role of CRAMP produced by neutrophils, we generated mice lacking <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic> specifically in this cell type (Mrp8-Cre<sup>Tg</sup>.<italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice) obtained by crossing Mrp8-Cre<sup>Tg</sup> and <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> C57BL/6 mice (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>, A and B). We observed that Mrp8-Cre<sup>Tg</sup>.<italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were almost resistant to EAE induction, recapitulating the phenotype observed in germline <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice and demonstrating the mandatory role of CRAMP from neutrophils for EAE development (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis of the immune infiltrate in the SC at the peak of the EAE in Mrp8-Cre<sup>Tg</sup>.<italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> and Mrp8-Cre<sup>neg</sup>.<italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> did not reveal significant differences in terms of cell number or cell types including neutrophils (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). However, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of the SC showed a reduced expression of the inflammatory cytokines <italic toggle="yes">Ifn&#x003b3;</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Il-17</italic>, as well as <italic toggle="yes">Il-6</italic>, in Mrp8-Cre<sup>Tg</sup>.<italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggested a local regulation of disease development that we next confirmed by transfer experiments. Indeed, the transfer of splenocytes from immunized Mrp8-Cre<sup>Tg</sup>.<italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> or Mrp8-Cre<sup>neg</sup>.<italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice into C57BL/6 mice induced EAE to the same extent (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). However, the transfer of splenocytes from immunized C57BL/6 mice induced EAE in Mrp8-Cre<sup>neg</sup>.<italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice but not as effectively in Mrp8-Cre<sup>Tg</sup>.<italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), even though the transfer of splenocytes from immunized C57BL/6 CD45.1 mice into Mrp8-Cre<sup>neg</sup>.<italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> or Mrp8-Cre<sup>Tg</sup>.<italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice showed no difference in terms of migration of the transferred T cells into the SC and the brain (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). These data supported the notion that CRAMP from neutrophils promoted EAE development locally in the CNS rather than in the periphery.</p></sec><sec><title>CRAMP from NETs favors encephalitogenic T cell response.</title><p>During EAE, we observed infiltration of CRAMP<sup>+</sup> NETting neutrophils in the CNS (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4B</xref>). Previous studies have shown that NETs contribute via various pathways to the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, including CNS pathologies (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). To investigate the role of NETs in EAE development, we administrated the pan-peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) inhibitor Cl-amidine subcutaneously to WT mice to inhibit NET formation during EAE. We observed that blocking NET formation from day 7 to day 17 after EAE induction significantly reduced disease severity (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) and the circulating level of NF-L (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Similarly, neutrophil depletion with anti-Ly6G mAb during the same period also resulted in reduced EAE severity (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). To determine the direct effect of NETs on encephalitogenic T cell response, we produced and isolated NETs in vitro from WT and <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> neutrophils. We observed that WT and <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> neutrophils were able to form NETs similarly (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We added NETs to a culture of splenocytes isolated from EAE-immunized WT mice. WT NETs stimulated the expression of IL-6, IL-23, and IL-17 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), consistent with previous reports demonstrating that NETs promote Th17 response (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, CRAMP-deficient NETs failed to promote Th17 response when added to splenocytes from EAE-immunized C57BL/6 mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). CRAMP is known to promote myeloid immune cell responses to self-nucleic acids released during NETosis by binding and transporting nucleic acids into the cells and enabling their recognition by intracellular sensors such as TLR9, Aim2, or cGAS/STING (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). To confirm this, we generated bone marrow&#x02013;derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and stimulated them with NETs in the presence of TDI-6570, a specific cGAS inhibitor, or the ODN A151, a multi-specific TLR9, AIM2, and cGAS antagonist. We observed that NETs stimulated IL-6 from BMDCs and this stimulatory effect was abolished by TDI-6570 and A151 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Taken together, these data show that CRAMP from CNS-infiltrating neutrophils appeared to be a key molecule promoting EAE development by stimulating the local encephalitogenic Th17 response, possibly via the cGAS/STING pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>CRAMP from neurons dampens EAE.</title><p>As we identified CRAMP expression in neurons, we wanted to determine the functional role of this neural CRAMP on EAE development. To achieve this objective, we performed i.t. injection in WT mice with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) expressing <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic> shRNA or scramble shRNA sequence under the U6 promoter to knockdown of <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic> expression by neurons (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>). AAV9-sh<italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic> were i.t. injected 7 days before EAE induction in order to selectively reach neurons and not CNS-infiltrating cells. We observed that prophylactic knockdown of <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic> expression in the SC significantly exacerbated the severity of EAE, supporting a protective role for CRAMP from neurons (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, the oral treatment of WT mice with butyrate, a gut microbiota-derived short chain fatty acid (SCFA) known to induce cathelicidin in several tissues (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), induced CRAMP expression in the CNS at steady state (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) and showed protective effect against EAE (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).

Other SCFAs, acetate and propionate, also stimulated CRAMP expression in the CNS after oral administration but not significantly (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 7B</xref>). Finally, in vitro experiments using the NSC-34 neuScale rons, showed that in vivo, butyrate, but not acetate or propionate, induced <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic> expression in neurons. Importantly, using a specific antagonist GLPG 0974, we showed that the stimulatory effect of butyrate on neurons was mediated through the free fatty acid receptor 2/3 (FFAR2/3) receptors (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>To molecularly define the regulatory effect of CRAMP on the encephalitogenic response, we added growing doses of CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> on splenocyte culture from EAE-immunized WT mice and we observed a significant reduction in a dose-dependent manner of the expression of IL-17, CCL-2, and IL-6 while IFN-&#x003b3; expression was poorly impacted (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Notably, these inhibitory effects were observed when CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> was applied at 10 &#x003bc;g/mL, which caused little toxicity in the treated cultures, whereas the expression of all cytokines decreased at the dose of 30 &#x003bc;g/mL, because this high concentration of CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> killed all cells (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>). Accordingly, the transfer of splenocytes from MOG<sub>35-55</sub>-immunized C57BL/6 mice cultured in the presence of CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> (10 &#x003bc;g/mL) was less efficient at inducing EAE in C57BL/6 mice compared with control splenocytes not exposed to CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Together, these data suggested a model where CRAMP from neurons can control the encephalitogenic response locally.</p></sec><sec><title>CRAMP dampens microglia and astrocyte activation.</title><p>IL-6, IL-23, and CCL2 are critical cytokines and chemokines expressed by microglia, the CNS-resident macrophages (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and are known to promote the expansion of encephalitogenic Th17 cells during EAE (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Cathelicidin is known to modulate the phenotype of myeloid immune cells as an example preventing the activation of macrophages by TLR ligands (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that CRAMP prevented microglial activation during EAE, leading to poor Th17 response. To address this question, we isolated primary microglia and cultured them with CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub>. Using microglia from <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice, we observed that exogenous CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> efficiently targeted microglia cells and localized in both their membrane as well as their cytoplasm (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Importantly, CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> reduced the production of the pro-Th17 cytokines CCL2, IL-6, and IL-23 by LPS-activated microglia (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). By using specific antagonists for receptors known to interact with CRAMP and to be expressed by microglia, we determined that CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> mediated its regulatory effect through the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), rather than the purinergic ionotropic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 9</xref>, A and B). In addition, CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> also reduced microglial activation induced by a cocktail of IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1;, and this regulatory effect was FPR2 dependent (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 9C</xref>). Using primary astrocyte cultures, we demonstrated a similar ability of CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> to target this cell type and to decrease inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, CCL2) induced by LPS via FPR2 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, D and E</xref>). These results supported that CRAMP from neurons or exogenous CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> had a protective effect against neuroinflammation. It did so by inhibiting the activation of microglia and astrocytes through the proresolving receptor FPR2 and subsequently dampening the encephalitogenic Th17 response.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data reveal that CRAMP exerts opposite roles in neuroinflammation depending on its cellular source (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 10</xref>). During EAE initiation, CRAMP is expressed locally by CNS-infiltrating neutrophils. Conditional knockout mice unambiguously show that CRAMP from neutrophils is mandatory for the initiation of EAE. Our in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that NET-associated CRAMP stimulates pro-Th17 response via the cGAS/STING pathway. Recent studies support a role for neutrophils in MS (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Circulating neutrophils in MS patients show a primed phenotype likely preceding their recruitment in the CNS where they may contribute to local inflammation. In addition, myeloperoxidase (MPO) bound to DNA, which is considered a common marker of NETs, and was found elevated in serum in MS patients (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In plasma, measures of neutrophil-associated factors NE, CXCL1, and CXCL5 correlate with MS lesion burden and clinical disability (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Molecular studies identified mRNA from the neutrophil-specific protein ASPRV1 in brain lesions, with higher amounts in severe MS compared with mild or moderate forms, and normal-appearing white matter (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Neutrophils have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in MS patients during relapse, at an early disease stage, with correlation between the CSF neutrophils and IL-17A levels (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Pediatric MS patients have neutrophils in the CSF (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), and interestingly, in adults, the neutrophils in the CSF tend to decrease with disease duration (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), both supporting a role for neutrophils locally in early disease. The detrimental role of neutrophils is also documented in 2 MS-related conditions: the neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and the MOG Ab-associated disease (MOGAD). In both diseases, activation of neutrophils occurs in blood circulation, and the production of NETs into inflamed neural tissue is observed in brain from patients (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In rodent EAE, neutrophil numbers are expanded in the periphery and in the CNS before and during the onset of symptoms (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Depletion of neutrophils (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), inhibition of neutrophil migration by blocking of the neutrophil chemokine receptor CXCR2 (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), and depletion of neutrophil attracting cytokines such as IL-17 (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) and GM-CSF (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) ameliorated the onset and severity of EAE.</p><p>The deleterious role of neutrophils in autoimmunity is mostly mediated by their production of NETs. Upon infection, neutrophils release chromatin material and granule content, including AMPs, to form net-like structures known as NETs (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). However, abnormal formation of NETs in sterile context contributes to many autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody&#x02013;associated (ANCA-associated) vasculitis, Sjogren&#x02019;s syndrome (SjS), psoriasis, and type 1 diabetes (T1D) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Cathelicidin:nucleic acid complexes in NETs induce inflammatory cytokine production by myeloid immune cells, promoting autoimmune responses (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Human cathelicidin (LL-37) functions as a cargo vehicle to transport extracellular nucleic acids into cells through membrane perturbation, permitting recognition by intracellular recognition systems within the endosome and cytosol such as TLR3, -7, -8, -9 and the cGAS/STING pathway (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). cGAS has been identified as a sensor of NETs in myeloid immune cells, mediating their activation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Here, we show that NET-associated CRAMP activates the cGAS/STING pathway in DCs stimulating the secretion of IL-6. It is noteworthy that in vitro, mouse CRAMP and human LL-37 cathelicidin showed ability to bind nucleic acids (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Mouse CRAMP:nucleic acid complexes can stimulate plasmacytoid DC activation and type I IFN production in the context of skin injury (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), atherosclerosis (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), and autoimmune diabetes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Human LL-37:nucleic acid complexes can activate the cGAS/STING pathway in both human THP1 monocyte cells and murine RAW264.7 cells (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). This observation supports that the mechanism described in the mouse EAE model may be relevant to human MS. It has also been demonstrated that cathelicidin from NETs enhances Th17 cell differentiation in dLNs through a direct effect on T cells, contributing to the development of EAE (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Together, these data support the contribution of CRAMP from NETting neutrophils to EAE, both locally and in the periphery via the promotion of the Th17 response.</p><p>Our study also shows that CNS-resident cells, including neurons, express CRAMP, which dampens inflammatory cytokine expression by microglia and astrocytes to control disease severity. The immunoregulatory ability of cathelicidin has been largely documented in various contexts with several studies that have demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice exhibit a more severe inflammatory phenotype compared with WT mice (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Cathelicidin and other AMPs modulate the immune response through multiple pathways including interference with TLR signaling, suppression of inflammatory cytokines, or induction of regulatory cytokines (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). In an autoimmune context, cathelicidin from nonimmune cells showed protective effects against RA and T1D through its ability to inhibit locally the expression of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). In the CNS, at steady state, <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice showed an increased basal level of astrocyte activation, suggesting a role for brain-borne CRAMP in maintaining immune homeostasis (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In an infectious context, CNS bacterial infection or in vitro stimulation of glial cells by bacterial supernatants increased the expression of CRAMP by astrocytes, microglia, and meningeal cells (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). CNS bacterial infection of <italic toggle="yes">Camp</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice led to a higher degree of glial cell activation accompanied by increased inflammatory cytokine expression in the CNS (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In the same infectious model, intracerebroventricular infusion of CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> led to a decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines, while increasing the expression of the antiinflammatory enzyme HO-1 in the CNS (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). In EAE, a parasitic cathelicidin-like peptide provided disease protection by reducing the expression of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 by macrophages (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Two recent studies from the same group showed contradictory results regarding the role of cathelicidin in neuroinflammation. They showed that i.t. CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> injection (30 &#x003bc;g at day 6 and day 9 after immunization) aggravated EAE and proposed that CRAMP stimulated IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;primed microglia. It is worth noting that in this study multiple sources of CRAMP in the CNS have also been identified, including neutrophils, astrocytes, neurons, and microglia. However, the relative function of CRAMP from these different cell sources was not deciphered (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). It is important to note that the dose of CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> used in this study was at least 3 times higher than the dose we used, potentially causing direct tissue damage (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). In a subsequent study, the same group demonstrated that CRAMP was expressed by astrocytes, neurons, and microglia after in vivo LPS challenge. Intracerebroventricular CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> treatment inhibited LPS-mediated neuroinflammation, resulting in decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines. In vitro, consistent with our observations, CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> treatment inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines by LPS-primed astrocytes and microglia (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>).</p><p>Our in vitro experiments support that CRAMP<sub>1-39</sub> inhibits the activation of microglia and astrocytes through the FPR2 receptor. FPR2 is capable of recognizing a wide variety of ligands and has the ability to modulate both pro- and antiinflammatory responses in the CNS, depending on the nature of these ligands (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). FPR2 expression has been described in different brain cell types, where its expression is significantly upregulated by proinflammatory stimuli (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Activation of FPR2 with various agonists attenuates the effects of neuroinflammatory challenge by reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines by microglia (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). In line with our data, a recent study showed that treatment of primary murine microglia cells by the FPR2 agonist prevented LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation, which decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). CRAMP is known to interact with FPR2 in several cell types (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>), and our data suggest that CRAMP interaction with FPR2 suppresses inflammatory microglial activity. Taken together, our data and the literature support that the CRAMP:nucleic acid complex released by neutrophils promotes neuroinflammation via the cGAS/STING pathway, whereas the free form of CRAMP secreted by neurons controls neuroinflammation via the proresolving FPR2 expressed by microglia and astrocytes.</p><p>Finally, we show that butyrate, a microbiota-derived SCFA, promotes CRAMP expression in neurons via FFAR2/3 receptors, decreased CRAMP expression in neutrophils, and accordingly has a protective role against EAE. Butyrate and other SCFAs are a well-characterized cathelicidin inducer in various rodent and human cell types (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). There is a body of evidence demonstrating that the gut microbiota plays a role in the development of MS and EAE, with altered gut microbiota composition affecting immune function (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Certain bacterial species contribute to the disease, while others have a dampening effect. Among protective species, butyrate-producing bacteria play a central role in promoting protective Tregs against EAE (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). SCFAs, especially butyrate, promote intestinal Tregs by inhibiting histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity at the <italic toggle="yes">Foxp3</italic> locus (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Accordingly, butyrate has a protective effect against EAE with fewer Th17 cells in the CNS (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). We propose, as demonstrated by us for T1D (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), that the protective effect of butyrate against EAE is also at least mediated by the stimulation of CRAMP expression by neurons. Butyrate can have EAE-protective effects through various mechanisms. For example, butyrate treatment in aged mice has been shown to promote neurogenesis in the hippocampus (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>) and butyrate treatment in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion has been shown to reduce neuronal apoptosis in the CNS via FFAR3 expressed by neurons (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). These results provide valuable insights and suggest potential avenues for future clinical trials targeting MS. Indeed, brain uptake of butyrate and other SCFAs has previously been demonstrated in rats following injection of <sup>14</sup>C-SCFAs into the carotid artery (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>) and a significant concentration of butyrate has been reported in the human brain at steady state (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). Brain concentrations of butyrate can be increased in mice after oral administration of live <italic toggle="yes">Clostridium butyricum</italic> (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>), providing a potentially safe therapeutic strategy for MS. Butyrate is a FDA-approved drug and has demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans for treating chronic bacterial infections (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>), and several clinical trials are ongoing to test its efficacy against immune-mediated diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sex as a biological variable.</title><p>Female mice were used in this study due to their heightened susceptibility to EAE.

OT-II cells were transferred i.v. 1 day prior to immunization with 100 &#x003bc;g OVA emulsified in CFA in rear footpads. Seven days later, single-cell suspensions generated from the dLNs and OT-II cell division were analyzed by flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence staining.</title><p>The SC and cervical lymph nodes were isolated and frozen in OCT (4583, Sakura Finetek) in liquid nitrogen to be cryo-sectioned (5 &#x003bc;M). Frozen sections were air dried for 10 minutes before fixation in 4% PFA for an additional 10 minutes. Slides were permeabilized with PBS 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and blocked with commercial blocking buffer (ab64226, Abcam) for 1 hour at room temperature (RT), then primary Abs were incubated in 10% donkey serum overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Primary Abs used were as follows: CRAMP (PA-CRPL, rabbit, Innovagen), anti-Ly6G (NIMP-R14, rat, Abcam), MAP2 (AP-20, mouse, Abcam), and GFAP (ab4674, chicken, Abcam). After washing, slides were then incubated with a combination of the following secondary Abs coupled with CF dyes: donkey anti-rat (catalog 20843), donkey anti-rabbit (catalog 20966), donkey anti-chicken (catalog 20166), and donkey anti-mouse (catalog 20014) (all from Biotum). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (D1306, Molecular probes). Image acquisition was performed on SFR Necker Imaging Facility using a Zeiss Spinning disk microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary glial cell culture.</title><p>For primary microglial cell cultures, the brains of 3-day-old mice were homogenized and mechanically disrupted with a nylon mesh and filtered through a 70 &#x003bc;M cell strainer. The obtained mixed glial cells were seeded in culture flasks and grown in an incubator at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM, 10% FBS, 200 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and OPI supplement (oxalacetic acid, pyruvate, insulin; O5003, Sigma).
