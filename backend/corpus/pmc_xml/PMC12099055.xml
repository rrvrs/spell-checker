In this study, we synthesized copper sulfide nanoparticles (NPs) using sericin as a biotemplate and functionalized them with tannic acid&#x02013;Fe (TA-Fe) metal&#x02013;phenolic network coatings to create CuS-based nanoenzymes (CuS-Se@TA-Fe NPs). These NPs were integrated into a composite hydrogel formed from polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl chitosan, and borax. The hydrogen bonding between polyvinyl alcohol and carboxymethyl chitosan, combined with the borate ester bonds from borax and the electrostatic interactions with CuS-Se@TA-Fe NPs, resulted in a hydrogel with remarkable adhesion, self-healing capabilities, and shape retention (PCCuT hydrogel). Additionally, the PCCuT hydrogel demonstrated superoxide dismutase and catalase mimetic activities to eliminate excess free radicals, along with excellent photothermal conversion and antimicrobial properties due to the photothermal effect. Both in&#x000a0;vitro and in&#x000a0;vivo investigations indicated that the PCCuT hydrogel could enhance angiogenesis and promote the transformation of macrophages into the M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. Notably, in a rat model of diabetic wound infection, the hydrogel exhibited substantial wound-healing benefits. In summary, the PCCuT hydrogel holds promise for advancing the treatment of diabetic wounds complicated by infection.</p></abstract><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="ID0EQMAG4557"><funding-source>

This chronic, noncommunicable disease has emerged as a remarkable social and economic challenge. Diabetic patients often experience complications with wound healing, such as diabetic foot ulcers, primarily due to the sustained high blood glucose levels that promote apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells, thereby impairing angiogenesis [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, persistent inflammation at the wound site complicates the healing process [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Macrophages, key players in the innate immune system, are crucial for modulating the inflammatory response in diabetic wounds. The initial pro-inflammatory phase is predominantly influenced by classically activated macrophages (M1), while the later phase is characterized by alternatively activated macrophages (M2), which help to reduce inflammation and support tissue repair [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, prolonged activation of M1-type macrophages results in the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), all contributing to a heightened inflammatory response that hinders healing [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, diabetic wounds are often complicated by bacterial infections, which significantly affect their recovery and potentially lead to severe complications [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As a result, the development of multifunctional dressings that incorporate pro-angiogenic, ROS scavenging, immunomodulatory, and antimicrobial properties holds considerable promise for enhancing the treatment of diabetic wounds.</p><p>Nanoenzymes represent a unique category of mimetic enzymes that combine the properties and catalytic functions of nanomaterials [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Unlike natural enzymes, nanoenzymes offer advantages such as enhanced catalytic efficiency, stability, cost-effectiveness, and scalability, making them promising candidates for treating conditions like diabetic wounds, arthritis, and periodontitis [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For instance, nanoenzymes with superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity facilitate the conversion of superoxide anions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup>) into hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which is crucial for combating microbial infections [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Conversely, those exhibiting catalase (CAT)-like activity can decompose H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into O<sub>2</sub>, thereby reducing oxidative stress and promoting healing in diabetic wounds [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Copper sulfide (CuS), a prevalent nanoenzyme, is effective in bacterial elimination through localized H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> release during photothermal therapy, attributable to its SOD-like activity [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Additionally, the release of copper ions promotes endothelial cell migration and acts as a promoter for angiogenesis [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Tannic acid (TA), a naturally derived polyphenol from plants that is recognized for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, is Food and Drug Administration approved for various applications [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The interaction of TA with Fe(III) results in the formation of a tannic acid&#x02013;Fe (TA-Fe) metal&#x02013;phenolic network (MPN) with CAT-like properties, enabling the conversion of excess H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into O<sub>2</sub>, which alleviates hypoxic conditions at the wound site [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, TA exhibits a distinctive anti-inflammatory effect, aiding macrophage polarization and modulating the inflammatory reaction [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, we propose that TA-Fe-modified CuS can catalyze a cascade of reactions at diabetic wound sites, facilitating the healing process.</p><p>Currently, the predominant approach for managing infected wounds involves antibiotic treatment; however, the misuse of drugs can result in the appearance of resistant bacteria, which can seriously affect the effectiveness of treatment. Photothermal therapy, which has received widespread attention in recent years, represents a new type of antimicrobial treatment that does not produce drug-resistant bacteria [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Photothermal agents are able to convert near-infrared (NIR) light into heat energy, thereby causing thermal damage to bacteria and eliminating them [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. CuS has been extensively studied as an excellent photothermal agent because of its high photothermal conversion efficiency [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the traditional methods for the preparation of CuS nanoparticles (NPs) have harsh requirements on the reaction conditions, and the cumbersome process affects the performance of the nanomaterials [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In recent years, the emergence of the use of bovine serum protein as a template for the preparation of CuS NPs has suffered from high prices [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Sericin is a natural protein in silkworm cocoons with excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Sericin molecules possess a loose, disordered spatial structure, with multiple amino acid residues containing long side chains and polar hydrophilic groups on the surface of the polypeptide chains. These residues can coordinate with copper ions, thereby forming copper sulfide NPs at the nanoscale. In addition, the availability and stable physicochemical properties of sericin make it an ideal material for biomedical applications [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, we obtained CuS&#x02013;sericin (CuS-Se) NPs with high photothermal conversion, biocompatibility, and low cost by in&#x000a0;situ complexation of sericin. Then, the TA-Fe MPN was incorporated, which can be used as an active coating for photothermal antimicrobial and antioxidant agents to achieve more effective bactericidal properties.</p><p>Hydrogels are promising for medical applications because of their wet-soft nature and unique bionic properties [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For more complex diabetic wounds, hydrogel dressings need to be biocompatible and have excellent biologic properties, as well as shape adaptation and adhesion to irregular wound tissue. Therefore, we need a multifunctional hydrogel with exceptional physical properties that can also destroy bacterial infections, inhibit inflammatory responses, remove ROS, and promote angiogenesis. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a safe polymer organic substance widely used in the medical field because it has no adverse effects on the human body. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) is a derivative of chitosan with excellent biocompatibility. In addition, CMCS has excellent hemostatic properties [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. By mixing PVA, CMCS, and borax, dynamic borate ester and hydrogen bonds can be formed between them to obtain hydrogels with excellent self-healing and adhesion performance. Loading CuS-Se@TA-Fe NPs into the above hydrogels will result in multifunctional hydrogel dressings with photothermal antimicrobial, ROS scavenging, immunomodulatory, angiogenic, and hemostatic properties.</p><p>In this study, we fabricated CuS-Se NPs using sericin as a biological template and functionalized TA-Fe nanocoatings on the surface, which endowed the CuS-Se NPs with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capabilities (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Then, the CuS-Se@TA-Fe NPs were further loaded into a PVA/CMCS composite hydrogel to obtain a trauma dressing with exceptional self-healing properties as well as high adhesion to biotic and abiotic tissues (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B and C). The cytocompatibility of the composite hydrogel was estimated using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and RAW264.7 cells, indicating excellent biocompatibility. 1,1-Diphenyl-2-pyridylhydrazine (DPPH) and 2,2&#x02032;-azobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging tests demonstrated that the composite hydrogel exhibits remarkable antioxidant capacity. Scratch and tube-forming experiments proved the ability of the composite hydrogel to promote HUVEC migration and angiogenesis. In addition, the immunomodulatory capacity of the composite hydrogel was demonstrated in RAW264.7 cells. In&#x000a0;vitro antimicrobial experiments demonstrated that the composite hydrogel has excellent antimicrobial ability under NIR light irradiation. Furthermore, animal model experiments showed that the hydrogel has an important effect on promoting the healing of diabetic infected wounds (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). In summary, the composite hydrogel holds great potential for application in the treatment of diabetic infected wounds.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the synthesis of the PCCuT hydrogel and its treatment of diabetic infected wounds.

Next, to synthesize nanoscale CuS, a solution containing [Cu(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> was prepared by mixing 0.1 M CuSO<sub>4</sub> with NH<sub>3</sub>&#x000b7;H<sub>2</sub>O. This solution was then diluted with 10 ml of sericin and agitated. Subsequently, 1 ml of sodium sulfide (10 mg/ml) was added until no further color change occurred in the mixture. The obtained solution was centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 10 min, followed by 3 washes with deionized (DI) water and alcohol. The precipitate was collected and freeze-dried to obtain CuS-Se NPs.</p><p>To synthesize CuS-Se@TA-Fe NPs, 50 mg of CuS-Se NPs was mixed with 20 ml of DI water.

Following this, a solution of FeCl<sub>3</sub>&#x000b7;6H<sub>2</sub>O (1 ml, 5.3 mg/ml) was introduced while adjusting the pH to neutral. Finally, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation for 10 min.</p><p>The morphology of the CuS-Se@TA-Fe NPs were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100, Tokyo, Japan). The composition and elemental distribution were measured using an x-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detector.

The samples were subjected to spectral analysis using an ultraviolet&#x02013;visible (UV&#x02013;vis) spectrophotometer (TU-1810, Shanghai, China), recording the UV&#x02013;vis&#x02013;NIR spectra. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of sericin, copper sulfide, CuS-Se, and CuS-Se@TA-Fe NPs were obtained utilizing an FTIR spectrometer (WQF-530, China).</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Fabrication and characterization of PCCuT</title><p>PVA (3 g) and CMCS (0.75 g) were solubilized in 30 ml of DI water at a temperature of 90 &#x000b0;C. After that, 300 mg of NPs was added and dispersed using ultrasound for 10 min. After that, 5 ml of 0.01 mM borax solution was added and mixed to obtain a composite hydrogel. The hydrogels were named PCCu or PCCuT, depending on whether CuS-Se NPs or CuS-Se@TA-Fe NPs were added, respectively. PC hydrogel was also prepared using the same method except without adding NPs. An EDS detector was employed to measure the composition and elemental distribution.

The EDS elemental mapping shows that the elements in the PCCuT hydrogel are evenly distributed throughout the hydrogel network, with no significant aggregation observed (Fig. <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S4</xref>).

The experiments described above likewise demonstrated the shape plasticity of hydrogels, which have important potential for coping with irregular wounds. In addition, to further demonstrate the self-healing ability of the hydrogels, 4 segments of the stained hydrogels were put together and the morphology of the joining surfaces was monitored by microscope (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E). After 30 s, the length of the hydrogel became twice as long as the original and still did not break. The connecting line between the yellow and blue hydrogels was blurred under the microscope, demonstrating its self-healing property from a new angle.

Additionally, adhesion tests were further performed using rat heart, liver, kidney, spleen, and muscle, and the PCCuT hydrogel similarly showed good adhesion properties to biological tissues (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F).

With the incorporation of NPs, the tensile strength of the PCCuT hydrogel was enhanced (0.46 MPa), accompanied by a higher Young&#x02019;s modulus (4,667 kPa). This improvement may be attributed to the strengthening of the hydrogel network&#x02019;s cross-linking due to the presence of TA [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>To evaluate the stability of the hydrogel cross-linked network, swelling and degradation experiments were performed. The composite hydrogels were soaked in PBS buffer at 37 &#x000b0;C to assess their swelling ratio (Fig. <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S7</xref>). After the addition of NPs, the maximum swelling ratio of the PCCuT hydrogel slightly decreased. This reduction is attributed to the increase in solid content, and the presence of TA led to tighter cross-linking, leaving less space for water storage.

The PCCu + NIR group still demonstrated a significant wound-healing effect, which may be attributed to the copper ions released, promoting angiogenesis.

In contrast, the PCCuT + NIR treatment further addressed oxidative stress, promoted M2 macrophage polarization, and facilitated effective wound healing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec33"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, CuS-Se NPs were synthesized for the first time, and CuS-Se@TA-Fe NPs were obtained by functionalizing TA-Fe MPN on their surfaces. CuS-Se@TA-Fe NPs were further loaded into PVA/CMCS hydrogel to obtain a composite hydrogel (PCCuT). The PCCuT hydrogel demonstrates excellent self-healing and adhesion properties. Furthermore, the PCCuT composite hydrogel exhibits nanoenzymatic effects similar to those of SOD and CAT, which are capable of scavenging excessive reactive ROS and generating oxygen. In addition, the PCCuT composite hydrogel has a significant photothermal effect, which can effectively eliminate bacteria in the wound. Experiments conducted both in&#x000a0;vitro and in&#x000a0;vivo provided evidence that the composite hydrogel had notably decreased the expression levels of inflammatory factors, promoted angiogenesis, facilitated the polarization of M2-type macrophages, and effectively promoted the healing of diabetic infected wounds. Collectively, the PCCuT hydrogel is a promising wound dressing for the treatment of diabetic infected wounds.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was funded by the Special Project for Local Science and Technology Development Guided by the Central Government of Sichuan Province (2024ZYD0058), the Luzhou Science and Technology Program (2023JYJ030, 2023WGR169, and 2024RCX210), the Sichuan Medical Association Program (2024TG03), the Scientific Research Foundation of Southwest Medical University (2023ZD002), the Project of Stomatological Institute of Southwest Medical University (2021XJYJS01), the Scientific Research Foundation of the Affiliated Stomatological Hospital of Southwest Medical University (2023BS01, 2020QY02, and 2020QY06), and the cooperative project between Xuzhou District People&#x02019;s Government and Southwest Medical University (2021XZXNYD02).
