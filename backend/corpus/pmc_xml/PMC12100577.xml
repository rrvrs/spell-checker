Access to palliative care services and awareness among the public and healthcare professionals remain low. While recognised as important in high income settings, the literature on palliative care for non-malignant disease is relatively uncommon in low- and middle-income countries, and none considered the multicultural setting of Malaysia. We aimed to explore the views and experiences of patients, healthcare providers (HCPs) and policymakers about their experience of very severe COPD and palliative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We undertook in-depth qualitative interviews with patients with very severe COPD, HCPs working in respiratory, palliative care, and primary care medicine, and health policymakers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Interviews followed a topic guide, were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using a thematic analysis approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We conducted 22 in-depth interviews with patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11), and physicians working in respiratory (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4), palliative care (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) and primary care (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) medicine. Four main themes emerged. First, there was poor understanding regarding severe, potentially life-limiting COPD and the need for palliative care. Second, patients were suffering from the severe physical, emotional, and psychosocial impact of the disease. Third, there was a lack of accessible, compassionate, holistic, and coordinated care. Finally, cultural issues such as religious norms, spirituality, community, and power hierarchies influenced patient care and acceptance of their condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The Malaysian healthcare system is responding poorly to the needs of patients with very severe COPD. Raising awareness of these needs is the first step, but there needs to be a major change within the system if the care of this hidden neglected population is to be improved.</p></sec></abstract><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="42"/><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death globally [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While medical treatments can reduce the symptom burden of this illness and quitting smoking can reduce progression, decline is inevitable and premature death is common [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Supportive and palliative care for those with severe life-threatening diseases to alleviate suffering is recognised to be a basic human right. Yet globally, many patients die without receiving such care [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Gore and colleagues [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] showed that patients with severe COPD had significantly worse quality of life than patients with lung cancer and none had received specialist palliative care. The &#x02018;transition&#x02019; to end-of-life care is unclear for patients with COPD who experience a very prolonged &#x02018;chaotic&#x02019; disease journey without the &#x02018;public story&#x02019; of cancer patients. One effect of this long-trajectory but inexorable decline is that patients and their families adapt to the substantial and increasing disability. Needs are often not expressed and help is not requested [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Although the need for supportive end-of-life non-cancer care has received attention in high-income countries [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], this is not the case in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although they bear the highest burden of NCDs, research from these contexts is severely limited [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In Malaysia, an estimated 100&#x02009;000 patients per year would benefit from palliative care [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but currently only 10% have access to services, 90% of whom are cancer patients [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Research is required to raise awareness; direct policy making and strengthen health systems. Malaysian healthcare services face the challenge of reconfiguring their services to meet the needs of the increasing number of people in the terminal phases of organ failure &#x02013; and specifically, COPD [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is unclear, however, whether this care should be the remit of specialist palliative care services, primary care services, or specialist pulmonologists. A key characteristic of Malaysian society is that it is multicultural; here we addressed this important gap in the existing body of knowledge by examining the unique interplay of cultural, structural, and systemic factors influencing COPD care in Malaysia.</p><p>We aimed to explore the views and healthcare experiences of the relevant stakeholders &#x02013; namely patients with very severe COPD, physicians, and policymakers &#x02013; regarding the disease experience and provision (or lack thereof) of supportive and palliative care for these patients and to inform the development of culturally-tailored, equitable, and actionable strategies to improve palliative care services for this underserved group.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>We conducted this qualitative study over 18 months in 2019&#x02013;20. The interviews were conducted based on this topic guide [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] (Appendix A in the <xref rid="S1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Online Supplementary Document</bold></xref>), which helped keep them structured.</p><sec><title>Recruitment</title><sec><title>Patient participants' eligibility criteria</title><p>We asked respiratory, palliative, and primary care physicians to identify people with COPD with poor prognosis in need of supportive and palliative care using:</p><list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p>Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Diseases (GOLD) severity staging that is very severe airflow limitation (forced expiratory volume (FEV<sub>1</sub>) less than 30% predicted) [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>];</p></list-item><list-item><p>Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators (SPICT) Tool [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>];</p></list-item><list-item><p>The surprise question &#x02018;Would you be surprised if your patient were to die in the next 12 months?&#x02019; [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This question is used as part of the UK Gold Standard Framework that supports early identification of patients nearing the end of life [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although the accuracy of the surprise question as a prognostic tool varies widely [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], it is still useful in this study as patients who answered &#x02018;No&#x02019; are likely to need palliative care services.</p></list-item></list><p>The exclusion criteria were the inability to participate (for example, impaired cognition due to dementia) or the presence of concomitant life-threatening illness (for example, lung cancer which would have influenced their access to palliative care services). Patients identified by their treating physicians were assessed by clinical academics on the research team. There were no exclusions following referral. We purposively sampled participants based on age, sex, ethnicity, and recruitment setting to obtain a range of perspectives [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We gave participants at least three days to consider before taking their informed consent, after which we arranged one-to-one interviews at their home or other preferred venue. Where patients preferred to be interviewed in the presence of their carer, we noted down any relevant remarks made by the carer.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility criteria for healthcare provider participants</title><p>We recruited respiratory, palliative, and primary care healthcare providers (HCPs) in the Klang Valley, Malaysia regarding their views on this topic. We interviewed professionals who headed their unit and were policymakers in the hospitals, primary care division, palliative care division, and the Malaysian Ministry of Health. We arranged the interviews at the health service institution, workplace, or other convenient venue according to their preference.</p><p>We achieved data saturation [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] by the 10th interview for the patients and the ninth interview for the physicians. The interviews were conducted in the participant&#x02019;s preferred language (English, Malay, Mandarin, or Tamil).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Experienced qualitative researchers (SML, SAM, ZNL) conducted the interviews, which lasted for up to an hour and audio-recorded them with the participants&#x02019; consent. YLC took field notes during the interview. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim by a transcriber who removed identifiers and used study codes to preserve anonymity. Transcripts in Malay, Mandarin or Tamil were then translated into English for coding and analysis. Research assistants who were fluent in the languages used during the interview carried out the translation and transcribing which was then checked by the researcher who conducted the interview. No repeat interviews were conducted.</p><p>We adapted an interview guide from similar work [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and developed it further for use with a list of open-ended questions covering broad themes (Appendices A and B in the <xref rid="S1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Online Supplementary Document</bold></xref>). We asked patient participants about their experience of living with COPD, their main physical, psychological, social, and spiritual concerns, views on the care and treatment they received from the healthcare system and society, and experiences of interactions with healthcare practitioners and the community. Issues covered with the physicians and policymakers included their experiences of looking after people with very severe COPD and their concerns (if any) with regard to current resource management [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (Appendix B in the <xref rid="S1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Online Supplementary Document</bold></xref>). We also sought their views regarding barriers to care provision, and how services could be improved.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>We organised, managed, and coded the interview data using NVivo, version 10 (QSR International, Burlington, Massachusetts, USA) and analysed it using thematic approach, guided by established qualitative frameworks [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Researchers working in pairs (SML and YLC; SAM and CYL; ZNL and YLC) independently performed the coding, resolving discrepancies by discussion. They generated the initial codes inductively, capturing key features of the data relevant to the research questions. They then organised them into broader categories and developed overarching themes collaboratively through iterative discussions. Afterwards, they created a written and graphical summary of the issues for each code using the One Sheet of Paper method [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], visually mapping the relationships between codes and themes, thus aiding in the refinement of themes and sub-themes. The multidisciplinary research team held regular review sessions to evaluate the coding framework and emerging themes to address potential biases in data interpretation.</p><p>We integrated reflexivity into the process, with researchers maintaining reflective journals to document their assumptions, potential biases, and the rationale behind analytical decisions. Finally, we shared the results with participants for member-checking to validate the findings and ensure that the interpretations accurately reflected their views.</p><sec><title>Reflexivity</title><p>SML (female, academic primary care physician), SAM (female, primary care and palliative care physician), ZNL (female, palliative care physician) and YLC (female, research assistant) analysed the data. SML, SAM, and ZNL have experience with qualitative research and are interested in developing better support systems for end-of-life non-cancer care. YLC attended a qualitative research workshop, but had no prior experience with conducting qualitative research.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Ethics and sponsorship approval</title><p>We obtained ethical approval from the Malaysian Medical Research and Ethics Committee (NMRR ID: NMRR-18-2203-40282), University of Malaya Medical Centre Medical Ethics Committee (20171227-5887), and Hospis Ethics Committee (18/01). The Academic and Clinical Central Office for Research and Development, University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom (AC18003) sponsored the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>We conducted in-depth interviews with 11 patients (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>) and 11 physicians (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>), respiratory care physicians (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4), palliative care physicians (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4), and primary care physicians (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. All patients who were approached agreed to participate. They were of different ethnicities, <italic>i.e.</italic> Malay, Chinese, Indian, and Eurasian, and were recruited from primary care clinics, palliative care clinics, respiratory clinics, and wards. Diversity in terms of age and gender was limited, as most patients with severe COPD were older and male. All patients except for one were from the B40 income group, representing the bottom 40% of income earners in Malaysia. There were two HCPs who did not answer the invitation, but of those who did, all consented for recruitment. Of the physicians, six were heads of units and policymakers in their fields.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patient participants&#x02019; sociodemographic

First, there was poor awareness and understanding regarding severe COPD and palliative care. Second, patients were suffering with severe physical, emotional, and psychosocial impacts of the disease. Third, there was lack of accessibility, compassionate, holistic, and coordinated care, except for efforts by a small core group. Finally, cultural issues such as religious norms, spirituality, community, and power hierarchies impacted on patient care and acceptance. We discuss this below, with supporting quotes.</p><sec><title>Poor awareness and understanding regarding severe COPD and palliative care</title><p>There was poor awareness and understanding of COPD, compounded by difficulty in terminology and limited health literacy of the population. There is no Malay equivalent for the term &#x02018;COPD&#x02019;: patients and physicians often labelled it as &#x02018;asthma&#x02019;, leading to further misunderstanding and delay in appropriate management.</p><disp-quote><p>I don&#x02019;t know about COPD, I don&#x02019;t know anything about the full name of COPD, but I know COPD.

There was little communication between patients and physicians and within the healthcare team, leading to uncoordinated care.</p><disp-quote><p>[ANONYMISED] hospital never the same doctor.

There was zero communication between people dealing with the same cases here. &#x02013; <italic>HCP 4, primary care physician.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>There were efforts to address these issues by a core group of dedicated health professionals who talked about setting up liaison palliative clinics with respiratory physicians, the inclusion of organ failure into eligibility for palliative services, and the training of doctors. Many of these initiatives were at an early stage, constrained by limitations in resources such as trained personnel, time, and budget.</p><disp-quote><p>We have accepted non-cancer patients from day one and after 25 years, the proportion of non-cancer still remains at 10%, despite non-cancer being seen as the single biggest area of need. <italic>&#x02013; HCP 4, primary care physician working at a hospice.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>One respiratory physician who disagreed with this theme felt that patients were fortunate to get high quality care at low cost. However, he stated that patients with poor prognosis would be discharged to primary care but rarely get referred to palliative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Cultural issues and power hierarchies impacted on patient care and acceptance</title><p>Many participants described how cultural issues such as religious norms and spirituality affected patient care and acceptance of their condition. For example, <italic>redha </italic>(acceptance), an important part of the Islamic religion, was perceived by Muslims to be an expression of their contentment with God&#x02019;s will. Fate was also important for patients of other faiths: some non-Muslim participants attributed their illness to karma or spiritual imbalance, affecting their approach to healthcare decisions.</p><disp-quote><p>As Malay Muslim, I have to accept whatever that comes my way.

That&#x02019;s all. &#x02013; <italic>P10 (Muslim), male, 70s.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>From the physicians&#x02019; perspective, the acceptance of their condition as fate, led to some patients refusing treatment. This was challenging for HCPs who felt that they could help ease suffering.</p><disp-quote><p>They go to the ultimate power. &#x02018;God says I have to suffer. Okay, I am fated to be like this. It&#x02019;s a test of my will. Alright&#x02019; &#x02018;I have some morphine that will override what God wishes (&#x02026;) you want it?&#x02019; (&#x02026;) &#x02018;No cannot, cannot override God&#x02019;. It&#x02019;s, it&#x02019;s, I find it quite challenging sometimes, where you potentially have erm therapies that may help. But they feel that they don&#x02019;t want it, that this is a test. &#x02013; <italic>HCP 4, primary care physician.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>Many of the participants spoke of family involvement in decision making.

This suffering remains hidden from view to all except to the patients and their carers, compounded by a lack of awareness and understanding &#x02013; or even a name &#x02013; for COPD and palliative care, both by the public and the healthcare personnel. This results in an inadequate response from the healthcare system and a lack of accessible, coordinated, compassionate and holistic care. There are also social and cultural factors that play important roles in the care and acceptance of the diagnosis in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation in relation to existing literature</title><p>Patients in this study showed poor understanding regarding COPD and palliative care. Most came from the B40 income group, highlighting the compounded challenges faced by socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. The poor understanding may be due to poor health literacy, where difficult terminology and complex causes lead to patients and their physicians resorting to the use of the word &#x02018;asthma&#x02019; to describe COPD. This confusion in terminology was observed in a study conducted in Malaysia 10 years ago [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A study conducted in India showed that only 58% of physicians used the correct terminology for COPD, with a fifth of the patients with COPD identified their disease as being asthma [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In contrast, a study conducted in the Netherlands showed that 70% of patients with COPD could name their disease correctly [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It may also reflect the challenges of differentiating COPD and asthma in a primary care setting without access to spirometry. A study conducted in Scotland and Colorado showed that of participants who had a spirometry-based diagnosis of COPD made during the study, 52% reported a prior diagnosis of asthma [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>There was poor understanding of the potential benefits of palliative care in this group of patients with very severe COPD. There appears to be more attention and palliative care resources provided for cancer patients [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Some hospices in Malaysia do not accept patients with a diagnosis other than cancer [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In Malaysia and many LMICs, chronic respiratory diseases are not considered to be a top priority for research or clinical focus, often being conspicuous by their absence in national reports [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This lack of prioritisation is likely to be a key component contributing to the suffering of patients with COPD at the end of their life and the poor response of our healthcare system.</p><p>COPD affected all aspects of patients&#x02019; and their carers&#x02019; lives, causing severe physical, emotional and psychosocial suffering. It is ironic that &#x02018;palliative care that aims to provide relief from the symptoms and stress of a serious illness (ideally from a relatively early stage in the disease [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]) was often misunderstood by our participants as &#x02018;giving up on the patient&#x02019; [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This lack of understanding is not dissimilar to those in other LMICs [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for policy and practice</title><p>The Malaysian government has presented a new vision of healthcare transformation where one of the four key priorities is to move from disease-centred care to patient-centred care [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the physicians in this study had no clear perception of their own role, leading to poor coordination. COPD patients with severe disease frequently seek hospitalisation, creating tension in an already strained healthcare system. A small group of healthcare personnel were trying to effect change and provide palliative care to these patients. However, system change is required to support these efforts. This is similar to challenges in the provision of palliative care for lung diseases in low-resource settings, where this provision is likely to be non-existent or minimal, and further coupled with low access to health services and social and cultural beliefs around palliative care [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Future strategies will have to consider the sociocultural issues relevant to the local context. Belief in fate and God may result in negative or positive influences on self-care practices and coping mechanisms, as described by our participants. This agrees with a study looking at self-care practices and support of Malaysian patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The concept of <italic>redha</italic> (acceptance of fate) among Muslim patients, for example, underscores how religious acceptance can influence health-seeking behaviour, with some patients perceiving medical intervention as conflicting with their spiritual beliefs. This aligns with studies which have shown that religious fatalism can act as both a coping mechanism and a barrier to timely healthcare access [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The emphasis on family decision-making and lack of patient involvement in their care reflects traditional Asian cultural values, where collective responsibility often takes precedence over individual autonomy [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. While this can foster support for the patient, it may also result in delays or conflicts when family members hold differing views on treatment options. Promoting shared decision-making practices may be an option. These findings underscore the need for culturally tailored healthcare practices/interventions that respect patients' beliefs while facilitating informed decision-making to improve the response of the healthcare system to the needs of these patients.</p><p>Power hierarchies were also seen to influence patient care, highlighting the role reversal and disempowerment that occur when people present as a patient in the healthcare system. The situation is exacerbated by the higher prevalence of COPD in the lower socioeconomic population [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], leaving them even more at risk of poor-quality healthcare and limited accessibility [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>A global group of clinicians and representatives of patient support groups have developed a COPD patient charter that comprises six principles of quality care that patients should expect to receive [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These include timely access to diagnosis, assessment, and personalised treatment, with maximisation of quality of life without stigma or guilt. These principles directly address the issues highlighted by our study.</p><p>Hence, we need systemic change in Malaysia, including provision or enhancing palliative care services where it is non-existent or lacking in healthcare; developing and implementing cultural sensitive targeted education to bridge knowledge gaps among healthcare providers and patients on COPD and palliative care; and the importance of timely referrals to palliative care. In addition to investing in the infrastructure within LMICs, we need to conduct more research to address the inequities for the disadvantaged population, as highlighted by the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (Lung Diseases Group) [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Our study offers major new insights into the need for palliative care for chronic non-cancer diseases (specifically, COPD) in a LMIC in Southeast Asia. The participants were representative of patients with severe COPD who are mainly cared for by a small group of specialised HCPs in the public health system. The results of this study cannot be generalised to affluent patients, who are likely to seek care from private healthcare facilities nor patients in different cultural or healthcare settings. Further, Malaysia is a multicultural middle-income country in Asia, so our findings will provide insights to LMICs of similar settings or cultural background. Moreover, the exclusion of participants with impaired cognition or other life-limiting disease may have led to selection biases rendering them applicable to a specific subset of COPD patients but was necessary to allow for data collection. This ensured results were not confounded by other life-limiting conditions (such as cancer) that already attracted palliative care. There was a differing viewpoint by one of the physician participants on the third theme (lack of accessible, compassionate, holistic, and coordinated care). This may indicate that data saturation was not achieved for HCPs. However, there was triangulation between the patient and doctor transcripts, which supported validity of our findings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>There needs to be major change within the Malaysian healthcare system to meet the needs of patients with severe, life-limiting COPD. This will be a complex and challenging task, which should start by creating increased awareness of this hidden neglected population amongst communities, physicians, and policymakers. We need to understand the extent of the problem, ensuring an equitable and ethical strategy that can put in place an accessible, coordinated and holistic approach to address the existing gaps highlighted in this paper.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional material</title><supplementary-material id="S1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>
