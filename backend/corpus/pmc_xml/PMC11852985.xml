In young rodents, knockdown of PTEN, which antagonizes PI3K signaling by hydrolyzing PIP3, promotes axon regeneration following SCI. However, this effect diminishes in adults, potentially due to lower PI3K activation leading to reduced PIP3. This study explores whether increased PIP3 generation can promote long-distance regeneration in adults. We used a hyperactive PI3K, PI3K&#x003b4; (PIK3CD), to boost PIP3 levels in mature cortical neurons and assessed CST regeneration after SCI. Adult rats received AAV1-PIK3CD and AAV1-eGFP, or AAV1-eGFP alone, in the sensorimotor cortex concurrent with a C4 dorsal SCI. Transduced neurons showed increased pS6 levels, indicating elevated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. CST regeneration, confirmed with retrograde tracing, was evaluated up to 16&#x000a0;weeks post injury. At 12&#x000a0;weeks, &#x0223c;100 axons were present at lesion sites, doubling to 200 by 16&#x000a0;weeks, with regeneration indices of 0.1 and 0.2, respectively. Behavioral tests showed significant improvements in paw reaching, grip strength, and ladder-rung walking in PIK3CD-treated rats, corroborated by electrophysiological recordings of cord dorsum potentials and distal flexor muscle electromyography. Thus, PI3K&#x003b4; upregulation in adult cortical neurons enhances axonal regeneration and functional recovery post SCI.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0020"><p>The study identifies a treatment that enables extensive regeneration of motor axons after spinal cord injury.

The intrinsic ability of axons in the brain and spinal cord to regenerate diminishes as neurons mature. There are several mechanisms behind this loss of regenerative ability, notably: (1) reduction in signaling, particularly in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, known to be crucial in promoting growth; (2) development of neuronal polarity, leading to polarized transport that excludes many growth-related molecules from axons,&#x000a0;limiting their regenerative potential; and (3) genetic/epigenetic changes in maturing neurons that affect expression of axon-growth-related molecules.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><p id="p0015">A key signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and motility<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> is initiated by PI3K activity, which generates the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). The levels of PIP3 are tightly controlled and localized by regulating the activity of PI3K, as well as the phosphatases PTEN and SHIP, which dephosphorylate PIP3.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The involvement of PIP3 in axon regeneration has been shown through knockout of PTEN, enabling spinal cord axon regeneration in young animals.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> However, in adult animals PTEN depletion has much less effect on regeneration.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The aim of this study was to develop a PIP3-related intervention that is effective in adult mammals.

Lengths of layer V cortical neurons were measured in mCherry<sup>+</sup> retrogradely labeled intact projecting neurons (B). AAV1-SYN-PIK3CD-treated neurons expressed high levels of PI3K&#x003b4; only after treatment (C), since endogenous cortical levels were low (D). Soma lengths were also measured in GFP controls (E). At both 12 and 16&#x000a0;weeks after SCI (F), soma lengths of neurons in control groups were smaller than those overexpressing both mCherry or PI3K&#x003b4; (Fa), while no statistical difference was found between PI3K&#x003b4; neurons and mCherry<sup>+</sup> neurons (Fb) Data shown as individual values.

A full experiment was therefore performed, using dorsal column lesions extending through the CST down to the spinal canal with viral vectors injected into the sensorimotor cortex area projecting to the cervical spinal cord where SCI was induced. For the full follow-up experiments with behavior or electrophysiology recordings, we used vectors expressing PI3K&#x003b4; under the neuron-specific SYN promoter, which had an expression level comparable with that of AAV1-CAG-PIK3CD (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures&#x000a0;S1</xref>A&#x02013;S1G). This vector was used in combination with SYN-GFP as the axon tracer.

Moreover, tagging PI3K&#x003b4; with GFP or any other tag inactivates it. AAV1 injections led to expression of PI3K&#x003b4; and GFP in neurons with a soma length of approximately 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;1</xref>C, 1Fa, and 1Fb).

In GFP controls few axons sprouted (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;4</xref>B, 4B1, and 4B2). A reconstructed lesion from an AAV1-SYN-PIK3CD-treated rat, sectioned sagittally, is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C. Regenerating axons were seen meeting the lesion and then growing around the lesion margin. At the caudal margin of the lesion, an accumulation of regenerated axons was seen as the peri-lesional axons collected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;4</xref>A3 and 4C). From this bundle, many axons were seen to grow on in the dorsal cord (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;4</xref>A3 and 4A4). These had the typical thin meandering morphology of regenerated axons. A progressively decreasing number of these axons was seen to 1&#x000a0;cm below the lesions. The number of axons at the caudal lesion margin was on average 100 at 12&#x000a0;weeks and 200 at 16&#x000a0;weeks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;4</xref>D and 4E). Comparing labeled axon numbers rostral and caudal to the lesions the regeneration indices were 0.1 and 0.2, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>F). A complication in quantifying regeneration in dorsal column lesions is that the ventral CST (vCST) is not cut, and the axons of this pathway may sprout after injury. It is easy to distinguish the unlesioned axons because they are straight with a large diameter compared to regenerates (annotated with red arrows in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A). However, the sprouts are difficult to distinguish from those of regenerated axons. This is illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C, where sprouted ventral axons are shown in red. The position of regenerated CST axons in the dorsal cord and their continuity with the knot of axons at the caudal end of the lesion makes it easy to identify regenerates for 0.5&#x000a0;cm caudal to the lesion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A3). For a further 0.5&#x000a0;cm, a steadily decreasing number of labeled axons with the morphology of regenerates in the same position was observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A4). We identified these as regenerated CST axons, although with lower confidence than for the more rostral 0.5&#x000a0;cm.

Additionally, the growth pattern in rats treated with AAV1-CAG-PIK3CD that were sectioned frontally was observed, and axons also had the tendency to bypass the lesion laterally at 9 and 12&#x000a0;weeks after injury, with more found at the longer time point (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;4</xref>Gii and 4Giii).<fig id="fig4"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Axon count analysis,growth pattern reconstruction, and retrograde tracing</p><p>Axon count below lesion was evaluated in every other 20-&#x003bc;m spinal cord sagittal section in treated (A)&#x000a0;and control (B)&#x000a0;animals.

In general, axons followed the edge of the lesions ventrally and laterally, usually within 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m. Having passed around the lesion cavities, they collected at their caudal edge, where many fine axons with the typical fine meandering anatomy of regenerated axons were found randomly oriented. From here, most of the axons grew in a more directed fashion in a caudal direction where a band of axons was seen within approximately 0.25&#x000a0;mm from the dorsal surface, their numbers steadily diminishing with distance from the lesion. Axons grew around the whole extent of lesions, and therefore axons caudal to the lesion were in both sides of the cord. Axons were seen mainly in the contralateral DH, which reflects the lateral pathway of regeneration, but some grew around the injury and into the ipsilateral side of the cord. Our lesions were dorsal, so the vCST was not cut. Thick straight unlesioned axons were therefore seen in the ventral cord when sectioned sagittally. Between this group of clearly unlesioned axons and the clearly regenerated axons there is a region of gray matter containing many fine processes, which could be branches from the regenerated axons or the unlesioned vCST; neurites in this region were not counted when they were seen to emerge from the vCST.

These responses displayed a normal pattern in which the higher the stimulation current amplitude, the higher was the elicited electrical potential. After PI3K&#x003b4; treatment, we measured increased potential in the distal front limb flexor muscles, suggesting increased innervation, while control rats showed minimal response to stimulation. We then studied expression of the neuronal activity marker cFOS in the spinal neurons.

When staining for PI3K&#x003b4;, a heat-induced antigen retrieval (HIER) step was incorporated into the protocol. Sections were washed once in dH<sub>2</sub>O and transferred into a 4.5&#x000a0;mM aqueous solution of citraconic anhydride. Plates containing the samples were placed in a water bath and warmed to 98&#x000b0;C for 20&#x000a0;min. Samples were then left to cool completely before washing once in dH<sub>2</sub>O and twice in TBS before continuing with standard protocols. Work with the HIER agent was performed under a fume hood.

Differences in the number of axons in VHs and DHs were also observed, and all values were normalized to the MFI of the dCST (average from three images per rat) and area of DHs/VHs.

A grid with 60-&#x003bc;m spacing placed in a microscope eyepiece allowed us to determine the distance below the lesion. A count of axons every 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m was determined using an Axioskop 2 plus microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). At each 60-&#x003bc;m increment, the number of axons crossing a line was noted. Axons appearing to be part of the vCST, which are not destroyed in this model, were not counted. Axons clearly sprouting from the vCST were also not included. For plotting reasons, sums of axons of every 600-&#x003bc;m increment were used, which were a product of a sum of all sections counted that corresponded to the same caudal distance from the lesion. A regeneration index was then calculated as the number of counted axons normalized to the mean number of axons in the dCST counted in three cross-sections above the lesion. A paired t test was used to calculate significant differences between groups. A reconstruction of regenerated spinal cord was produced by approximate drawing of GFP<sup>+</sup> axons and neurites. Blue color was assigned to those found cranially to lesion and extending, red color was assigned to axons and neurites in the ventral part of sections, and green color represented neurites residing in the dorsal half of the cord caudal to the lesion border (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.7.6"><title>Qualitative analysis of synapses below the lesion site</title><p id="p0250">Spinal cross-sections from animals 16&#x000a0;weeks after treatment and stained for neuronal marker NeuN (Alexa 647), regenerated axon marker GFP, presynaptic vGlut1/2, and postsynaptic Homer1 were imaged at 40&#x000d7; and 63&#x000d7; oil-immersion magnification using an Olympus SpinSR10 confocal microscope.
