Regular moderate-intensity exercise can direct the immune response toward an anti-inflammatory state, which is beneficial for improving the health and exercise tolerance. In cardiac rehabilitation, attention to the management of inflammatory factors as well as the improvement of exercise endurance is beneficial for the rehabilitation of elderly patients with coronary artery disease. This study investigates the impact of tiered cardiac rehabilitation programs on levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), and the capacity for physical exertion in older CHD patients. From March 2020 to April 2022, 94 elderly patients with CHD visiting our institution were recruited and randomly allocated into either a control group or an observation group, each comprising 47 participants. The standard care group participated in traditional rehabilitation exercises, whereas the experimental group received customized, tiered, cardiac rehabilitation interventions. We assessed the variations in CRP and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) levels, along with exercise capacity, before and after treatment in both groups. The result shows that significant reductions in CRP and TNF-&#x003b1; levels were seen in the experimental group after 4 and 12 weeks, compared to the standard care group. Analysis showed clear trends in CRP and TNF-&#x003b1; changes over the interventions, with the experimental group showing better results. CRP levels decreased consistently, while TNF-&#x003b1; levels stayed stable. The experimental group also showed improvements in physical endurance measures compared to the control group. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and fibrinogen (Fib) in the observation group decreased compared with the control group (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). After 12 weeks of treatment, CRP and TNF-&#x003b1; showed significant negative correlation with exercise endurance index &#x02013; 6&#x02009;min walking test (6 MWT), anaerobic threshold (AT), maximum oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>), and exercise duration (ED); significant positive correlation between cardiac rehabilitation grade and exercise endurance index (6 MWT, AT, VO<sub>2max</sub> and ED); and both groups experienced cardiovascular adverse events and exercise muscle injury. The analysis shows that the graded nursing of cardiac rehabilitation can effectively reduce the levels of CRP, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and Fib in elderly patients with CHD and significantly improve the exercise endurance of patients with good safety.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p>

In the last three decades, the age-standardized prevalence of CHD has seen a 4.6% reduction, while absolute deaths have decreased by 31% and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) have dropped by 28.6% [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These data underscore significant advancements in both the prevention and management of CHD worldwide. Nevertheless, it is vital to address the health issues that elderly CHD patients face, which are exacerbated by lifestyle shifts and an aging population [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A recent prospective chronic disease study in China links increased physical activity with lower cardiovascular mortality, suggesting that enhanced physical activity could mitigate the death risk among cardiovascular disease patients [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, boosting physical activity might be a viable approach to enhance the health of elderly CHD patients.</p><p>C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein, tends to rise during inflammation or tissue damage. For those suffering from CHD, a rise in CRP levels often indicates an inflammatory reaction to atherosclerosis. Higher levels of CRP are linked to a greater risk of cardiovascular incidents and correlate closely with their severity [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Similarly, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), a regulator of inflammation and immune responses, when overproduced in CHD patients, can heighten the inflammation and expedite atherosclerosis progression [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Elevated TNF-&#x003b1; levels are tied to heightened risks of cardiovascular events and myocardial damage [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, a decline in exercise tolerance characterizes many elderly CHD sufferers, severely impacting their quality of life (QoL). This decline is associated with measures of vascular wall stiffness [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Monitoring CRP and TNF-&#x003b1; levels along with exercise tolerance shifts is crucial for the effective diagnosis and management of CHD in older adults.</p><p>At present, intensity interval training and resistance exercises are the main rehabilitation training methods for patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation. However, this training is not suitable for the elderly population [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. High-intensity interval training is recognized as an effective modality for improving cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption [VO<sub>2</sub>]) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to improve HRQoL and hospital admissions in patients with heart failure and may reduce mortality in the long term, and these reductions appear to be consistent across patient and program characteristics [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Home-based cardiac rehabilitation had the best results in terms of functional capacity, QoL, and reduced readmission rates within 90 days [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is clear that scientifically based cardiac rehabilitation is effective in improving cardiorespiratory fitness and reducing the risk of readmission in patients with CHD, but there is a lack of targeted research on exercise tolerance and inflammatory factors. Stratified cardiac rehabilitation was first proposed by Patti et al. [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as a dynamically adjustable rehabilitation method for patients with cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, reports on its effects on inflammatory markers and exercise tolerance in elderly CHD patients are still lacking. Thus, this study aims to provide new evidence for improving the prognosis of these patients by observing the impact of stratified cardiac rehabilitation on CRP, TNF-&#x003b1;, and exercise tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="j_biol-2022-1040_s_002"><label>2</label><title>Data and methods</title><sec id="j_biol-2022-1040_s_002_s_001"><label>2.1</label><title>General data</title><p>Sample size was calculated using MACE medical software, using the superiority of the two independent samples, with the CRP level, the mean of 80 patients was 10.5 within 1 year, the mean of 8.5, 8.5, the combined standard deviation of 3.6, clinical significance difference between the two groups, 0.05, <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic> 0, power = 1 &#x02212; <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.9, a sample size ratio of 1:1, considering a 10% loss-to-visit rate, and the final sample size was 47.

For example, aspirin and clopidogrel can be used to guide patients to eat a reasonable diet and control weight.</p><p>The control group underwent standard rehabilitation therapy, which involved a structured program of power cycling, segmented into warm-up, cycling, and cooling down phases, followed by walking exercises. Specifically, the regimen included a 5-min warm-up, 20&#x02009;min of cycling, and a 5-min cool-down, culminating in 30&#x02009;min of total exercise time. Walking exercises were conducted 1-h post-cycling, with each session lasting for 20&#x02009;min, and the protocol was set for 5 days per week. The schedule was adapted based on individual patient recovery progress. Over the 12-week program, the care team diligently monitored vital signs during sessions, and key cardiovascular metrics such as blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG were routinely assessed weekly to timely identify any progression in heart conditions.</p><p>In the observation group, stratified cardiac rehabilitation was implemented on top of the control group. Initially, a stratified cardiac rehabilitation plan was developed, and multiple batches of cardiology head physicians, supervising nurses, and cardiac rehabilitation nurses were trained. The attending physician undertook the patient grading assessment, the attending nurse was responsible for screening suitable patients, and the cardiac rehabilitation nurse was responsible for assisting patients in establishing rehabilitation goals and carrying out early activity and pulmonary function rehabilitation intervention. Stratified cardiac rehabilitation was divided into seven levels. Each level was divided into two aspects: early activity program and breathing training program. Specific contents: (1) Level 1: the bleeding risk of the patient was assessed by the attending physician after admission. Passive exercises in bed, active/passive joint activities in a semi-recumbent position, or active/passive reactive bicycle in a recumbent position was performed for patients without bleeding risk for 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;min once a day. At 10 o&#x02019;clock every day, respiratory control exercises or recumbent breathing exercises were performed for 20&#x02009;min once a day for 1 week. (2) Level 2: When the level I was completed and can be carried out stably for 7 days, assessment was done to find out whether the hemodynamic indexes of patients were stable. The stabilized patients received sitting exercises and sitting breathing exercises, while the unstabilized patients continued with level 1 training and reassessed after an extension of 3 days. Sitting exercises and sitting breathing exercises, bedside sitting training, active joint activities, or sitting active/passive reactive treadmill in bed were done 1&#x02009;h/day. Sitting breathing exercises involved performing abdominal respiration in the sitting relaxed state, inhalation through the nose and exhalation through the mouth for 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;min, for 1 week. (3) Level 3: The patients were asked to stand for 2&#x02009;min after the second level. If the patient can start the third level training for 2&#x02009;min, if the independent standing time was less than 2&#x02009;min, the second level training was evaluated again after 3&#x02009;days, the main intervention method was 1&#x02009;h/day, divided into active joint activity, active power riding, lower limb strength exercises for 1 week; and standing breathing exercises were done for 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;min for 1 week. (4) Level 4: After the third stage was completed, 50&#x02009;m walking test and evaluation were carried out. If patients can normally complete the 50&#x02009;m walking test, they will start level 4 training; if the distance of 50&#x02009;m walking is less than 50&#x02009;m, they will continue level 3 training and reassessed after 3 days, and so on. Level 4 intervention was mainly based on incremental walking training and sitting Eight Pieces of Brocade (Ba Duan Jin). During each training, the time and distance of walking should be gradually increased, which can be gradually increased to 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;min/day according to individual conditions, 3&#x02013;5 times/week. The sitting Eight Pieces of Brocade (Ba Duan Jin) was performed 30&#x02009;min after the incremental walking training for 2 weeks. (5) Level 5: After the fourth level was completed, five-level training will be carried out. If the 200&#x02009;m walking distance is less than 150&#x02009;m, the fourth level of training will be continued and evaluated again after 3 days. The rest can be done in the same manner. For the fifth level, 200&#x02009;m walking training and standing breathing exercises were used as the main intervention methods. During each training, the walking time and distance should be gradually increased, which can be gradually increased to 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;min/day and 2&#x02013;3 times/day according to individual conditions, and the training included active joint movement and lower limb strength exercises. The standing breathing exercises were performed 30&#x02009;min after the 200&#x02009;m walking training for 2 weeks. (6) Level 6: After the fifth level was completed, a 500&#x02009;m walking test and evaluation shall be carried out. If the patient can normally complete the 200&#x02009;m walking test, he/she will start the fifth-level training; if the distance is shorter than 200&#x02009;m, he/she will continue the fifth-level training, and re-evaluate after 3 days, and so on. The sixth level was mainly intervened by 500&#x02009;m walking training and Taijiquan. During each training, the patient can move freely in the ward area, and the walking time and distance were gradually increased. The intervention time can be gradually increased to 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;min/day, 3&#x02013;5 times/week according to individual conditions. Taijiquan was performed 30&#x02009;min after incremental walking training for 2 weeks, and the corresponding reexamination plan was made. (7) Level 7: After the completion of level 6, a 500&#x02009;m walking test and evaluation shall be carried out again. If the patient can normally complete the 500&#x02009;m (&#x02265;370&#x02009;m) walking test, level 4 training shall be started; if the 50&#x02009;m walking distance is less than 370&#x02009;m, level 6 training shall be continued, and the assessment shall be carried out again after 3 days, and so on. Level 7 intervention methods include independent activity in the ward and standing Eight Pieces of Brocade (Ba Duan Jin). During each training, the range of activity and activity time shall be gradually increased. The intervention time can be gradually increased to 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;min/time, 2 times/day, and 3&#x02013;5 times/week according to individual conditions. The standing Eight Pieces of Brocade (Ba Duan Jin) was carried out 30&#x02009;min after spontaneous activity in the ward and continued until 12 weeks of intervention (see <xref

Previous studies link exercise tolerance with muscle functionality and oxygenation levels [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Stratified cardiac rehabilitation through staged early exercise and respiratory training boosts cardiac output, enhancing tissue oxygenation and promoting vascular regeneration, which in turn augment the aerobic capacity of the patients [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Elevated levels of CRP and TNF-&#x003b1; can impair cardiomyocytes and myocardial contractility [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The suppression of these inflammatory markers through stratified cardiac rehabilitation aids in protecting myocardial cells and overall cardiac function, thus improving exercise tolerance [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Enhanced cardiopulmonary function leads to further reduction of inflammatory markers, creating a positive feedback loop in cardiopulmonary health for these patients.</p><p>In this study, we observed that cardiac rehabilitation graded care significantly reduced CRP and TNF-&#x003b1; levels in elderly patients with CAD. These findings are not merely observational; they actually reflect the effects of cardiac rehabilitation on inflammatory markers at the cellular and molecular levels. Cardiac rehabilitation graded care works through multiple mechanisms. Exercise training, a core component of cardiac rehabilitation, has been shown to activate anti-inflammatory pathways. Exercise increases circulation, facilitates the removal of inflammatory mediators, and improves endogenous antioxidant capacity, thereby decreasing levels of inflammatory markers such as CRP and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, regular exercise further reduces the chronic inflammatory state by promoting vascular endothelial function, improving insulin resistance, and promoting lipid metabolism [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. At the molecular level, cardiac rehabilitation graded care may reduce the expression of inflammatory factors by affecting cell signaling pathways. For example, exercise reduces the activity of NF-&#x003ba;B (nuclear factor &#x003ba;B), a key transcription factor that promotes the expression of several inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&#x003b1; and CRP.</p><p>CRP and TNF-&#x003b1; are important inflammatory factors and markers of myocardial injury. Their elevated levels can damage cardiomyocytes and inhibit myocardial contractility, resulting in decreased cardiac function [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Cardiac hypofunction directly affects the body&#x02019;s exercise tolerance [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Inflammatory reactions lead to the production of a large number of muscle injury-related factors, CK (creatine kinase) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), in the body, which can also damage skeletal muscles. Muscle hypofunction will also directly lead to decreased exercise endurance [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. TNF-&#x003b1; can inhibit skeletal muscle proliferation and promote protein degradation [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This results in reduced muscle mass and decreased muscle strength, which affect exercise tolerance [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, it is speculated that stratified cardiac rehabilitation can improve exercise endurance by reducing the level of inflammatory factors, protecting myocardial and skeletal muscle cells, and improving microcirculation and oxygenation function [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Different exercise tolerance indexes reflect different aspects of aerobic exercise ability, but they are closely related to cardiopulmonary function and muscle status. It can be seen that reducing inflammation is an important way to improve exercise tolerance, and there is a complex biological internal relationship between the two. At the same time, this study further observed the improvement in ED and VO<sub>2max</sub> in observation group patients, but the placebo effect could not be completely excluded due to study restrictions. Considering that psychological expectations of patients may also have an impact on their physiological status, the improvement in exercise tolerance may still be affected by the placebo effect of patients&#x02019; own psychology and diet. But this study considered the effect of placebo effects in the statistical analysis and used appropriate methods to adjust the &#x003b1; levels to control the risk of multiple comparisons and type I errors. This will help us to more accurately assess the differences between the experimental and control groups and determine how much the observed effects can be attributed to the placebo effect.</p><p>Compared with the study of Malandish et al. [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the results of this study only focused on the elderly population with CHD and used not only exercise intervention but also more specific and comprehensive intervention population and intervention measures. At the same time, the observation indicators of this study cover CRP, TNF-&#x003b1;, and a number of exercise tolerance indicators, with a wider coverage. Compared with the results of Bhati et al. [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], this study showed that stratified cardiac rehabilitation had a more significant effect on TNF-&#x003b1;, which may be related to the fact that only elderly patients were included in this study. At the same time, this study found that resistance exercise had anti-inflammatory effects and reduced the degree of cardiac autonomic dysfunction [<xref rid="j_biol-2022-1040_ref_034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This study confirms that stratified cardiac rehabilitation can not only reduce inflammatory factors but also significantly improve the exercise tolerance of elderly patients. This finding enriches the application scope of cardiac rehabilitation care. The exercise endurance of the control group also improved, which was related to the drug treatment, lifestyle, and exercise training, but the effect was insufficient compared with the observation group. This research demonstrates that stratified cardiac rehabilitation enhances the prognosis for elderly patients with CHD, supporting the broader adoption of this rehabilitation model. The findings also offer insights into potential molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac rehabilitation, aiding future studies in detailing its effects.</p><p>Nevertheless, the limited sample size of this study, consisting of only 94 participants, raises concerns about the representativeness of the results. Future research could utilize a multi-center approach to expand the sample size and enhance the robustness of the findings. This randomized controlled trial indicates that stratified cardiac rehabilitation effectively lowers the CRP and TNF-&#x003b1; levels and boosts exercise tolerance in elderly patients with CHD, suggesting it contributes significantly to these improvements. These outcomes confirm the causal link between stratified cardiac rehabilitation and reductions in inflammatory markers as well as increased exercise tolerance. Further investigations could reinforce this causal connection by enlarging the participant pool and extending the duration of follow-up. But this study considered the effect of placebo effects in the statistical analysis and used appropriate methods to adjust the &#x003b1; levels to control the risk of multiple comparisons and type I errors. This will help us to more accurately assess the differences between the experimental and control groups and determine how much of the observed effects can be attributed to the placebo effect.</p><p>In this study, only short-term follow-up was performed, and the long-term effect needs further observation. It is suggested to set up a longer follow-up period to observe the long-term effect of graded cardiac rehabilitation care. Additionally, this study concentrated solely on four inflammatory markers, CRP, IL-6, fib, and TNF-&#x003b1;, omitting a broader analysis of the inflammatory profile. Future research should include a wider array of inflammatory markers. The current study also involved only a short-term follow-up; assessing the long-term impacts of stratified cardiac rehabilitation is necessary. A longer follow-up period is recommended for observing the sustained effects of rehabilitation. In addition, the study involved only 94 patients, which limits its statistical power and generalizability. A multicenter trial with a larger, more diverse cohort will improve the applicability of the findings to a wider population. The sample size still needs to be expanded in the future to avoid potential bias in the results.</p></sec><sec id="j_biol-2022-1040_s_005"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>The application of cardiac rehabilitation graded care in elderly patients with CHD not only significantly improves the levels of inflammatory markers and exercise tolerance but also improves the quality of survival of patients, which is an effective nursing intervention. Future studies can further explore the application effect of graded cardiac rehabilitation care in different patient groups, as well as its mechanism of action at the cellular and molecular levels, to provide more scientific basis for clinical practice. At the same time, it also provides strong evidence to support the clinical implementation of cardiac rehabilitation and suggests that cardiac rehabilitation graded care should be widely used in the treatment and rehabilitation of patients with CAD.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="j_biol-2022-1040_fn_003" fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
