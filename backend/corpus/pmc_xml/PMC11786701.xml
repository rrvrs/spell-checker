This includes oil-well drilling and gas kick scenarios. The theoretical foundation for this dataset lies in the complex interplay between gas and liquid phases in vertical flow conditions, which significantly impacts the efficiency, safety, and environmental footprint of oil extraction processes. Specifically, we aimed to provide a detailed visual and empirical basis to support research into gas kick modeling, slug flow, bubble migration time estimations, two-phase flow parameter calculations, and gas kick expansion modeling, among others. By documenting various flow regimes such as Taylor bubble, bubbly, slug, and churn flows within a controlled environment, our dataset offers a unique value to ongoing research efforts. It complements existing theoretical [<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>] and experimental [<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>] studies by providing a high-fidelity visual reference that can be used to verify models and simulations, thereby enhancing the accuracy of holdup calculations and other related parameters during two-phase flow regimes.</p></sec><sec id="sec0004"><label>3</label><title>Data Description</title><p id="para0011">The dataset encompasses a meticulously categorized collection of images capturing various two-phase flow regimes within a gas-liquid system.

These images are systematically organized into four folders: Taylor, Slug, Churn &#x00026; Bubbly.

A 200 GPM pump, connected to a 2-inch steel galvanized pipe, supplied water from the bottom. We supplied air using a compressor through a 3/4-inch galvanized steel line, regulating the flow with a solenoid valve and monitoring it with pressure transducers and a mass flow meter.</p><p id="para0019"><bold>Data Acquisition and Control</bold>: A NI-9188XT system, located in the basement and interfaced with LabVIEW software, managed the system's data acquisition and control. This arrangement allowed for precise adjustments in gas injection and water circulation within the flow loop, employing a solenoid valve for gas and a combination of a variable frequency drive (VFD) and an air-actuated control valve for water flow.</p><p id="para0020"><bold>Video Recording and Analysis</bold>: During the experiments, high-quality videos of the gas-liquid two-phase flow within the annular space were captured using three cameras positioned at equal (length to diameter ratio) intervals along the tower (10 L/D, 25 L/D, 40 L/D). These recordings offered detailed observations of bubble migration and flow regime transitions, serving as the foundation of our dataset. The visual sections were also graduated with a measuring tape to ease estimation of travel distance and subsequently velocities traverse the Tower lab.</p><p id="para0021"><bold>Sensor Deployment</bold>: We installed multiple pressure transducers throughout the flow loop and Coriolis meters (upstream and downstream) to continuously monitor pressure and flow rates, thus ensuring a thorough examination of the flow dynamics within the Tower lab.</p><p id="para0022"><bold>Experimental Procedure</bold>: Our procedure entailed several steps, including filling the water tank, initiating water and air flow, positioning cameras, and starting data recording. Specific actions involved manipulating manual valves, activating the data acquisition system and pumps, and configuring gas injection durations through LabVIEW commands.</p><p id="para0023">This meticulously arranged experimental setup enabled us to amass a comprehensive dataset, shedding light on the various aspects of gas-liquid two-phase flow regimes and offering significant insights into the dynamics of such flows in a controlled environment.</p><p id="para0024">The two experimental scenarios explored were: static scenario (the Tower lab is filled with water to a bottom hole hydrostatic pressure of about 60 psig and not circulating) [<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and a dynamic scenario (water is circulating at a particular average flow rate typically 7 GPM or 15 GPM) [<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Another controlled parameter during the experiment is the Kick Influx Pressure (KIP). Following safety considerations, the Tower lab is limited to an operating pressure of about 100 psig. Thus, the KIP ranged from 70 psig to 95 psig. The influx period ranged from 10 to 120 seconds based on expected flow regimes. As the influx period increases the gas void faction increases thus an evolution in the different gas-liquid two-phase flow regimes.</p></sec><sec id="sec0007"><label>4.2</label><title>Python Script Development for Video Analysis</title><p id="para0025">To enhance our analysis, we developed Python scripts tailored to examine the captured video footage frame-by-frame. These scripts employed advanced image processing techniques to isolate and extract high-resolution images of bubble migration within different two-phase flow regimes, including bubbly, slug, churn, and Taylor flows. By automating the detection and classification of flow patterns, the scripts enabled a more nuanced understanding of flow dynamics, facilitating the quantitative analysis of bubble size distribution, velocity, and phase interaction. This approach significantly augmented our dataset, providing a richer, more detailed perspective on the complex behaviors characteristic of gas-liquid two-phase flows.</p><p id="para0026">The code retrieves the video file from the specified path, it then calculates the number of frames in the video file. The code has the flexibility to get a certain number of frames from the video as per the requirement. From a video the list of frames is extracted and stored in a list data structure. The code iterates through each frame and verifies if the frame was read correctly. Each frame is stored as a NumPy array. Each frame in the list is then converted into a .png format image using <italic>imwrite</italic> function of OpenCV library and stored in the folder as per specified path. The frames are named in the same convention as the videos, i.e. for air, psig_sec_floor_px, where psig, sec and floor are the details at which the video was shot and px stands for the picture x, x is the number of pictures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0008"><title>Limitations</title><p id="para0027">This dataset, while extensive, has several limitations that we must acknowledge. Firstly, although each flow regime category contains over a hundred samples, a larger dataset would enhance the robustness and applicability of the data, particularly for machine learning applications where diversity and volume of data significantly impact model accuracy. Secondly, the absence of images capturing the "annular" flow regime is a notable gap; including such images would provide a more comprehensive view of two-phase flow dynamics, enriching the dataset further. Lastly, the exclusive focus on vertical flow loop conditions means the dataset lacks representation of horizontal or inclined two-phase flow regimes. This limitation restricts the dataset's utility for training models intended to recognize flow patterns in non-vertical orientations, potentially limiting its applicability across different engineering and research contexts.</p></sec><sec id="sec0009"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p id="para0028">The authors have read the ethical requirements for publication in Data in Brief and confirm that the current work does not involve human subjects, animal experiments, or any data collected from social media platforms.</p></sec><sec id="sec1010"><title>Credit Author Statement</title><p id="para1029"><bold>Kaushik Manikonda:</bold> Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Investigation, Resources, Writing - Original Draft, Supervision, Writing - Review &#x00026;
