We identified 1,029 up-regulated and 1,186 down-regulated genes in older individuals, including 17 genes overlapped with known aging-associated genes, such as TFAP2A and Klotho. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed significant alterations in immunoregulatory and metabolic pathways during aging. However, many senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP) involved genes did not exhibit changes in gene expression, suggesting that AS events may reveal additional age-related mechanisms. Aging also altered 6,320 AS events in 4,566 genes, impacting immune-related protein domains. The RNA-binding protein RBMS3 emerged as a key regulator of aging-specific AS events. In addition, neoantigen prediction analyses further identified potential neoantigens generated by aging-related AS events, with the HLA-C14:02 allele presenting the most neoantigenic peptides. Notably, 60 neoantigenic peptides were confirmed using proteomic data from elderly individuals, suggesting their potential as novel targets for anti-aging immunotherapy. Our study provides new insights into the role of alternative splicing in aging, highlights promising avenues for anti-aging immunotherapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>transcriptome analysis</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>immunosenescence</kwd><kwd>neoantigens</kwd><kwd>anti-aging immunotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001"><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China

Key hallmarks of aging include genomic instability, telomere shortening, epigenetic alterations, protein homeostasis imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction, stem cell depletion, and altered cellular communication (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Rando and Wyss-Coray, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Dodig et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Ot&#x000ed;n et al., 2013</xref>). These molecular changes ultimately lead to impaired tissue function and a significantly higher risk of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, particularly after age 60 (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Khosla et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Melzer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Lehallier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Campisi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Oliynyk, 2019</xref>). Current treatments for aging-related diseases are often focused on individual conditions. However, this approach may not address the connections between different diseases, limiting its effectiveness in extending a healthy lifespan. A deeper understanding of the overall mechanisms of aging is crucial for developing better treatments (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Ben-Hur et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Studies have shown that blood contains factors that both promote aging and support rejuvenation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Bieri et al., 2023</xref>). Using heterochronic xenobiotic experiments in which blood from older animals was delivered to younger animals at different time points, multiple phenotypes of accelerated aging were observed in younger recipients (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Villeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Katsimpardi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Rebo et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, AS is a crucial aspect of eukaryotic gene expression, and significant changes in splicing patterns have been observed during aging and senescence (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Desch&#x000ea;nes and Chabot, 2017</xref>). For example, mutations affecting splicing in the <italic>LMNA</italic> gene, which encodes lamin A/C, are known to cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, a condition characterized by premature aging in mice and human (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#x000ed;guez et al., 2016</xref>). In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD), aberrant splicing of susceptibility alleles in genes like <italic>PICALM, CLU</italic>, and <italic>PTK2B</italic> has been implicated in disease progression, further demonstrating the critical role of splicing regulation in age-related disorders (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Raj et al., 2018</xref>). RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which regulate splicing events, display dynamic expression changes in senescent tissues, and many of them are closely linked to the cellular senescence process. For example, SRSF1, QKI, and RBFOX2 are known to be down-regulated in senescent human fibroblasts, affecting global splicing fidelity and senescence-associated phenotypes (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Holly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Blanco et al., 2008</xref>). However, large-scale transcriptomic investigations of aging-specific splicing patterns in human blood remain limited, leaving critical knowledge gaps regarding how AS contributes to immunosenescence and age-related antigenic remodeling.</p><p>Aging is accompanied by chronic inflammation, cellular senescence, and immune decline, creating a vicious cycle between inflammation and aging. Therefore, controlling inflammation may be a key strategy for anti-aging interventions (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Li X. et al., 2023</xref>). As early as 1969, Walford introduced the concept of &#x0201c;immunological theory of aging,&#x0201d; suggesting that immune senescence reduces the body&#x02019;s ability to fight tumors and eliminate senescent cells (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Walford, 1964</xref>). In oncology, abnormal AS has been found to produce new antigens that are recognized by the immune system and trigger immune responses (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>). For instance, mutations in genes regulating RNA splicing are common in hematological malignancies, and intron retention (IR) has been identified as a potential source of tumor neoantigens in multiple myeloma (MM) patients (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2021</xref>). Neoantigens generated from aberrant splicing events may be presented on the cell surface via MHC molecules. These unique peptides, being immunologically novel, can serve as specific targets for engineered T cells in CAR-T therapy (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Frankiw et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, by studying age-specific splicing patterns, we may discover new antigenic epitopes that could serve as targets for anti-aging immunotherapy. NKG2D-CAR T cells have demonstrated the ability to effectively eliminate senescent cells in mouse and non-human primate (NHP) models without inducing significant adverse effects (<xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). Although CAR T-cell therapy has shown promise in aging-related disease models (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Amor et al., 2020</xref>), there is still limited research on aging-specific antigenic epitopes, especially those derived from alternative splicing events. Importantly, clinical application of AS-derived neoantigens in CAR-T or other immunotherapies must proceed with caution, as they may trigger autoimmune responses if not properly filtered for specificity. A key challenge lies in identifying antigens that are uniquely expressed on deleterious senescent cells (<xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2024</xref>), minimizing the risk of off-target effects. Therefore, the discovery of reliable, selective neoantigens is a critical first step. In this study, we systematically analyzed transcriptomic data from 1,255 healthy human blood samples to reveal aging-specific splicing patterns. Aging was found to alter 6,320 AS events in 4,566 genes, significantly affecting immune-related protein domains. Neoantigen prediction analyses further identified potential neoantigens derived from aging-related AS events, with the HLA-C14:02 allele presenting the most neoantigenic peptides. Furthermore, the splicing factor RBMS3 emerged as a potential key regulator of aging-related splicing mechanisms. Importantly, a total of 60 predicted neoantigenic peptides were validated using proteomic data from elderly individuals, highlighting their therapeutic potential. These results not only deepen our understanding of age-associated transcriptomic changes but also provide a strong foundation for advancing anti-aging immunotherapy strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>In this study, we aimed to identify age-related transcriptomic changes by applying stringent sample selection criteria: all included samples required detailed age records, confirmation of healthy donor status, and access to raw, unprocessed sequencing data. We programmatically compiled sample metadata for all human blood transcriptome datasets available in the GEO database and then applied these criteria to identify eligible datasets. Ultimately, 21 datasets comprising 1,255 human blood samples were selected for downstream analysis. RNA sequencing data were downloaded using wget or axel tools. Detailed information on the samples is provided in <xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. Additionally, we collected 307 aging-related genes from the GenAge database (<xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), a core component of the Human Aging Genomic Resources (HAGR), which contains extensive data on genes closely associated with aging processes. To further investigate immune-related changes during aging, we also gathered senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) (<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), immune gene sets (<xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Yoshihara et al., 2013</xref>), and inflammatory factor gene sets (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) from published literature (<xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). To validate the presence of predicted neoantigens in old individuals, we retrieved proteomic data from three blood sample datasets (PXD034030, PXD033493, PXD050061; detailed in <xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S3</xref>
<bold>)</bold> from the ProteomeXchange database, a global repository for proteomics data (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Vizca&#x000ed;no et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RNA-seq data processing</title><p>First, quality control and filtering of the downloaded fastq data was performed using fastp (v0.22.0) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Sequencing reads with junctions, excessive undetermined bases (N), or low quality scores were removed. The following parameters were applied to optimize the process: window size was set to 16 (-w 16), minimum quality threshold was set to 25 (-q 25), minimum read length was set to 45 (-length_required 45), and a maximum of five unidentified bases were allowed (-n_base_limit 5). After filtering, the data were aligned to the reference human genome (GRCh38) downloaded from the GENCODE project. The genome index was generated using HISAT2 (v2.1.0) (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2019</xref>), and each sample was individually aligned to generate BAM files. The BAM files were then converted to SAM files using SAMtools (v1.5) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Transcript assembly and quantification of gene and transcript expression levels were performed using StringTie (v2.1.2) (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Pertea et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, to quantify gene expression across all samples, featureCounts (v2.0.3) (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2014</xref>) was used for gene-level quantification.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Principal component analysis, gene expression analysis, enrichment analysis</title><p>To account for potential batch effects arising from the use of multiple GEO datasets, we first applied the removeBatchEffect function (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) in the limma package, incorporating both dataset source and sex as covariates. Differentially expressed genes were then identified using the limma package (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Smyth, 2004</xref>), with significance thresholds set at p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 and |log2FC| &#x0003e; 1. To further explore the biological significance of these differentially expressed genes, we employed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify significantly upregulated and down-regulated biological processes (upregulation: p-value &#x0003c; 0.05, |NES| &#x0003e; 1; down-regulation: p-value &#x0003c; 0.05, NES &#x0003c; &#x02212;1). All results were visualized using ggplot2. Additionally, we used the gene set scoring function in GSEA to score samples from juvenile and elderly groups based on senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), immune response, and inflammation-related gene sets. Violin plots were generated using the ggpubr package to illustrate these scores. Venn diagrams were used to illustrate the overlap between gene sets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Alternative splicing analysis</title><p>In this study, AS analysis was conducted on BAM files from the old and young sample groups using rMATS (v4.1.2) (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) to identify differential splicing events between the two groups. A junction counting (JC) approach was applied to quantify each AS event by targeting read and splice counts. All AS events were rigorously screened based on the criteria of absolute inclusion level difference (deltaPSI &#x0003e; 0.1) and false discovery rate (FDR &#x0003c; 0.05) between the old and young groups. Significant differential splicing events were visualized using volcano plots. The chromosomal distribution of differential AS events was determined based on genomic coordinates provided in the rMATS output files. Additionally, the overlap of these splicing changes was calculated and visualized using the upsetR package.</p><p>For genes associated with significant differential splicing events, we first performed protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using the STRING database (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Wagner and Fischer, 1974</xref>) to identify key network nodes and functional modules. The PPI network data were then imported into Cytoscape for further topology analysis and visualization editing. We then applied the rMATS output to rMAPS2 (version 2.0.0) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>) for binding motif enrichment analysis. The analysis focused on the binding motifs of 115 known RNA-binding proteins, with significantly spliced regions serving as the target regions and non-significantly spliced regions used to estimate background binding levels. For motif enrichment analysis, we set 250 base pairs (bp) and 50&#x000a0;bp as the lengths for intronic and exonic regions, respectively, to examine and map the distribution of motifs associated with splicing events. In addition, ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression was used to calculate the correlation between Percent Spliced In (PSI) values and the expression levels of genes with differential splicing events. Venn diagrams were used to depict the overlap between the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), immune gene set, and inflammatory factor gene set. The top 200 genes associated with significantly different splicing events were selected for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using the clusterProfiler package (<xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Neopeptides prediction</title><p>We obtained unspliced isoforms using chromosomal position information from the reference genome (GRCh38), including chromosome numbers and the start and stop base pair positions of each gene. Based on the rMATS analysis results, we deleted, added, or modified exons of the unspliced transcripts to construct spliced isoforms. Python scripts were used to compare the coding sequences (CDS) of spliced and unspliced isoforms for each differential splicing event.</p><p>Next, we applied InterProScan (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2014</xref>) to search for protein structural domains in the Pfam database and used R scripts to identify splicing events that overlapped with these domains. Using the translate function, we translated unspliced and spliced transcripts into amino acid sequences, which were divided into 9-amino acid peptides using a sliding-window technique (moving one residue at a time).</p><p>Additionally, we constructed peptide libraries using gffread (v0.11.4) (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Pertea and Pertea, 2020</xref>), by translating transcripts quantified by StringTie (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Pertea et al., 2015</xref>) from young and middle-aged samples into amino acid sequences, which were also split into 9-mer peptides.

Peptides with a binding score below the 5% threshold were selected as potential neoantigen candidates. Using makeblastdb, we constructed a custom amino acid database from all peptide sequences derived from the mass spectrometry data of three elderly blood proteomic datasets (PXD034030, PXD033493, and PXD050061). The predicted neoantigenic peptide sequences were then searched against this database using the blastp algorithm. Peptides with 100% sequence identity and matching gene annotations were classified as fully matched neoantigenic peptides. For these fully matched peptides, the corresponding protein subcellular localizations were retrieved from the UniProt database to evaluate their membrane association and immunological accessibility.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Comprehensive transcriptome analysis revealed the age-related gene in human blood</title><p>We collected 21 datasets with RNA-seq data and age information from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), comprising a total of 1,255 healthy human blood transcriptome samples for further analysis.

These changes in CDS regions and structural domains suggest that significant splicing events not only affect aging-related immune functions, but may also generate new antigens.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>FIGURE 6</label><caption><p>Identification and characterization of aging-associated AS-derived neoantigens. <bold>(A)</bold> Grouped pie chart showing the number and proportion of splicing events with identical (blue) or distinct (green) coding sequences (CDS) across the five types of AS events. <bold>(B)</bold> Bar chart displaying the number of splicing events affecting protein structural domains for each AS type. <bold>(C)</bold> Top 10 biological processes (BP) identified through GO enrichment analysis of genes associated with AS events that affect protein structural domains (p &#x0003c; 0.05). <bold>(D)</bold> Heatmap illustrating the most frequently impacted protein structural domains.

Alternative splicing (AS), which regulates gene expression and protein diversity, plays an important role in cancer prognosis. Neoantigens generated by AS could serve as key targets for anti-tumor vaccines or CAR T-cell therapies (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Wickland et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2024</xref>). Although aging and cancer have distinct features, they share commonalities like genomic instability and epigenetic changes. During aging, senescent cells produce more senescence-associated self-peptides (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Marin et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>This study also explores neoantigens induced by aging-related splicing events. Neoantigen prediction analyses were conducted for significantly upregulated splicing events during aging. Amino acid sequences from spliced and unspliced isoforms were obtained, and these proteins were cleaved into 9-mer peptides. Potential neoantigenic peptides were identified by excluding the peptides normally expressed in adolescent and middle-aged individuals. Using the NetMHCpan-4.1 prediction algorithm, we assessed the likelihood of these new peptides binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and Methods). The results showed that transcripts with CDS alterations across five splicing types generated numerous neo-peptides, with about a quarter showing strong MHC binding affinity, suggesting that they could serve as candidate neoantigens in aging.</p><p>Population-level analysis of HLA alleles revealed that some alleles presented more neoantigenic peptides than others. HLA-C14:02 presented the highest number of neoantigenic fragments (1,254), with a detection rate of 1.9%, while HLA-A02:01 was the most commonly detected allele, present in 4.9% of older samples and presenting 532 neoantigenic peptides (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). These findings suggest the feasibility of anti-aging vaccine development based on these peptides. In addition, neoantigenic peptides in aged samples were more likely to be presented by the HLA-B allele (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>), suggesting that HLA-B may be a preferred target for anti-aging vaccines. Further analysis identified 28 neoantigenic peptides present in all elderly samples (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>), and 60 potential neoantigenic peptides that validated by mass spectrometry-based proteomics data from elderly individuals (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>; <xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S10</xref>). Notably, peptides produced through MXE splicing were associated with the senescence-related gene <italic>UBE2D2</italic>, which encodes a ubiquitin-binding enzyme essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and delaying aging (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Hunt et al., 2024</xref>). These findings support the aberrant production of neoantigenic peptides in the elderly population and highlight the potential for immunotherapy targeting these peptides in anti-aging treatments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The biological process of aging involves genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic modifications, and disruptions in protein homeostasis (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Ot&#x000ed;n et al., 2023</xref>). These changes compromise physiological integrity over time, leading to organ dysfunction and an increased risk of age-related diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular conditions. While current therapies target these complications, their effectiveness in extending a healthy lifespan is limited. The immune system also undergoes significant age-related changes, such as altered immune cell composition, increased inflammation, and functional decline (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Mogilenko et al., 2022</xref>). Despite these insights, identifying effective targets for anti-aging immunotherapy remains a challenge, necessitating a deeper understanding of the aging mechanisms.</p><p>In this study, transcriptomic analysis was conducted on blood samples from individuals across various age groups to investigate changes in gene expression and alternative splicing patterns associated with aging. Data from 1,255 healthy samples obtained from the GEO database were categorized into young, middle-aged, and old groups (ages 8&#x02013;87&#x000a0;years), based on developmental and molecular aging patterns supported by previous studies. Given our study&#x02019;s focus on aging-specific alternative splicing (AS), a groupwise comparison between biologically distant age extremes offers greater sensitivity. Previous work has demonstrated that AS changes are more evident at developmental boundaries than during midlife (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2025</xref>). In addition, our splicing analysis tool, rMATS, supports only binary group comparisons and does not accommodate continuous age modeling. PSI values were also unavailable for middle-aged individuals, limiting the feasibility of regression analysis. Including this large middle-aged cohort in either group would introduce imbalance and confound interpretability. Therefore, we focused on young vs. old comparisons for transcriptomic and splicing analyses, and utilized the middle-aged cohort <italic>post hoc</italic> to filter splicing noise and minimize false-positive neoantigen identification. Although the young and old groups differ in sample size, our balanced resampling analysis (10 iterations of randomly selecting 80 young individuals) produced comparable results to those obtained using all young samples, both in terms of the number of differentially expressed genes and the identification of shared genes. These findings suggest that the observed transcriptomic differences between age groups are not merely artifacts of sampling imbalance, but likely reflect genuine biological variation. To begin, we compared the transcriptomes of the young and old groups, and the results showed that only a few of the differentially expressed genes overlapped with known aging, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), immune, and inflammatory gene sets. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated downregulation of immune-related pathways, such as phagocytosis and complement activation, and upregulation of pathways linked to antioxidant metabolism, energy production, and oxygen transport during aging. These findings align with those of Lorna W. Harries et al., who observed a small number of age-related transcripts using transcriptome microarray technology on human blood leukocytes from individuals aged 30&#x02013;104&#x000a0;years (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Harries et al., 2011</xref>). In their study, only 295 out of 16,571 transcripts (&#x0223c;2%) were strongly associated with aging, including several linked to inflammation and immune senescence. Although our dataset represents the most comprehensive RNA sequencing data available for healthy older individuals in the GEO database as of June 2023, the smaller sample size in the older age group may impact statistical robustness. Including more elderly samples in future studies would improve the depth and reliability of these findings. Moreover, Harries et al. highlighted the role of mRNA processing in aging, providing valuable insights for exploring alternative splicing in our study. Our RNA sequencing approach offers advantages over microarray technology, particularly for analyzing splicing isoforms and alternative splicing events.</p><p>Current research into aging mechanisms has expanded from DNA damage and protein homeostasis to RNA processing. In particular, mRNA splicing, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and generating protein diversity, has been closely linked to aging and longevity interventions (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bhadra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Baralle and Romano, 2023</xref>). Holly et al. reported increased alternative splicing events in senescent fibroblasts and endothelial cells (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Holly et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, Stegeman et al. identified variable splicing changes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, underscoring the conserved role of splicing in senescence across species (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Stegeman et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, variable splicing patterns in human blood increased with age, and retention of introns (RI) significantly rose, consistent with aging signatures identified by Adusumalli et al. (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adusumalli et al., 2019</xref>). The choice of alternative splicing analysis tool can affect the interpretation of results. The rMATS tool, which uses predefined splicing models and compares splicing patterns between sample sets, is more efficient and accurate than tools like LeafCutter for large datasets (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Aktas et al., 2022</xref>). We used the rMATS tool, identifying 6,320 splicing events associated with aging across 4,566 genes. To address concerns about sample imbalance, we applied a single balanced resampling step by selecting 80 young individuals and comparing them to the old group, due to the computational demands and BAM-format input required by rMATS. As shown in <xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>, the number of genes involved in significantly altered AS events&#x02014;except for SE&#x02014;was higher in old individuals, consistent with results from the all sample. Additionally, <xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref> shows a substantial overlap between AS-related genes identified in the resampled subset and those from the all comparison, although some differences remained. These differences may reflect the increased sensitivity of AS detection to sample size, noise, and methodological constraints. Nonetheless, the similarity in trends supports the validity of using all samples to capture aging-associated splicing alterations. The 4,566 genes affected by splicing alterations included many that overlapped with known aging, SASP, immune, and inflammatory gene sets. And these genes are involved in regulating protein metabolism, immune responses, and signaling pathways, suggesting that splicing alterations could be valuable targets for anti-aging immunotherapy. Dysregulated pre-mRNA splicing can lead to age-associated pathological conditions, and fine-tuning the regulation of splicing factors could delay aging and treat age-related diseases (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Angarola and Anczuk&#x000f3;w, 2021</xref>). For example, splicing factors such as HNRNPA1 and TIA1 are strongly associated with aging and aging-related diseases (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Apicco et al., 2018</xref>), and both ranked highly in our splicing factor correlation results. Notably, RBMS3 was found to be highly correlated with splicing events across all five splicing types, suggesting that its dysregulation may play an important role in the splicing patterns of aging. RBMS3 belongs to the MSSP family of RNA-binding proteins and has been characterized as a tumor suppressor gene involved in apoptosis, post-transcriptional mRNA regulation, and fibrosis. Tumorigenesis is an age-associated process, and reduced RBMS3 expression has been linked to poor prognosis in various cancers (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Li Wen et al., 2023</xref>). Recent studies have also suggested that RBMS3 may be involved in immune regulation and aging. Specifically, RBMS3 suppression was found to downregulate PD-L1 and enhance immune responses (<xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>), while metformin treatment increased RBMS3 expression and promoted ferroptosis in ovarian cancer cells (<xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2025</xref>). As metformin has been shown to reset aging clocks and delay aging in primates (<xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2024</xref>), these findings raise the possibility that RBMS3 could participate in the regulation of immunosenescence and age-associated cellular remodeling. These findings highlight a strong link between changes in splicing patterns during aging and immune senescence, which may lead to the identification of new targets for anti-aging immunotherapy.</p><p>In cancer therapy, personalized vaccines targeting neoantigens can be developed by predicting variable splicing mutations in tumor cells, stimulating a specific immune response against the tumors (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Lybaert et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2023</xref>). Given the similarities between cancer and aging, the discovery of age-specific neoantigens has become a major research focus. Vaccines have already entered clinical trials for age-related diseases such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (<xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Hovakimyan et al., 2024</xref>). Amor et al. analyzed the transcriptome of senescent cells and identified proteins widely expressed and specifically anchored to cell membranes, which can serve as CAR T cell targets for the removal of senescent cells (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Amor et al., 2024</xref>). Following the workflow of Rui Cheng et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>), we identified new epitopes generated by specific variable splicing during aging and validated 60 neoantigenic peptides using mass spectrometry-based proteomics data from elderly individuals. Notably, several of these peptides are derived from membrane-associated proteins, suggesting their potential accessibility to immune surveillance. However, due to the limitations of sequence-based analyses, these findings require further experimental validation to assess their immunogenicity and therapeutic applicability. Future studies will focus on experimentally confirming the surface presentation of these neoantigens and evaluating their potential as targets for anti-aging immunotherapies.</p><p>Despite providing valuable insights, our study has several limitations. Although we accounted for sex as a confounding factor&#x02014;an adjustment that showed minimal impact on differential expression outcomes in our dataset (<xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figures S4A,B</xref>)&#x02014;other demographic and environmental variables such as ethnicity, comorbidities, medication use, diet, and socioeconomic status may also influence gene expression and splicing profiles. We incorporated all available clinical metadata from the public datasets used; however, detailed annotations were often incomplete. This lack of comprehensive metadata may limit the generalizability and interpretability of our findings. Future studies incorporating more comprehensive sample-level annotations could better account for the influence of additional confounding variables on age-related transcriptomic changes. Moreover, While neoantigens derived from aging-associated splicing events present promising therapeutic opportunities, their use in immunotherapy must be approached cautiously (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2024</xref>). Aging tissues may express peptides that were not encountered during thymic development, potentially bypassing central tolerance (<xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2023</xref>) and raising the risk of autoimmunity (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Mustelin and Andrade, 2024</xref>). The aging immune system exhibits altered peripheral tolerance and a pro-inflammatory environment, which could exacerbate immune-related side effects. Similar risks have been observed in cancer CAR-T therapies, where even low-level antigen expression in normal tissues can result in severe toxicity (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Sebastian-Valverde and Pasinetti, 2020</xref>). Strategies such as stringent target selection (e.g., membrane-bound proteins highly enriched in senescent cells) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Flugel et al., 2023</xref>), combinatorial antigen gating, and built-in safety switches may help mitigate these effects (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Liu, 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, the use of CAR-T cells or other immune strategies against aging-related neoantigens should be regarded as exploratory, requiring thorough preclinical validation to ensure specificity, safety, and immune tolerance (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Feucht and Abou-El-Enein, 2020</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this study investigated age-related changes in gene expression and their association with immune system decline using blood transcriptome analysis. We uncovered distinct patterns of alternative splicing associated with human aging and identified novel antigens produced by abnormal splicing events that may serve as promising targets for anti-aging immunotherapy. Our study provides new insights into alternative splicing during aging, highlights promising avenues for anti-aging immunotherapy, and advances our understanding of immunosenescence.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The raw data and the analysis codes are available in the <xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Material</xref> and made publicly available at GitHub repository via <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/lsh74/ASNPB" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/lsh74/ASNPB</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="s6"><title>Author contributions</title><p>SL: Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Writing &#x02013; review and editing.
