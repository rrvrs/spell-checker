Multiple factors affect the mortality of patients who had cardiac arrest and subsequently CPR, such as the timing at which CPR is started. Due to the scarcity of local evidence regarding cardiac arrest in Saudi Arabia, this study aims to identify the predictors of CPR success and survival rate, namely, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Factors that will be investigated are gender, timing, initial rhythm, and whether the cardiac arrest was witnessed.</p><p>Methods</p><p>A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who had cardiac arrest and CPR in National Guard Health Affairs in Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted in the Riyadh, Jeddah, and Al-Ahsa regions. The study's total sample was 949 patients, as 857 patients were from Riyadh, 58 patients were from Jeddah, and&#x000a0;34 patients were from&#x000a0;Al-Ahsa.

Statistically speaking, female patients were more likely to have ROSC than male patients, with a percentage of 25.7% versus 19.1%, respectively (p = 0.0231). Also, patients who had ROSC had a mean duration before starting CPR of 4.95 minutes. However, patients who passed away had a mean duration before initiating CPR of 19.81 minutes (p &#x0003c; 0.0001).</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Statistical analysis revealed that multiple factors can affect the mortality of patients who had cardiac arrest, one of which is gender, duration before initiating CPR, whether the cardiac arrest was witnessed, and the initial rhythm of the cardiac arrest. However, further local and international prospective designs are essential to study the variable factors&#x000a0;that can affect the success rate of CPR, mainly ROSC. One of the factors that could not be measured in this study is cultural differences in response times.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>ambulance</kwd><kwd>cardiac arrest</kwd><kwd>cardiopulmonary resuscitation</kwd><kwd>cpr</kwd><kwd>duration of cpr</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>According to the American Heart Association (AHA), cardiac arrest is defined as the sudden loss of the heart's function [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cardiac arrest is caused when there is a malfunction in the heart's electrical system, which causes the person's heart to stop pumping [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sudden cardiac arrest can be fatal if not addressed quickly [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In other research, it was shown that delay in the initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)&#x000a0;caused a decrease in survival rates [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. CPR, the use of a defibrillator, or even simple chest compressions can increase the odds of survival until help arrives, and with adequate medical attention, survival is feasible [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the United States, 200,000 episodes of in-hospital cardiac arrest and 356,000 episodes of cardiac arrest are documented each year [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. According to a meta-analysis regarding the survival rate of in-hospital CPR, the immediate survival rate is 40.7%, and the survival-to-discharge rate is 13.4% [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A local study regarding in-hospital CPR has also proven that the initial success rate of CPR does not equal the survival-to-discharge rate. The estimated survival rate for immediate resuscitation is 64%, yet the survival-to-discharge rate is 30% [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Multiple factors affect CPR's success, such as the timing at which CPR is started [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. According to the AHA, if advanced life support is initiated within three to five minutes following cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, the survival rate increases by 50% [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, for every minute that defibrillation is delayed, the likelihood of recovery is reduced by 7-10% [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Regarding age and gender, a study done in the hospital of Kermanshah in 2013 revealed that the age and sex of the patients had no statistically significant link with CPR success rate [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. On the other hand, a study by the AHA showed that females and those younger were likely to have longer durations of resuscitation. One possible explanation is that the health care providers have a perceived notion that these patients will benefit from more extended trial CPR. Even though some data suggest that there are no differences in demographics, other data from different literature stated that patients who were male, older, non-white, and admitted from a skilled care facility had a reduced chance of survival [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In summary, age, gender, race, cause of the event, comorbidities, location of arrest, and hospital factors all affect the outcomes of CPR. Since evidence is scarce regarding factors that affect the survival rate of CPR in the National Guard Health Affairs (NGHA), it is important to conduct this study to acknowledge the factors that affect survival, which may lead to a change in hospital practices if there are variables that significantly affect the success rate of CPR. The aim and significance of this study are to evaluate the risk factors in patients who experienced cardiac arrests to have better outcomes and a greater survival rate. Also, the result of this study could help determine future guidelines and protocols.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Ethical approval</p><p>This study was approved by the King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC) Institutional Review Board (study number: NRJ22J/156/05). Since all patients' information was kept confidential, no explicit consent from patients was necessary for this study.</p><p>Design and setting</p><p>This is a multi-center retrospective cohort study that investigated the medical records of patients who had at least one episode of cardiac arrest in NGHA&#x000a0;hospitals in Jeddah, Riyadh, and Al-Ahsa in Saudi Arabia in the period between April 2017 and August 2022. The investigators opted for a retrospective study since there is a large number of prior patients that have not been investigated in the past. This study's missing data resulted from the study design since some healthcare workers may not have documented the full details of the cardiac arrest cases.</p><p>The sampling technique was a non-probability consecutive sampling technique with a total number of 949 patients. The data on cardiac arrest cases was collected using the hospital information system in NGHA (BestCare).</p><p>The qualitative variables measured in this study were age, gender, the state of the cardiac arrest, the initial rhythm of the patient during cardiac arrest and whether the rhythm has changed, the final rhythm after the cardiac arrest, whether the patient required intubation, complications of the cardiac arrest, and the outcome of the cardiac arrest. The initial rhythm in this study is defined as the first rhythm that appeared in the electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to or during the CPR process. The final rhythm in this study is defined as&#x000a0;the rhythm that is observed in the ECG following the completion of CPR. Also,&#x000a0;return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is the immediate pulse return in patients after the cardiac arrest intervention. In addition, shockable rhythm in this study includes ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.</p><p>Furthermore, the quantitative data sets measured in this study were the durations related to the CPR, such as the duration before starting CPR, the duration of ambulance response to home, the duration till the ambulance arrived at the emergency department (ED), the total duration of CPR, and the number of shocks given to patients.</p><p>The inclusion criteria include patients with a documented code blue episode in NGHA hospital. The exclusion criteria consist&#x000a0;of pediatric patients aged &#x0003c;18 years old, patients who signed a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) form, and patients who did not have an episode of cardiac arrest (falsely reported code blue). Falsely reported code blue involves&#x000a0;patients who seem unconscious but still&#x000a0;have a pulse, thus indicating a state other than a cardiac arrest.</p><p>Data analysis</p><p>This study used J. Macintosh Project (JMP) Pro 17.0.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, USA) for statistical analysis. The categorical data included&#x000a0;age, gender, cardiac arrest state, state of intubation, cardiac arrest complication, cardiac arrest outcome, initial rhythm, change in rhythm, and final rhythm, and they were depicted by percentages and frequencies. The numerical data in this study included&#x000a0;duration before CPR, duration till the ambulance arrived home, duration till the ambulance arrived at the ED, and the number of shocks; mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to depict the data.</p><p>The significance of the qualitative-to-qualitative data was depicted by chi-square. The independent T-test depicted the significance of the parametric qualitative-to-quantitative inferential data, and the significance of the non-parametric qualitative-to-quantitative data was measured using the Mann-Whitney U test. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Demographics of the patients</p><p>Among the 949 cases of cardiac arrest, 672 (70.8%) were male patients, and 277 (29.2%) were female patients.

Another complication that was a direct result of CPR was rib fracture, which was documented in six cases.</p><p>In some cases of cardiac arrest, there were factors that disturbed the CPR process. For example, family disturbance and overcrowding were reported in 10 different cases. Also, late arrival of staff was reported in three&#x000a0;cases. Similarly, dysfunctional equipment was reported in three cases.</p><p>Outcome&#x000a0;of cardiopulmonary resuscitation</p><p>Five hundred forty-four cases (57.3%) achieved a ROSC&#x000a0;after the first CPR process.

Other studies also showed that witnessed and shorter-duration CPR cases were associated with higher survival rates [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As mentioned before, the time till initiation also appears to greatly affect the outcome in patients. The greater the delay in initiating CPR, the less likely the patient will survive. There are studies with observational evidence from the prehospital setting that show lower survival rates with greater lengths of time before initiating CPR [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This research's findings align with others' conclusions regarding the duration of CPR and the time till initiation of CPR and expected outcomes.</p><p>Complications of CPR</p><p>CPR is life-saving but at times associated with several complications, mainly due to the nature of the resuscitative efforts. The three main complications observed in our study were IV cannula failure, intubation failure, and rib fractures. Failure rates in the emergency setting are relatively common, as a 10-40% failure rate is described in the literature [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These rates could point us toward&#x000a0;depending on alternative routes of medication administration, such as intraosseous access. Another main complication observed, intubation failure, is also fairly common, as first-pass success rates are reported to range between 59% and 98% [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. With this in mind, steps should be taken to explore further and implement supportive measures to enhance intubation success, such as optimizing patient positioning, effectively managing bloody airways, and providing training to improve first-pass intubation rates. The last main complication, rib fractures, has been reported in the literature to be the most common CPR-related injury, with prevalence reported to be 55% among patients undergoing CPR [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This highlights the need for providers to be mindful of CPR-related injuries, especially rib fractures, and reduce risk when possible.</p><p>Demographics</p><p>The majority of patients in this study (90.3%) were from the Riyadh region. This can be explained since Riyadh is the capital city of Saudi Arabia and thus has a higher population than Jeddah and Al-Ahsa.</p><p>Out of the 949 patients with cardiac arrest, 672 (70.8%) were men and 277 (29.2%) were women. In this study, 25.7% of female patients were discharged alive, while only 19.1% of males were discharged alive. This finding is in opposition to the findings of other studies, where females were usually the gender with a lower survival rate [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. One study found that while most patients experiencing cardiac arrest were men (62.6%), women (37.4%) who were resuscitated after cardiac arrest had lower survival rates from hospital admission to discharge [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In another study, it was observed that women were less likely than men to receive bystander resuscitation. Moreover, when women did receive resuscitation, their survival rates were lower compared to men, a disparity partially attributed to differences in resuscitation characteristics, particularly a lower proportion of shockable initial rhythms [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The setting where cardiac arrests occur is crucial as it significantly impacts the outcome. In this study, 71.7% (680 patients) had an unwitnessed cardiac arrest, 25.9% (246 patients) occurred in the ED and were witnessed, and only a small proportion of 2.4% (23 cases) were witnessed by paramedics. Unwitnessed cardiac arrests were linked with poorer outcomes. This is in line with another study, which found that arrests that were not witnessed had a significantly lower likelihood of ROSC&#x000a0;and discharge survival [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This could be explained because unwitnessed arrests have delayed the start of CPR.</p><p>On the other hand, the witnessed arrests were associated with better survival since the treatment was initiated immediately. The survival rate of witnessed cardiac arrests was reported to be 2.81 times higher than that of unwitnessed cases [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Rhythm in cardiopulmonary resuscitation</p><p>Initial rhythm is a factor that needs to be looked at in a more detailed manner. In our study, only 28 patients out of 171 with shockable rhythm survived, which is a small number given that there is evidence that the survival rate has increased recently. For example, a study conducted over the span of 30 years in Sweden showed an increase in shockable rhythm survival, with a documented increase in overall survival from 14.4% in 1990 to 35.8% in 2020. This could be explained by the rapid improvement in the protocols as the patients started to receive CPR and critical time interventions such as percutaneous coronary intervention more and in a timely manner [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This could be one of the reasons shockable rhythm had such a low survival chance, as a delay in invention, such as a defibrillation, could be a contributing factor. Another discrepancy between this study and others is regarding the initial rhythm with the highest probability of survival. In this study, patients who had pulseless electrical activity (36.5%) had the highest percentage of being discharged alive. The &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; category is not representative of survival despite having the highest percentage, as it does not describe one specific rhythm. Contrary to our findings, other studies showed that ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was the initial rhythm with the highest probability of survival [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Procedures</p><p>Seven hundred forty-five cases of CPR had information regarding intubation; only 13.7% were intubated before the start of CPR, 40.5% were intubated during the resuscitation process, and 45.8% did not require intubation. Moreover, data from a national registry of over 150,000 in-hospital&#x000a0;cardiac&#x000a0;arrests across more than 650 hospitals found that endotracheal intubation was utilized in about 70% of cardiac arrest cases. However, the intubation rate across hospitals varied widely&#x000a0;from 27% to 100%, and in patients with no respiratory failure, lower intubation rates were associated with higher survival [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies on cardiac arrest have shown that reducing intubation during CPR may improve the outcome [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For instance, a comparison of different resuscitation methods that reduced intubation showed better outcomes in terms of survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Delayed intubation has especially been looked at in situations where the cardiac arrest was cardiac in origin with a shockable rhythm; in these cases, limiting intubation and concentrating on chest compressions may improve survival [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. On the other hand, in patients with clinical symptoms of respiratory failure before cardiac arrest, the survival rate was not affected by intubation [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This means that intubation may be more beneficial to patients with problems that are respiratory in origin rather than cardiac. This result suggests that there is an incentive to investigate an approach that minimizes intubation in patients with an arrest of cardiac origin.</p><p>Limitation</p><p>One of the limitations of this research is the study design. Retrospective studies may lead to confounding factors that can be avoided by utilizing prospective studies. Therefore, future studies on the topic of cardiac arrest and CPR are best to be conducted prospectively. Also, the sampling technique used in this study was&#x000a0;non-probability consecutive sampling. Thus, the authors recommend employing a randomized probability sampling technique in further studies.&#x000a0;Although this study excluded some factors, such as DNR, some factors may also contribute to the patient's morbidity and mortality in the form of confounding factors, such as using a pacemaker or an implantable&#x000a0;cardioverter-defibrillator. Another area of improvement for further literature is the methodology part. We suggest applying multivariable analysis represented by an adjusted odds ratio to limit the effect of the confounding factors.&#x000a0;Lastly, even though the large sample size can be a strength utilized in this study, it raises the chances of uncovering statistically significant results irrespective of their clinical relevance in the topic of cardiac arrest. Moreover, the sample size of this study, although large, is not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions; further local and international research is necessary to study the variables that affect the efficacy of CPR in cardiac arrest cases and to investigate the variables that increase or decrease the survival rate of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There were multiple significant findings in this study, most notably that the time to initiation of CPR and the setting in which CPR occurs significantly affect the survival of patients. Most findings are consistent with those available in the literature with some minor differences. Unwitnessed cardiac arrests unfortunately remain to be a challenge with poor survival outcomes. More large multicenter studies are required to draw definitive conclusions regarding the factors that affect survival to then create protocols that can improve in-hospital resuscitative measures and create strategies to better the outcomes of out-of-hospital unwitnessed occurrences.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
