During membrane fusion, the lyssavirus glycoprotein undergoes a series of low-pH-induced conformational transitions. Here, we report the structures of Ikoma lyssavirus and Mokola lyssavirus glycoproteins, with which we believe that we have trapped the proteins in pre-fusion and post-fusion states respectively. By analyzing the available lyssaviral glycoprotein structures, we present a sequential conformation-transition model, in which two structural elements in the glycoprotein undergo fine-modulated secondary structural transitions, changing the glycoprotein from a bended hairpin conformation to an extended linear conformation. In addition, such conformational change is further facilitated, as observed in our surface plasmon resonance assay, by the pH-regulated interactions between the membrane-proximal region and the pleckstrin homology and the fusion domains. The structural features elucidated in this study will facilitate the design of vaccines and anti-viral drugs against lyssaviruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Lyssavirus, as represented by the prototypic rabies virus, is responsible for approximately 60,000 human fatalities annually. The glycoprotein of lyssavirus is a key factor mediating the low pH-induced membrane fusion of the viral envelope with the host cells. It is proposed that lyssavirus glycoprotein will experience a series of structural transitions in response to low environmental pH. Nevertheless, a detailed structural transition model remains to be atomically illustrated. In this study, we determined two crystal structures of lyssavirus glycoproteins at pH-8.3 and pH-4.0, which have trapped the glycoprotein in the pre-fusion and post-fusion states, respectively. By analysing the two newly resolved lyssavirus glycoprotein structures, together with two rabies virus glycoprotein structures reported previously, we identified two structural elements in the glycoprotein with fine-modulated secondary structural changes. Furthermore, we also proposed a detailed spatial-temporal structure-transition model for the glycoprotein along with pH-decrease, which could guide the vaccine and drug design against lyssavirus.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Currently, 17 lyssaviruses have been identified in this genus [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], some of which can infect humans and other mammals, causing lethal acute encephalitis described as rabies or rabies-like diseases [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Lyssaviruses can be further subdivided into three phylogenetic groups (phylogroup-1, -2, and -3), among which the prototype virus, rabies virus (RABV), is classified as a phylogroup-1 member and is by far the most common causative agent for human rabies. This disease leads to nearly 100% mortality after the onset of clinical symptoms even with advanced supportive care. Human rabies is estimated to cause ~60,000 deaths worldwide each year and imposes a huge social burden [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In comparison to the classical RABV, the other 16 lyssaviruses are often referred to as rabies-related lyssavirus or non-RABV lyssavirus.</p><p>Glycoprotein (G), as the sole protein on the virion surface, is a key factor mediating lyssavirus invasion. It is also the major target for neutralizing antibodies and the crucial protein antigen for vaccine development. At the first stage of virus invasion, lyssavirus G is responsible for engaging receptors on host cells. Several potential cellular receptors/components have been identified for their ability to facilitate RABV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. After receptor engagement, lyssavirus enters the cell via an endocytic pathway, during which the G protein undergoes a series of pH-dependent conformational transitions to catalyze the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membranes, thereby initiating the infection [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The lyssavirus G, which belongs to the rhabdovirus G family, has been defined as a class III viral membrane-fusion protein [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Along membrane fusion induced by low pH, studies in RABV have demonstrated that lyssavirus G could transit among different conformational states [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been proposed that these states exist as a pH-dependent thermodynamic equilibrium, such that it is shifted from the pre-fusion state towards the post-fusion state as pH descends [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This results in a reversible structural transition in lyssavirus G, differentiating it from the class I viral membrane-fusion glycoprotein (for example, influenza virus hemagglutinin and coronavirus spike), for which the low-pH-induced transition is primed by proteolytic cleavage and the transition is irreversible [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is believed that such reversibility would allow the protein to recover its native pre-fusion conformation after its transport through the acidic compartments during secretion [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Members of the <italic toggle="yes">Vesiculovirus</italic> genus in the <italic toggle="yes">Rhabdoviridae</italic> family, as represented by the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), are also featured with reversible transitions in the glycoprotein [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

In addition, several structures proposed to have trapped the protein in different intermediate states are subsequently reported for another vesiculovirus, Chandipura virus (CHAV) [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These structures reveal that vesiculovirus G consists of three individual domains: a fusion domain (FD), a pleckstrin homology domain (PHD), and a central domain (CD). In response to low pH, large domain-rearrangements occur, leading the protein from a bended hairpin conformation into an extended linear conformation.</p><p>Structural characterization of lyssavirus G are attracting wide attention in recent years. The first atomic picture of the lyssavirus protein is depicted based on two ecto-domain structures of RABV G (RABV-G), which are proposed to have trapped the protein in an early-intermediate and a late-intermediate state, respectively [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Similar to its vesiculovirus homolog, RABV-G also consists of three domains: FD, PHD, and CD. These three domains arrange into an overall bended architecture in the early-intermediate structure and re-arrange into an extended architecture in the late-intermediate structure. Another study has reported the crystal structure for the ecto-domain of Mokola lyssavirus G (MOKV-G). The structure (named MOKV-G<sub>1-436</sub>*) also shows an extended conformation and seems to more resemble that observed in the post-fusion VSV-G [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is interesting that the crystal of MOKV-G<sub>1-436</sub>* was obtained at pH 7.5, rather than at an acidic pH. Recently, the structures of trimeric pre-fusion RABV-G in complex with neutralizing antibodies have been determined by cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we first prepared the G ecto-domain proteins of different lyssaviruses from all the three phylogenetic groups by the fusion-loop substitution strategy developed before [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Crystal structures of Ikoma lyssavirus G (IKOV-G) and MOKV-G were solved at pH-8.3 and pH-4.0, respectively. For IKOV-G crystallized at pH-8.3, the structure showed a bended conformation and a trimeric architecture resembling those observed in the Cryo-EM pre-fusion RABV-G structures, highlighting a similar trimeric pre-fusion architecture shared by lyssavirus G. For MOKV-G crystallized at pH-4.0, the structure exhibited a linear conformation similar to the previously reported MOKV-G<sub>1-436</sub>* structure solved at pH-7.5 [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] but was clearly much more extended than the latter, therefore featuring, in our opinion, as a more typical post-fusion configuration. Guided by the structures, we proposed a detailed spatial-temporal structure-transition model for lyssavirus G along with pH-decrease, which was further corroborated by the mutagenic analyses. Finally, we also observed an interesting low-pH-induced binding of the C-terminal region (CTR) of the G ectodomain with PHD-FD, which should also facilitate the pH-dependent structural transition of lyssavirus G. These structural and functional data will shed light on the mechanism of lyssavirus entry mediated by G and should be able to support vaccine and drug design.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>A universal strategy for preparing well-behaved lyssavirus G ectodomain protein</title><p>The <italic toggle="yes">Lyssavirus</italic> genus encompasses 17 virus species which have been subdivided into three phylogroups (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).

In the crystallographic asymmetric unit, a total of six IKOV-G molecules, which are of essentially the same structure, are observed to assemble into two IKOV-G trimers. Because each protomer showed a similar topological structure to RABV-G [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we therefore termed the individual domains and the secondary structural elements of IKOV-G accordingly as in the RABV-G structure reported in our previous work [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Although a certain portion of the FD domain remains untraceable because of poor electron densities, the majority of the IKOV-G residues are clearly visualized in the electron density map. Overall, the solved structure clearly shows a bended hairpin conformation. In comparison to the previously reported structure of RABV-G in the early-intermediate state, however, a remarkable difference was observed in the location of the helix F element and the following CTR. Rather than forming a single elongated helix F and extending out from FD in the intermediate conformation, the residues L380-H384 of IKOV-G adopt a loop conformation, resulting helix F into two short helices (F1 and F2) connected via an inter-helix loop (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">Figs 2A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1012923.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A</xref>). The F1 helix stretches out and resembles its equivalent part of RABV-G (early-intermediate). The inter-loop and helix F2, however, turn back to facilitate the following CTR loop being trapped in a surface groove on FD (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).

Specifically, the nitrogen atom in imidazole group of residue H397 makes an H-bond with the side-chain -OH group of T60, representing a key factor of the CTR-FD interactions. Additionally, the side-chain of W395 also makes an H-bond with the main-chain of P137. Furthermore, a cluster of residues, comprising H86, L135, V153, N172, H173, W395, L399, Y402 and T412, are observed to converge together to provide hydrophobic interactions.

Within the trimeric architecture, three protomers are converged together via the CD domain (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), with three C-helices almost juxtaposed to each other to form an inverse frustum-cone with top and bottom radii of about 10.5 &#x000c5; and 6 &#x000c5;, respectively (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). It seems to be a rather loosened assembling mode. Among the juxtaposed C-helices, only few residues (eg. E289) locating at the cone bottom are observed to make inter-helix contacts via their side-chains. Instead, most inter-protomeric interactions arise from the contacts between helix C in one protomer and helix D and the F1-interloop-F2 element in the neighboring protomer (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). The trimeric-interface is mainly supported by a cluster of salt-bridge interactions and H-bonds. Specifically, residues E281, D285, E288 and R280 in helix C, are observed to form a salt-bridge and H-bond network with residues R299, S378, K300, S297, D383 and L381 locating at the helix D, helix F1 and helix F2 of the neighboring protomer (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). In addition, the inter-protomer binding is further corroborated by a small number of apolar and van der Waals (vdw) contacts, mainly involving residues I277, L284, E289 and L292 in one protomer with L381, L388 and R390 in the neighboring protomer (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).</p><p>The pre-fusion structure of VSV-G has also been determined as a trimeric architecture assembled around the three central helices (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Forming an obvious contrast to those observed in the IKOV-G trimer, however, the three helices are packed in a more compact manner, arranging into a frustum-cone with a top-radius of about 5 &#x000c5; and a bottom-radius of about 8.5 &#x000c5;. Accordingly, the three protomers in the VSV-G trimer are more intimately stacked against each other, which are stabilized by hydrophobic and vdw contacts among three central helixes (involving residues L279, L283, E286 and L384) and the intimate interactions between mainly the central helix in one protomer and the structural elements equivalent to IKOV-G&#x02019;s helix D and F1-interloop-F2 in the neighboring protomer (involving H22-P25, T265, R277, Y281 in one protomer and amino acids L384, I387, H389-L392, H397 in the other protomer) (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>).</p><p>In comparison to the previously reported structures of pre-fusion RABV-G determined by Cryo-EM [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], IKOV-G exhibits a similar trimeric architecture (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>).

Helix F1 is unfolded as a preceding loop, orienting back towards the PHD and FD domains. This allows the F2 helix to be arranged in parallel to helix C (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g003" ref-type="fig">Figs 3A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1012923.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B</xref>). Consequently, the CTR loop is shown to extend over domains PHD and FD, enabling multiple amino acid interactions between CTR and PHD-FD along the interface.

Of note, an equivalent salt-bridge interaction has also been observed in VSV-G (formed by D137 and H407), and H407 has been identified as a key player in structural transition [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Consequently, we generated four mutants of RABV-G (D143A, D143N, H397A, and D143A/H397A) and analyzed their capacities to induce syncytia formation in parallel with the wild-type (WT) glycoprotein. In BHK-21 cells, WT, D143A and D143N mutant glycoproteins are all efficiently expressed and properly transported to the cell surface (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Using flow cytometry, we further showed that WT, D143A and D143N mutant glycoproteins featured with similar levels of cell surface location (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). For mutations of H397A and D143A/H397A, however, the H397A mutant and to a lesser extent the D143A/H397A mutant were less transported than WT G to the surface. Furthermore, the H397A mutant were also observed to be accumulated more in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1012923.g003" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). These observations coincided well with the corresponding mutant in VSV G (the H407A mutant) which was also shown to be less transported to cell surface [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Regarding the syncytium-formation, the results showed that single mutation of D143A and double mutation of D143A/H397A could completely abolish the G-mediated cell-cell fusion (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). For the D143N (which would abolish the salt bridge with H397 but likely still allow for H-bonds) and H397A mutants, the formation of cell-syncytia was also clearly inhibited, with a dramatic decrease in both the fusion-cell numbers and the syncytium size (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). These results demonstrated that disruption of the D143/H397 interactions could severely impact, even completely block, G-mediated membrane fusion, which in turn highlighted the indispensable role of the CTR/PHD-FD interactions in lyssavirus G activity.</p><p>We also compared our MOKV-G structure with a previously reported structure of MOKV-G<sub>1-436</sub>* (PDB code: 6TMR), which also showed an elongated architecture [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. When the two structures were superimposed based on the CD domain, we observed a large domain-orientation difference (by ~27.5&#x000b0;) for FD. Resultantly, our structure displayed apparently a much more extended linear-conformation than the MOKV-G<sub>1-436</sub>* structure (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). We further aligned the two MOKV-G structures to the trimeric post-fusion structure of VSV-G (PDB code: 5I2M). As expected, our MOKV-G structure, with a much more extended conformation, could be well modeled into the post-fusion VSV-G trimer architecture.

The element-1 is qC-linker (the loop linking strand q to helix C). In the basic-pH structures of IKOV-G and RABV-G (PDB code: 6LGX), this interloop is of high flexibility such that a number of the loop residues are density-untraceable (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1012923.g004" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). In the acidic-pH structures of MOKV-G and RABV-G (PDB code: 6LGW), however, part of the loop is refolded into a helical structure, assembling into helix C-extension (an extension to helix C).

In the IKOV-G structure, the F1/F2 interloop remains a loop conformation, whose flexibility enables the FD domain to contact the CTR loop of the molecule. In the RABV-G structure (PDB code: 6LGX), this inter-helix loop refolds into a helical structure, uniting the F1 and F2 helices into a single long helix F. Resultantly, the FD domain and the CTR, as observed in the RABV-G structure at early-intermediated state, are separated from each other. As shown in the RABV-G structure (PDB code: 6LGW) at late-intermediated state, a kink appeared in the F helix. The relative rigidity of helices, however, makes domain FD remain distant from the CTR loop. Finally, at post-fusion state as observed in the MOKV-G structure, the F1 helix dis-assembled into a loop, allowing FD to be in the proximity to the CTR again (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1012923.g004" ref-type="fig">4C</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1012923.g004" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>).

We therefore set out to investigate if PHD-FD might interact with CTR in a pH-dependent mode. The PHD-FD domain protein (designated as G-PHD-FD) and the CTR loop protein (designated as G-CTR) derived from RABV-G were individually prepared to homogeneity (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). The circular dichroism (CD) profile of G-PHD-FD featured with clear negative peaks at ~208&#x02009;nm and ~217&#x02009;nm, respectively. Analyses of the spectra using BeStSel (<ext-link xlink:href="https://bestsel.elte.hu/index.php" ext-link-type="uri">https://bestsel.elte.hu/index.php</ext-link>) revealed mixed secondary structural elements for the protein composed of low content of &#x003b1;-helices and high content of &#x003b2;-strands, coinciding well with the expected structure. We also performed the CD experiments at different pHs, which revealed quite similar and consistent spectrum profiles along pH-decrease (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Furthermore, we selected three PHD-specific antibodies (NM57, SOJB and RVC20) [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and performed the antibody-binding test with G-PHD-FD using ELISA. As expected, our protein can be effectively recognized by all the three antibodies (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). These results indicated the proper protein folding of G-PHD-FD. Consequently, the real-time interactions between G-PHD-FD and G-CTR were then characterized at different pHs via surface plasmon resonance (SPR). At pH 7.5, only negligible binding was observed (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). When pH decreased to 6.5, we observed clear interactions between G-PHD-FD and G-CTR (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). The affinity, however, was estimated to be &#x0003e;150 &#x003bc;M, representing a weak binding at pH 6.5.

However, in the context of the complete G, when the two fragments are linked within the same protomer, the interaction may be much more stable.

Intriguingly, we have obtained a crystal structure of IKOV-G displaying a trimeric pre-fusion architecture. In comparison to that observed in the pre-fusion trimer-structure of VSV-G, the trimerization-arrangement for IKOV-G is rather loosened and should therefore be of less stability (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Echoing these observations, previous studies have shown that RABV-G trimer is not as stable as VSV-G and can be easily disrupted using detergents [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It is also notable that two recent studies have reported the Cryo-EM structure of RABV-G in complex with pre-fusion-trimer stabilized antibodies [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The work has revealed the structural features of trimerized RABV-G in the pre-fusion state. The IKOV-G structure determined in our study presents a very similar architecture to that of the pre-fusion RABV-G trimer (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). Noted that IKOV-G and RABV-G possess the lowest sequence identity in the <italic toggle="yes">Lyssavirus</italic> genus, we would therefore suggest that other lyssavirus G, which all has a higher sequence identity to RABV-G, shares a resembled pre-fusion trimer structure [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>We also pay attention to the potential inter-molecule interactions between neighboring trimers in our IKOV-G structure. Though numerous inter-molecule contacts could be observed, they are not shown to directly affect the protomer assembly within the trimer. In addition, comparison our IKOV-G structure with previously reported pre-fusion-trimer structures of RABV-G solved by Cryo-EM (which would not subject to crystal packing effects) reveals quite similar trimer formation patterns. Thus, we believe that the trimeric architecture observed in our structure, which is quite different from that observed in the VSV-G structure, is unlikely due to crystal packing but a reflection of variant protomer-assembly mode between lyssaviruses and vesiculoviruses.</p><p>During lyssavirus entry, membrane fusion is accompanied with the low-pH induced structural transitions in G [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is interesting that the IKOV-G and MOKV-G structures solved in this study, as well as the two RABV-G structures reported previously [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], are derived at different pHs. When the four G-structures were aligned in a pH-descending manner, we observed a series of sequential element-refolding events, which coincide well with the fusion process (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g004" ref-type="fig">Figs 4</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1012923.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>).</p><p>Step-1. With an overall bended hairpin conformation, the pre-fusion lyssavirus G is further featured with a relative short helix C and a flexible loop following the helix, as well as a helix-loop-helix structure for the helix F element. Such structural features would enable helix F1, the F1/F2 inter loop and helix F2 to establish extensive contacts with helix C of the neighboring protomers, stabilizing the pre-fusion trimeric architecture (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g002" ref-type="fig">Figs 2C</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1012923.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). Nevertheless, lyssavirus G assembles into pre-fusion trimers in a rather loosened manner. In addition, the interactions between FD and CTR are overall negligible at basic- or neutral-pH (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Resultantly, the pre-fusion trimer of lyssavirus G is easily disrupted and would equilibrate with G in the early-intermediate state at step-2. In support of this, there have been studies showing that glycoprotein on the rhabdovirus surface is actually polymorphic in the neutral environment such that the G trimers and monomers could both be observed [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Step-2. Lyssavirus G undergoes de-trimerization due to the instability of its pre-fusion architecture and/or the decrease of the environmental pH (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). The absence of constraints from neighboring protomers enables the F1-interloop-F2 element to re-unit into a single helix (helix F), sufficing lyssavirus G for domain re-arrangements in the next stage. While G remains a bended hairpin conformation, the early-intermediate structure likely has snapshot the protein in a state when the fusion loops are partially exposed (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g004" ref-type="fig">Figs 4</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1012923.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>).</p><p>Step-3. Further decrease of pH will cause large domain-rearrangements in G, leading to an extended linear conformation for the protein. Concomitantly, part of qC-linker will refold into a helical structure as an extension of helix C (or helix C-extension), preparing for the subsequent interactions with helix F in the next stage (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g004" ref-type="fig">Figs 4</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1012923.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). Furthermore, a kink occurs in the F helix, featuring the start of the helix dis-assembly for the F1 region. The FD domain and the protein CTR are positioned almost on the opposite sides at this stage, thereby enabling the full exposure of the fusion loops for insertion into the target membranes (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g004" ref-type="fig">Figs 4</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1012923.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>).</p><p>Step-4. Proceeding into post-fusion stage, helix F1 will be completely unfolded into a loop, enabling helix F2 to be aligned in parallel with and thereby to interact with helix C-extension (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g004" ref-type="fig">Figs 4</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1012923.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). Furthermore, the low environment-pH will also significantly increase the interactions between PHD-FD and CTR (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Subsequently, CTR is locked to PHD-FD, dragging the viral envelope and the cell membrane into close proximity where fusion occurs. This represents the final stage of the structural transitions (<xref rid="ppat.1012923.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the structures have featured a multi-step spatial-temporal transition model for lyssavirus G in response to low-pH during membrane fusion. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the proposed model is based on the static structures reported thus far. It cannot be ruled out that some missing intermediates are revealed in the future. In addition, a post-fusion-trimer structure for RABV-G or any other lyssavirus G remain unresolved. Though structure of MOKV-G obtained in our study is conformationally similar to the protomer structures of CHAV and VSV G in the trimeric post-fusion state [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the MOKV-G molecule in our structure do not assemble into trimeric architectures. In such a context, the current structural transition model presumably still has limitations and might be optimized based on new lyssavirus G structures, which should be explored in the future.</p><p>Finally, a total of 17 viral species have been identified within the <italic toggle="yes">Lyssavirus</italic> genus [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Apart from RABV, the other 16 lyssaviruses can also cause fatal encephalitis resembling rabies. Currently, there is no vaccines available against non-RABV lyssaviruses. The inactivated vaccines against RABV are well-developed but with high cost, preventing widespread use in low-income countries. It is thus necessary to develop safe, effective and affordable subunit vaccines against RABV and non-RABV lyssaviruses. In this study, we successfully obtained well-behaved proteins of lyssaviruses G-ecto from all the three phylogenetic groups via the fusion-loop substitution strategy developed previously [<xref rid="ppat.1012923.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We believe the strategy for preparing lyssavirus G, which could act as vaccination immunogens, will pave the way for development of subunit vaccines against lyssaviruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Sf9 (<italic toggle="yes">Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>; Invitrogen 11496015) and Hi5 (<italic toggle="yes">Trichoplusia ni;</italic> Invitrogen B85502) cells were individually maintained in the SIM SF medium and the SIM HF medium (Sino Biological) using a non-humidified shaker at 27&#x000b0;C.
