This study aimed to investigate whether trajectory profiles of alcohol consumption across adulthood were associated with risk of first primary malignant BC in postmenopausal women. At baseline, 28,720 pre-and postmenopausal women aged 50&#x02013;65 years from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Cohort reported their average alcohol intake over the past 12 months and their average alcohol intake at the ages of 20, 30, 40, and 50 years. Alcohol consumption trajectories were estimated using latent class mixed models. BC cases were identified through record linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. To examine associations between alcohol consumption trajectories and BC, we fitted a proportional hazard model adjusted for potential confounding factors using data from 24,543 postmenopausal women without missing covariate information. We identified 4 alcohol consumption trajectory profiles. During a median follow-up of 16.5 years, 1,591 cases of BC occurred. A mean alcohol consumption trajectory of &#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;g/day was associated with higher risk of BC (HR: 1.65, 95%CI: 1.35&#x02013;2.03) compared to a mean alcohol consumption trajectory of &#x0003c;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;g/day. We found no association between trajectory profiles characterized by lower alcohol intakes in early adulthood followed by increasing consumption of alcohol in adulthood compared to a consistently low intake of alcohol. Postmenopausal women drinking consistently high amounts of alcohol throughout adulthood had a higher risk of BC compared to women with a consistently low intake of alcohol.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10654-024-01179-5.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Alcohol consumption</kwd><kwd>Latent class mixed models</kwd><kwd>Diet</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Health cohort</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Aarhus Universitet</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by Aarhus Universitet</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Pietro Paolo Sanna 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">According to the latest GLOBOCAN estimates of cancer incidence and mortality, female breast cancer (BC) accounted for more than 2.0&#x000a0;million incident cases in 2022 [1], making it the second most diagnosed cancer disease with the incidence rate of BC currently increasing among younger women (&#x0003c;&#x02009;50 years) in many parts of the world [2]. Consumption of alcoholic beverages is an established risk factor for BC, and alcohol consumption was in 2020 estimated to account for 98.300 new BC cases globally (95% uncertainty intervals: 68.200,130.500) [3&#x02013;5]. However, the established evidence associating alcohol consumption with risk of BC is almost exclusively based on studies considering only single measures of the women&#x02019;s alcohol intake [6]. A limitation to such approaches is the inability to capture variations in drinking behavior over the course of adulthood which may play a role in relation to future disease risk. In a UK based study focusing on life course alcohol consumption trajectories using data from 9 cohorts with at least three measurement of the participants&#x02019; alcohol intake including approximately 59,400men and women, mean consumption of alcohol among women increased considerably during adolescence followed by stable intake in mid-adulthood and a continuous declining intake throughout late-adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As alcohol intake changes over time, it is important to capture variations in alcohol intake when investigating associations between alcohol consumption and risk of various health outcomes. Alcohol intake patterns among women vary not only over time but also between cultures. To date, associations between alcohol trajectories during adulthood and risk of BC have been investigated in an Australian prospective cohort study and in a Spanish population-based case-control study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While these studies represent different alcohol consumption cultures, more research in different populations and time periods is needed to gain insight into the potential importance of consumption patterns over time for BC risk. Additionally, both studies employed group-based trajectory models (GBTM) to identify patterns of alcohol consumption over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A GBTM is a finite mixture model commonly used to identify subgroups of participants characterized by similar exposure profiles and to summarize variability of predictors over time in longitudinal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the model may not take the intra-individual correlation between multiple alcohol records from the same woman into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In contrast, latent class mixed models (LCMM) combine GBTM with mixed models to account for intra-individual correlation, and were recently used to identify alcohol consumption trajectories during adulthood and relate them to risk of colorectal cancer in a large European cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the current study, we aimed to investigate alcohol consumption trajectories and risk of BC by using repeated measurements of alcohol intakes from 28,720 female participants in the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort. We identified and characterized alcohol consumption trajectories across adulthood using LCMM. Furthermore, we estimated the association between trajectory profiles of alcohol consumption and the risk of first primary malignant BC in postmenopausal women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cohort characteristics and study population</title><p id="Par6">Between 1993 and 1997, 160,727 men and women were invited to participate in the Danish prospective cohort study &#x0201c;Diet, Cancer and Health (DCH)&#x0201d; in which 57,053 participants were included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To be eligible for inclusion, participants had to be born in Denmark, live in the Copenhagen or Aarhus areas and with no previous cancer diagnosis registered in the Danish Cancer Registry.

Using a lifestyle questionnaire, the participants were also asked to retrospectively report their average intakes of alcohol at four periods of their lives (at the ages of 20, 30, 40, 50 years) to reflect lifetime intakes of alcohol. See Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for the number of women with available information about their alcohol intake at the different ages. The participants reported their intake in 12 categories ranging from &#x0201c;never&#x0201d; to &#x02265;&#x02009;8 times per day. In terms of their alcohol consumption, the participants reported their average frequency of consumption of beer (3 types, in bottles of 330&#x000a0;ml), wine in standard glassed (125&#x000a0;ml), fortified wine used for drinks (glassed of 60&#x000a0;ml) and spirits used for drinks (30&#x000a0;ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

Menopausal status was determined at baseline and according to various information about the women&#x02019;s menstrual history as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Women were categorised as postmenopausal if they had no periods of menses during the preceding 12 months from baseline or had undergone surgically induced menopause due to a bilateral ovariectomy. Women with no information about their menstruation history, women who reported having undergone a hysterectomy surgery or exogenous hormones use were characterised as postmenopausal if they were &#x02265;55 years.

Women aged 46&#x02013;55 years old were categorised as perimenopausal if information about their menstruation history was missing or they stated exogenous hormone use or having undergone a hysterectomy.

First, we identified subgroups of women with distinct alcohol consumption patterns across adulthood using LCMM.

All measurements of the participants&#x02019; alcohol intakes were log-transformed (log(x&#x02009;+&#x02009;1)) to account for their non-normal distribution. We modelled the trajectories as a function of participants&#x02019; age (rescaled and recentred: (age-35/13)) assuming a quadratic time trend both at the population level and at the individual level with random effects to account for the intra-individual correlation between the alcohol measurements of the same woman. We used a quadratic time function determined based on visual inspection of 100 randomly selected women&#x02019;s individual trajectories of alcohol consumption. The LCMM models were estimated within the maximum likelihood framework for a varying number of latent classes ranging from 1 to 6. To prevent convergence towards a local suboptimal maximum and to fully explore the parameter space, we ran the estimation procedure from 100 vectors of random initial parameter values based on the model parameters of the 1-class trajectory model. Furthermore, for the 5 and 6-class models, respectively, we manually specified initial values based on the model parameters obtained from models with a lower number of latent classes. We determined the most appropriate number of latent classes according to several statistical criteria: the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), entropy, the Integrated Classification Likelihood Criterion (ICL) and the posterior probability classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, we did not retain latent classes considered too small (&#x0003c;5% of the participants) as the number of BC cases within each class would be too limited for further analysis (see the <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">supplementary method</xref> for a detailed description of the criteria). To further evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the selected model, we plotted the weighted-subject specific predicted trajectories against the weighted mean observed trajectories. After determination of the final latent class model, each woman was assigned to the trajectory class to which they had the highest posterior probability of belonging given their measures of alcohol intakes for the purpose of using standard summary statistics to describe baseline socio-demographic, lifestyle, and reproductive characteristics of the women according to the assigned latent class.

The time to diagnosis of first primary malignant BC was right censored by death, emigration, or loss to follow-up, which ever came first. We maximized the joint likelihood by keeping the parameters of the LCMM fixed while estimating the parameters of the hazard model. This allowed us to model the risk of BC according to the true latent class structure while properly accounting for the inherent classification error in the posterior assignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We fitted two parametric survival models with proportional hazards across classes. One model assuming a Weibull baseline hazard function and a second model approximating the baseline hazard by a cubic M-splines with 5 and 4 knots, respectively and compared the models according to the AIC. According to the AIC, we selected the more flexible hazard specific model with cubic M-splines with 4 knots and modelled the instantaneous risk of BC according to participant age. The estimated procedure accounted for delayed entry. We used two levels of adjustment for potential confounding factors. In Model 1, we adjusted for participant age (underlying timescale) and baseline date of recruitment into the cohort (in quintiles). In Model 2, we further adjusted for the following lifestyle and reproductive factors: physical activity level (inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, active), smoking status (current smoker, former smoker, never smoker), educational level (primary, technical/professional school, secondary school, higher education), BMI (&#x0003c;18.5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 18.5&#x02013;24.9&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 25-&#x0003c;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, &#x02265;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), age at first full term pregnancy (no full-term pregnancy, &#x02264;&#x02009;21, 21&#x02013;30, &#x0003e;30 years), age at menarche (&#x02264;12, 12&#x02013;14, &#x0003e;14 years), breast feeding (yes, no), and ever use hormonal replacement therapy (yes, no).

The remaining women (15.1%) had a mean alcohol consumption trajectory characterised by a continuously high alcohol intake across adulthood (Class 2) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Compared to the total cohort of postmenopausal women, women who belonged to class 4 (continuously low intake of alcohol across adulthood) were more likely to have higher age at baseline and tended to have a lower average lifetime intake of alcohol, while women belonging to Class 2 (consistently high alcohol intake) tended to have a higher average lifetime alcohol intake (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Furthermore, women in Class 4 were less likely to have a higher education compared to the total cohort, while those with consistently high intakes of alcohol (Class 2) were more likely to have a higher educational level. Furthermore, women in class 4 with a consistently low alcohol intake were less likely to have used hormonal replacement therapy and to be above age 26 when they had their first full term pregnancy compared to the total cohort. However, women of Class 2 were more likely to be age&#x02009;&#x0003e;26 at their first full term pregnancy compared to the total cohort. Women in Class 4 were more likely to be never smokers, physically inactive, to be &#x0003e;14 years old when they had their first menstrual bleeding, and to have a BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

We found no evidence of associations between the remaining alcohol consumption trajectories and risk of BC when compared to women with a mean alcohol consumption trajectory characterized by a consistently low intake of alcohol.</p><sec id="Sec224"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par22">This study had a large study population with a large number of cases, a long follow-up time, minimal loss to follow-up and detailed and repeated information on women&#x02019;s alcohol intakes across adulthood. Therefore, we were able to investigate associations between exposure to alcohol and risk of BC while simultaneously capturing the variation in drinking behavior across adulthood. In contrast to the few existing studies on associations between alcohol consumption trajectories and risk of BC, we fitted a LCMM instead of a GBTM, which is a commonly used approach in epidemiologic studies conducting trajectory analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Although GBTM and LCMM rely on the same core assumptions, the LCMM captures within-class variation by introducing subject-specific random effects to the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Heterogeneity across women with similar trajectory profiles is not accounted for in the GBTM approach as that model assumes that individual trajectories remain homogeneous within each latent class. The validity of such an assumption may be questionable in many applications with several exposure measurements of the same study participant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, we acknowledge that the LCMM is a more complicated model that can result in convergence issues, including computational constraints in very large sets of data. Thus, both modelling approaches can provide important insights interpreted in the light of their underlying assumptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, irrespective of the latent class trajectory modelling approach employed, the posterior assignment of participants is subject to classification error and does not reflect the true underlying latent class structure, leading to incorrect inference if used directly as exposure variable in a regression model. This is especially an issue when the discriminatory power of the latent class model is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In this study, we accounted for the uncertainty related to the class membership assignment in the proportional hazard models by adopting a modelling approach that accounted for the classification error in the exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In this study, the ascertainment of cancer cases during follow-up was conducted through record linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry, which minimize the risk of selection bias due to loss to follow-up. Moreover, only 162 women did not report their alcohol intake at the ages of 20, 30, 40 and 50 years and the measurements of these women&#x02019;s alcohol intake at the specific timepoints were not included in the LCMM estimation (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Hence, the small number of missing observations are unlikely to have resulted in substantial bias. This study is also prone to limitations. Data on the women&#x02019;s alcohol intake was self-reported, and retrospectively collected, therefore, likely subject to measurement errors. In the context of alcohol consumption, this may have resulted in under-reporting of alcohol intake during adulthood especially among heavy consumers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, we cannot rule out systematic errors of the exposure. However, due to the prospective nature of the study, measurement errors would be non-differential with respect to BC occurrence. Furthermore, random measurement errors were accounted for in the LCMM under the assumption that they were homoscedastic and non-differential. While the baseline the FFQ was validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], no gold standard to assess the validity of alcohol intake measurements during early to mid-adulthood is available. In the study, women who abstained from alcohol were included in trajectory estimation. These women were probably assigned to the latent class of women with a consistently low intake of alcohol, which was used as the reference group in the proportional hazard model. An unknown proportion of these women may abstain from alcohol due to health-related issues associated with their risk of BC. Grouping these women with women with a consistently low intake of alcohol may raise the baseline rate of BC in the reference group, thus leading to diminished contrast to the other classes. Furthermore, as menopausal status was determined at baseline at not at BC diagnosis, which is more relevant in an etiological context, we considered perimenopausal women as being post-menopausal based on the assumption that these women would have entered menopause at time of diagnosis or at the end of follow-up. However, we cannot rule out that some of these women were not post-menopausal resulting in misclassification of menopausal status. Finally, although we adjusted the analyses for several potential confounding variables, we cannot rule out that residual confounding may have impacted the results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p id="Par23">In 2018, the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) reported a higher risk of BC of 9% per 10&#x000a0;g/day intake of alcohol among post-menopausal women in their dose-response meta-analysis of 22 studies (RR: 1.09, 95%CI: 1.07,1.12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite this large body of evidence, only few studies have investigated associations between alcohol consumption trajectories and risk of BC. In a Spanish study of 1,017 case-control pairs, using a GBTM approach, the authors identified 4 distinct alcohol consumption profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Similar to the trajectories observed here, the authors identified one trajectory of women with a trajectory profile of consistently low alcohol intake but with a slightly lower mean intake (&#x0003c;5&#x000a0;g/day vs. &#x0003c;6&#x000a0;g(day). Furthermore, the authors identified a second trajectory profile of women characterized by a low alcohol intake in adolescence (&#x0003c;5&#x000a0;g/day) with a moderate intake throughout adulthood (5-&#x0003c;15&#x000a0;g/day), which is similar to our classes 1 and 3. Compared to consistently low alcohol intakes, no associations with BC were found (OR: 1.22, 95%CI: 0.83,1.79) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which are similar to our results for classes 1 and 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Similarly, a prospective cohort study of 22,767 pre- and post-menopausal women in which 3 alcohol trajectories were identified using a GBTM found no higher risk of BC (HR: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.84,1.06) when comparing a trajectory characterized by a stable low intake of alcohol through adulthood (approx. 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;g/day) to lifetime abstainers (&#x0003c;2.2&#x000a0;g/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the Spanish case-control study a moderate alcohol intake (5-&#x0003c;15&#x000a0;g/day) from adolescence to youth that decreased throughout adulthood was associated with higher odds of BC (OR: 1.79, (95%Cl: 1.02, 3.15) among postmenopausal women compared to consistently low intake. This could indicate that a relatively high alcohol intake early in life followed by a lower alcohol intake throughout adulthood bears an impact on BC risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Associations between alcohol consumption in youth and early adulthood and risk of BC have been reported previously although results are inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. On the other hand, all three trajectory studies to date, including our own, have observed that consistently high alcohol consumption patterns across adulthood were associated with risk of BC, whether compared to either lifetime abstainers or consistently low intakes in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This indicates that a mean alcohol consumption pattern of more than 5&#x000a0;g/day from adolescence and across adulthood may play a profound role in relation to risk of BC irrespective of fluctuations in alcohol consumption during the remaining part of life.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par24">Adopting a latent class mixed modelling approach to estimate alcohol consumption trajectories, we identified four distinct patterns of alcohol consumption behavior. The results of this study suggest that post-menopausal women who have an alcohol consumption trajectory characterized by a continuously high consumption of alcohol throughout adulthood have a higher risk of developing first primary malignant BC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
