The survey was completed anonymously on an opt-in basis and 28 responses that met our criteria for analysis were collected. Qualitative data from free-text responses were grouped under themes and quantitative data was analysed using SPSS.</p></sec><sec id="sec9560"><title>Results</title><p>Despite 64% (n=18) of respondents indicating that their disability increased their vulnerability to COVID-19 in some capacity, the effect of the pandemic on accessibility was not statistically significant. This could be due to the small response number, or the everyday limitations participants faced prior to the pandemic. 92% (n=25) of participants indicated that there was great inclusion in the watersports activities and that they were &#x0201c;very beneficial&#x0201d; regarding the possibility of the whole family&#x02019;s participation [p=0.005]. The survey also found a statistically significant association between the event&#x02019;s activities being considered both &#x0201c;accessible&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;very beneficial&#x0201d; in terms of boosting self-confidence, with 57.1% of responses indicating agreement to this.

Programmes should be established that allow able-bodied siblings and young people with disabilities to participate in the same activities.</p></sec><sec id="sec9562"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
