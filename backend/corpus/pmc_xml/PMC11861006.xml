Symptoms of pelvic floor disorders and sexual dysfunction secondary to systemic cancer treatment may occur. Non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical conservative therapies, namely pelvic floor muscle (PFM) and education-based therapies, could be beneficial to reduce these symptoms in this population. This systematic review aimed to examine the evidence regarding their effectiveness on bladder, bowel, vaginal, sexual, psychological function, quality of life, and PFM function in breast cancer populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Recent findings</title><p id="Par2">Six databases were searched to identify interventional studies on the effect of PFM therapies, education-based therapies, or combined (multimodal) therapies on any outcome of interest. The search yielded 603 results, from which 12 studies were included. Of these, six (50%) were RCTs, one (8%) was a non-RCT with two groups, and five (42%) were non-RCTs with a single group. Findings suggest that PFM therapies (active) may be beneficial, and education in the format of CBT may improve bladder function. No data were found for bowel function and results from two RCTs were inconclusive to draw conclusions for vaginal function. Sexual function was the most frequently reported outcome. PFM therapies (active&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;passive) may be beneficial, and education is more likely than not to improve sexual function. For psychological function, PFM therapies (active&#x02009;+&#x02009;passive) may be beneficial, and education is more unlikely than likely to improve psychological function. For quality of life, PFM therapies (active&#x02009;+&#x02009;passive) may be beneficial, and education is more unlikely than likely to improve quality of life, although CBT combined with physical exercise may provide further improvement. PFM therapies (active&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;passive) may improve PFM function. Given the limited number of studies and their methodological limitations, caution should be exercised when interpreting these study results. More research is needed to confirm findings and to investigate the clinical value of PFM therapies and combined, multimodal therapies for breast cancer populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p id="Par3">Non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical conservative therapies may be helpful for breast cancer populations. Clinicians should consider the highest level of available evidence to guide their practice and use their clinical judgement to select the treatment components and appropriate dosages.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11912-024-01633-3.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Conservative treatment</kwd><kwd>Education</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Pelvic floor</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Women&#x02019;s health</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of Melbourne</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">Breast malignancy is the most common cancer, accounting for 24&#x02013;25% of cancer cases in females, with nearly 2.3 million of new cases annually worldwide&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Symptoms of pelvic floor disorders are prevalent in this population, with a prevalence of 38% for urinary incontinence and 18% for fecal incontinence&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Symptoms of sexual dysfunction are also common, with a prevalence reaching up to 70%&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Breast cancer treatment generally consists of surgery, radiotherapy, systemic therapy (e.g., endocrine therapy or chemotherapy), or a combination of these. Endocrine therapy and chemotherapy have been proposed to induce indirect changes in pelvic floor tissues by hormonal suppression or failure&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These changes could contribute to the onset of new or the aggravation of preexisting symptoms of pelvic floor disorders and sexual dysfunction. Furthermore, there are reports of increased burden of hypoestrogenic side effects in females after breast cancer treatment compared to those who undergo natural menopause, due to the rapidity and severity of symptom onset following iatrogenic menopause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training has been suggested to increase blood flow and improve PFM function&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which could mitigate the adverse effects of systemic breast cancer treatment, including symptoms of pelvic floor disorders and sexual dysfunction. A recent systematic review on conservative therapies in gynecological cancer populations concluded that combined, multimodal therapies, i.e., PFM therapies in conjunction with education-based therapies, can be effective in improving vaginal, overall pelvic floor, sexual, and PFM function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These conclusions may not be generalizable to breast cancer populations as the underlying mechanisms of symptoms of pelvic floor disorders or sexual dysfunction differ between both populations. Gynecological cancer populations, for instance, may undergo pelvic surgery or radiation therapy. No study has systematically and comprehensively reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of PFM and education-based therapies in breast cancer populations. Given that the effects of conservative therapies may extend beyond the target tissue or psychosocial domain that was the focus of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], examining the evidence of the effectiveness of PFM and education-based therapies across a wide spectrum of outcomes that affect breast cancer females is critical to inform future research directions and clinical practice.</p><p id="Par6">The objective of this systematic review was to examine the evidence regarding the effectiveness of non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical conservative therapies, namely PFM and education-based therapies, on bladder, bowel, vaginal, sexual, psychological function, quality of life, and PFM function in breast cancer populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>General Methodology and Search Strategy</title><p id="Par7">This systematic review adhered to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) Reporting Guideline&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Informed by one prior review&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and in collaboration with a medical librarian, we created a search strategy based on PICO eligibility criteria. We searched six databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Emcare) from their respective inception dates to December&#x000a0;2023, without imposing restrictions on publication dates. The search aimed to identify studies of PFM and education-based therapies in breast cancer populations.

Following the PICOT approach (P:&#x000a0;population, I:&#x000a0;intervention, C:&#x000a0;comparison, O:&#x000a0;outcome, T: time frame; timing of delivery), the eligibility criteria were: (P) at least 75% of the participants were adult females (aged&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years) who had either been diagnosed with or undergone any treatment for breast cancer, i.e., ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer, or a majority of participants were adult females who had been diagnosed with or undergone any treatment for any type of breast cancer; (I) to be grouped as: a) &#x02018;PFM therapies&#x02019;; b) &#x02018;education-based therapies&#x02019;, or c) &#x02018;combined therapies&#x02019;. &#x02018;PFM therapies&#x02019; include non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical interventions that target the pelvic floor soft tissues (e.g., performance of voluntary activation and relaxation of PFM, electrical or magnetic stimulation, manual therapy, dilator therapy, or desensitization techniques). &#x02018;Education-based therapies&#x02019; include non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical interventions that target cognitive aspects related to the pelvic floor. Therapies had to have a plausible explanation that they could indirectly influence the function of the pelvic floor (i.e., bladder, bowel, vaginal, or muscle function). Counselling, psychoeducation, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or mindfulness-based therapy, etc. were eligible if they provided information about the pelvic floor structure, function, or exercise; addressed emotional, psychological, behavioral, or sexual aspects related to the cancer or cancer treatment repercussions, e.g., advice for vaginal lubricant, moisturizer, or body scanning. &#x02018;Combined therapies&#x02019; refers to any intervention combining these two types of therapies. If any other treatment components were part of the intervention, they were included (e.g., general exercise) unless a pharmaceutical ingredient or laser therapy was used. Interventions were considered for eligibility regardless of the setting (e.g., individual or group, in person or remotely) or healthcare provider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; (C) with or without any type of comparator group; (O) any outcome related to bladder, bowel, vaginal, sexual, psychological function, quality of life, or PFM function. These can be assessed through patient-reported outcome measures, clinician-reported outcome measures, and instrument-measured outcomes; and (T) outcomes assessed before and after the intervention, at any follow-up timepoint, corresponding to either immediately after or within two&#x000a0;weeks post-intervention (short-term follow-up), beyond two&#x000a0;weeks but less than 12&#x000a0;months post-intervention (medium-term follow-up), or 12&#x000a0;months or longer post-intervention (long-term follow-up). Interventions delivered at any timepoint in relation to cancer treatment were included, i.e., before cancer treatment (prehabilitation), during cancer treatment, after cancer treatment (rehabilitation), or over more than one cancer treatment time phase (mixed).

Assessment timepoints were categorized into either &#x02018;baseline&#x02019; for the initial assessment before intervention, &#x02018;follow-up timepoint&#x02019; for subsequent assessments, or &#x02018;end timepoint&#x02019; when there was only one subsequent assessment, or when explicitly identified as such by the authors in cases of multiple follow-up assessments. To facilitate interpretation of individual study results, data values along with their significance, or narrative descriptions, were used to indicate the &#x02018;direction of findings&#x02019;. Considerations for interpretation were summarized to offer further insight to the reader. Among these, studies were assigned a TIDieR checklist score, where each item described in the checklist within the paper was given a point of &#x02018;1&#x02019;.

Bowel dysfunction may occur in 18% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] to 24% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] of females following breast cancer treatment and cause significant distress and impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Therefore effectiveness of PFM or education-based therapies on bowel function remains an important and under-researched area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Sexual Function</title><p id="Par32">Sexual function was the most frequently reported outcome in the studies included in this review, and most studies investigated education-based therapies. Across all study designs, mixed findings were reported regarding the effectiveness of these therapies to improve sexual function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and they may or may not improve sexual satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This finding is in line with a Cochrane review which examined the evidence for multiple interventions targeting sexual dysfunction in females with cancer and did not find clear evidence of the impact of interventions&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition to the potential lack of statistical power which could explain this inconsistent finding, the heterogeneity in participant characteristics (e.g., age, types of breast cancer treatment, time since cancer treatment, types and severity of sexual dysfunction at baseline) and intervention content could be contributing factors. Although it is unclear if the mode of delivery could play a role in the effectiveness of education-based therapies, a few elements suggest that their effectiveness could be enhanced by a more personalized and goal-oriented intervention (rather than giving general information to all), higher dosage, higher participant compliance with recommendations, and providing more opportunities for interaction with a healthcare provider. The review of Seav et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] concurs with the importance of having a specific therapeutic goal with education-based therapies. Findings of the current review differ from theirs, primarily due to the differences in study eligibility criteria. In this review, studies were included if the interventions had a plausible explanation for influencing pelvic floor function, i.e., if they targeted sexual dysfunction of a hypothesized source involving dysfunction of the pelvic floor, and regardless of the presence of sexual dysfunction at baseline.</p><p id="Par33">Findings of studies investigating PFM therapies in this review were limited and with mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, the study reporting that the intervention did not improve overall sexual function was an RCT in which PFM therapy (passive)&#x02009;+&#x02009;education was provided, with unclear dosage, and no data on adherence to the intervention was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This is not surprising as it has been suggested that intervention dosage, adherence, and supervision are critical for optimal effectiveness in cancer populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, a recent systematic review highlighted the contribution of the PFMs in sexual function/response in females, and a statistically-significant moderate association between PFM strength and sexual function was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This suggests that PFM therapy (passive) may be insufficient to improve sexual function, whereas PFM therapy (active), as used in the single-group trials which showed an improvement in sexual function, should be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Overall, interpretation of our findings underlines that sexual dysfunction in breast cancer populations may arise from multiple sources, making it critical to identify the most likely sources using a biopsychosocial lens to target them effectively with evidence-based components and appropriate dosages. Available evidence suggests that PFM therapies (active) and combined, multimodal therapies deserve further investigation in more robust and adequately powered studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Future studies may need to be flexible, allowing for tailoring when applied to a heterogenous population to enhance effectiveness. The importance of adopting this patient-centered approach is further reinforced by the fact that sexual satisfaction is a complex construct with a definition that is unique for each individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Psychological Function</title><p id="Par35">Based on the evidence from RCTs, education-based therapies are not effective for improving psychological function in breast cancer populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although TG interventions were well reported, they had potentially low or inadequate dosage and adherence. Both single-group trials reported improvement in anxiety but not in depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Although these studies investigated different types of intervention (PFM therapy vs education-based therapy) and had small sample sizes, it is possible that dosage was sufficient for the included participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is worth noting that none of the studies in this review were designed or powered to specifically address psychological dysfunction, therefore it may be unsurprising that the majority, and all RCTs, found no improvement in this non-primary outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Quality of Life</title><p id="Par36">According to the evidence from three RCTs, education-based therapies are not effective for improving quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similarly, as described in the psychological function section, these studies, which also assessed psychological function and found no effect, were not designed or powered to improve quality of life. However, an improvement in several quality of life domains was observed following CBT and when CBT was combined with physical exercise provided further and longer-term effects. A recent review concluded that physical exercise improves quality of life in breast cancer populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and therefore if the goal of therapy is to improve quality of life, including physical exercise as a component of conservative therapies should be considered. One single-group trial reported an improvement in quality of life following PFM therapy (active&#x02009;+&#x02009;passive), although it is unclear which domains beside endocrine symptoms were improved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>General Observations and Recommendations for Future Research</title><p id="Par37">Compared with the recent review on conservative therapies in gynecological cancer populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], most therapies in this review were education-based with a direct or indirect intent of improving sexual function, among other outcomes. This general direction in research is not surprising given the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in breast cancer populations and the low resource requirements to deliver education. The quality reporting of TG interventions in this review was superior on average when compared with studies in the other review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, this may be explained by the simplicity of describing a unimodal intervention, such as education-based therapies, where there are fewer elements to report. What seems critical for future studies, however, is design of an intervention that is likely to have an effect on the outcome, thorough recording and reporting of participant&#x02019;s adherence to the intervention. This is essential to determine whether improvements are due to the application of these recommendations and to understand the mechanisms of effect.</p><p id="Par38">This review highlighted several considerations for the design of future studies on education-based therapies, and also identified gaps in knowledge regarding PFM therapies and combined, multimodal therapies in this population. Available evidence indicates that it is worth considering PFM therapies and combined, multimodal therapies. Mechanistic and controlled studies are required to determine if this population or subgroups benefit from these therapies. Recommendations for future research are presented in the above sections per outcome. In addition, an observation that emerged from interpretation of findings related to psychological function and quality of life is that these outcomes were not the primary focus in the studies. This raises questions about their inclusion. Given that RCTs should prioritize meaningful outcomes for patients, and that quality of life is one of the most meaningful outcomes, future studies should consider include these outcomes if the study design or intervention is likely to impact these outcomes.</p><p id="Par39">This review also identified several pitfalls in the design of included studies, emphasizing the importance of exercising caution when interpretating study results and the need for further research. The majority of studies had multiple outcomes without controlling for the potential bias of multiple comparisons, lacked an a priori sample size calculation, and did not identify a primary outcome. Additionally, some studies had small sample sizes, no CG, at least a moderate risk of bias, compared similar interventions, or may have included an heterogenous population who could have responded differently to therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>General Recommendations for Clinical Practice</title><p id="Par40">High-quality evidence, often from RCTs, should underpin clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, RCTs are costly, resource-intensive, and challenging to conduct in a short timeframe to enable rapid implementation in the clinical setting. Therefore, clinical practice should be guided by the best available evidence, including findings from non-RCTs when RCT data is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. As previously discussed, breast cancer females often experience symptoms of sexual dysfunction and pelvic floor disorders. Although education-based therapies seem to offer advantages over PFM therapies and combined, multimodal therapies &#x02013; such as versatile delivery modes for adaptability across different contexts and the possibility of involvement of various healthcare providers &#x02013; evidence emphasizes that proper screening and identification of therapeutic goals are essential to determine the therapy components. Available data are encouraging for PFM therapies and combined, multimodal therapies in breast cancer populations, and these may be considered if evaluation reveals they can address the patient&#x02019;s needs. Clinicians should consider personalized and goal-oriented therapies, with appropriate dosages, strategies to enhance participant adherence and opportunities for patient interaction with a healthcare provider. Given the scant knowledge to date of effectiveness of conservative therapies in this population, monitoring for adverse events is crucial, even when education only is provided, and clinicians are advised to use their clinical judgement to determine the best treatment strategy for optimal outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p id="Par41">Major strengths of this systematic review were the comprehensive search strategy, inclusion of various study designs and a wide range of outcomes. This allowed us to assign a level of evidence to the effect of different interventions on different outcomes important to patients. This approach also enabled us to identify key areas for future research and considerations for clinical practice. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, assessed the risk of bias and quality of studies, and extracted the data. The use of the TIDieR checklist ensured a standardized approach to extracting information related to the TG intervention and assessing quality reporting. Despite these strengths, some limitations warrant consideration when interpreting the findings. A meta-analysis was not feasible due to the limited number and heterogeneity of studies. While some results suggest effectiveness of specific conservative therapies in breast cancer populations, more research is required.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">This study is the first to review the evidence of effectiveness of PFM and education-based therapies in breast cancer populations.
