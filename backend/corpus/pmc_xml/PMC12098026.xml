In this study, we report a 31-year-old Chinese female with the characteristic clinical features of woolly hair and hypotrichosis. Through whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified a novel missense variant (NM_139248.3: c.530T&#x0003e;G: p.Leu177Arg) and a previously reported missense variant (c.742C&#x0003e;A: p.His248Asn) of <italic>LIPH</italic> in the patient. TA cloning demonstrated that these variants were located on different alleles, supporting an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. <italic>In silico</italic> tools predicted the novel variant to be disease-causing, likely reducing the stability of PA-PLA<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1;, the protein encoded by <italic>LIPH</italic>. PA-PLA<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1;, a member of the AB hydrolase superfamily and the lipase family, functions as a secreted protein to perform its hydrolytic and catalytic activities. Through a secretion assay, we observed that the novel missense variant c.530T&#x0003e;G almost abolished the secretion of the variant protein compared to the control (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). The direct blocking of secretion has only been reported in two variants in previous studies. This means that it is likely to result in the complete loss of its hydrolytic function, which will eventually lead to the disease. Notably, all the variants that directly stopped secretion happened when the normal amino acid was replaced by arginine. This suggests that the arginine substitutions may be closely linked to making secretion less effective. Our study not only elucidates the genetic underlying in a Chinese patient with woolly hair but also clarifies its pathogenic mechanism. These discoveries may facilitate the advancement of future diagnostic and treatment approaches.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>woolly hair</kwd><kwd>hypotrichosis</kwd><kwd>ARWH</kwd><kwd>LIPH</kwd><kwd>missense variant</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Disease onset typically occurs soon after birth and is clinically characterized by coarse, sparse, dry, and tightly curled hair, which may also involve beard and axillary hair (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Kazantseva et al., 2006</xref>). Compared with other family members, patients usually have blonde or lighter hair (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Horev et al., 2009</xref>). ARWH exhibits significant genetic heterogeneity, with causative variants identified in several genes. Based on these genes, ARWH is classified into three types: ARWH1 (OMIM #278150) caused by variants in <italic>LPAR6</italic>, ARWH2 (OMIM #604379) caused by variants in <italic>LIPH</italic>, and ARWH3 (OMIM #616760) caused by variants in <italic>KRT25</italic>. Additionally, homozygous nonsense variants in <italic>C3orf52</italic>, which interacts with LIPH, have also been detected in individuals with ARWH (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Kazantseva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Pasternack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Shimomura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ansar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Malki et al., 2020</xref>). Understanding the specific roles of these genes and the consequences of their variants is essential for elucidating the pathology of ARWH.</p><p>Among the causative genes of ARWH, the <italic>LIPH</italic> gene has received particular attention. Situated on chromosome 3q27-q28, <italic>LIPH</italic> spans approximately 45&#x000a0;kb and contains 10 exons (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2002</xref>). It encodes the enzyme lipase member H (phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A1&#x003b1;, PA-PLA<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1;). This secreted enzyme works extracellularly, hydrolyzing phosphatidic acid (PA) to produce lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which is an essential molecule for the growth of hair follicles (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Horev et al., 2009</xref>). Consequently, the functional disruption of PA-PLA<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1; has been recognized as a key mechanism in ARWH2 pathogenesis. This disruption leads to deficient LPA production, which severely impairs normal hair development and results in the characteristic ARWH phenotype. Existing studies on pathogenic <italic>LIPH</italic> variants have predominantly focused on those impairing the hydrolytic activity of PA-PLA<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1;, whereas cases involving secretion defects are comparatively rare and remain less explored as a pathogenic mechanism. This leaves a gap in our understanding of ARWH pathogenesis, particularly secretion defects, which requires further study.</p><p>Here, we report a Chinese patient with clinical symptoms of woolly hair and hypotrichosis since birth. In this patient, we identified a novel variant (NM_139248.3: c.530T&#x0003e;G, p.Leu177Arg) and a reported variant (c.742C&#x0003e;A, p.His248Asn) in <italic>LIPH</italic>. Through genetic and functional analyses, we confirmed that this novel variant disrupts the development of hair follicles by completely abolishing PA-PLA<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1; secretion function, ultimately resulting in ARWH. Notably, this study found that arginine substitutions may lead to defective PA-PLA<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1; secretion, providing evidence for a previously unrecognized pathogenic mechanism. Finally, we systematically reviewed reported pathogenic variants of ARWH and their corresponding phenotypes across populations, revealing that <italic>LIPH</italic> variants are the predominant cause of ARWH in Chinese patients. This highlights the importance of prioritizing <italic>LIPH</italic> gene variants in the clinical diagnosis of Chinese patients with ARWH-like symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>2 Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1 Clinical data collection and ethical compliance</title><p>This study enrolled patients who presented with distinct phenotypes of short, thin, and curly hair.

Ultimately, two missense variants were identified in <italic>LIPH</italic> (NM_139248.3): c.530T&#x0003e;G (p.Leu177Arg) and c.742C&#x0003e;A (p.His248Asn). These variants were verified by Sanger sequencing (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The p.His248Asn variant was a known pathogenic variant associated with woolly hair/hypotrichosis. The p.Leu177Arg variant, on the other hand, was novel and had not been found in the dbSNP database, HGMD, or in-house databases (all reported pathogenic variants were shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Referring to the InterPro database, this novel variant residue is situated in a crucial domain known as lipase (IPR013818), very close to the active site (Asp178) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This evidence suggests it has the potential to affect protein function by modifying the area surrounding the site. The leucine residue at amino acid position 177 is highly conserved across species (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The variant was predicted to be pathogenic by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis tools (REVEL, 0.983 damaging; Mutation Taster, 1 disease-causing; CADD, 29.7 pathogenic). The classification of the variant was &#x0201c;likely pathogenic&#x0201d; (PM1+PM2_supporting + PP3_strong) according to the ACMG/AMP 2015 guideline.

Recent genetic studies on human hair disorders have demonstrated the essential role of LIPH-LPA-LPAR6 signaling in hair shaft development (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Minakawa et al., 2024</xref>). It is proposed that the 2-acyl-LPA that PA-PLA<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1; generates in the IRS activates LPAR6 through either paracrine or autocrine mechanisms (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Inoue et al., 2011</xref>). This activation induces the release of membrane-bound pro-TGF&#x003b1; through TACE-dependent mechanisms. Soluble TGF&#x003b1; then binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on IRS cells, activating EGFR and promoting IRS development for proper hair shaft formation. The p.His248Asn variant has been reported to cause a complete loss of PA-PLA<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1; hydrolytic activity and failure to activate LPAR6, despite not affecting PA-PLA<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1; secretion (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Shinkuma et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we found that the novel p.Leu177Arg variant directly led to a severe secretion defect of PA-PLA<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1;, resulting in impaired hydrolytic activity. Notably, such a severe secretion defect has only been observed in the p.Gly152Arg and p.His205Arg variants, with this the third instance (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). These findings suggest that variants resulting in the substitution of normal amino acids with arginine (Arg) may specifically impair PA-PLA<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1; secretion, as observed in p.Leu177Arg, p.Gly152Arg, and p.His205Arg. In contrast, other missense variants located near these three arginine-substitution sites, such as p.Cys246Ser, p.His248Asn, and even p.Ser154Ala&#x02014;which is only one residue away from p.Gly152Arg&#x02014;do not impact PA-PLA<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1; secretion (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Shinkuma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Arginine is particularly noteworthy due to its unique combination of physico-chemical properties, which distinguish it from most other amino acids. First, the side chain of arginine contains a guanidinium group, which endows it with a strong positive charge, making it the most positively charged residue among the 20 amino acids. This highly charged nature is unparalleled by other amino acids and allows arginine to participate in extensive ionic interactions and hydrogen bonding. However, in the context of protein folding, such strong electrostatic interactions can disrupt normal protein folding by affecting the stability of local structural elements (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Harms et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Perdriau et al., 2025</xref>). Second, arginine has one of the largest side chains among the 20 amino acids, and its bulkiness often introduces significant steric hindrance. This can lead to structural distortions, particularly when arginine is substituted in tightly packed regions (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Gupta and Uversky, 2024</xref>). When investigating the impact of the p.Leu177Arg, p.His205Arg, and p.Gly152Arg variants, it becomes evident that these unique properties of arginine play a significant role. After arginine substitutions (p.Gly152Arg and p.His205Arg variants), the substituted arginine interacted with more nearby residues by hydrogen bonds (<xref rid="s12" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figures S1A&#x02013;D</xref>), whereas other missense variants such as p.Ser154Ala and p.His248Asn tended to reduce interactions with other residues (<xref rid="s12" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figures S1E&#x02013;H</xref>). Furthermore, arginine substitutions significantly increased residue size due to its bulky side chain. An increased number of interacting residues may work together with the bigger residue itself to form a larger group that disrupts the native conformation of the protein, causing steric hindrance and a loss of flexibility required for proper folding, ultimately resulting in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention and impaired secretion. The consistent observation across multiple variants suggests a potential mechanistic link between arginine substitutions and secretion defects. This observation provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying protein secretion defects. Further research is required to confirm these findings.</p><p>Additionally, in this study, we conducted a literature review and comprehensively compiled the reported pathogenic variants of ARWH along with their corresponding phenotypes and populations (<xref rid="s12" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Our findings indicated that <italic>LIPH</italic> variants are the predominant cause of ARWH in Chinese patients, with no significant differences in phenotypic severity observed across different variants. In contrast, only one case has been associated with a <italic>KRT25</italic> variant, and no reported cases have been linked to <italic>LPAR6</italic> variants. Therefore, when clinically diagnosing Chinese patients who present with woolly hair and hypotrichosis, particular attention should be given to genetic screening for potential <italic>LIPH</italic> variants.</p><p>Despite the promising results of this study, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, while genetic and functional evidence strongly supports the pathogenicity of the <italic>LIPH</italic> variant, several predicted loss-of-function variants have been observed in public databases, such as GnomAD. However, in contrast to the other variants, which primarily affect the hydrolytic activity, the novel variant p.Leu177Arg identified here directly disrupts protein expression, leading to a complete loss of secretion, highlighting a less common pathogenic mechanism. Second, our finding is based on a single patient. Future investigations involving larger cohorts would be essential to validate these findings and better clarify the genotype-phenotype correlations of <italic>LIPH</italic> variants.</p><p>In conclusion, this study reported a patient with ARWH and confirmed the clinical diagnosis through <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, demonstrating that the novel <italic>LIPH</italic> c.530T&#x0003e;G (p.Leu177Arg) variant affected protein function by impairing PA-PLA<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1; secretion. This direct effect on protein secretion is extremely rare in previous studies of ARWH and may be related to arginine substitutions, providing new insights into the pathogenic mechanism of ARWH. Our findings expand the spectrum of <italic>LIPH</italic> variants associated with ARWH of Chinese origin and have the potential to influence the formulation of new diagnostic and treatment approaches for this condition.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We sincerely thank the participants for their cooperation in this study.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The data presented in the study are deposited in the Figshare repository, <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28853567" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28853567</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s6"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The studies involving humans were approved by Institutional Review Board of Peking Union Medical College (Approval No. 2022170).
