The interpretation of these variants is challenging as functional evidence is required to validate pathogenicity. We explored the diagnostic value of a targeted long-read cDNA sequencing (lrcDNA-seq) approach to investigate IRD-associated splicing defects. For each affected individual, RNA was isolated from blood, and for each candidate gene, cDNA amplicons, spanning the complete open reading frame or multiple exons, were generated and subjected to long-read sequencing. We validated our approach by assessing previously described pathogenic splice-altering variants in IRD-associated genes. Next, we investigated six genetically unexplained affected individuals, each carrying pathogenic variant(s) in <italic>NMNAT1</italic>. In two probands, we provided functional validation for previously identified variants of uncertain significance present on the second allele. In four other subjects, lrcDNA-seq revealed the partial inclusion of an SVA_F retrotransposon in the <italic>NMNAT1</italic> mRNA, predicted to introduce a premature stop codon. We showed that targeted lrcDNA-seq is effective in characterizing splice defects and in identifying novel splice-altering variants and uncovered the IRD genetic basis for six previously unexplained subjects. We believe that the implementation of this technique has the potential to contribute to an increased diagnostic rate of IRDs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0015"><p>Splice-altering variants contribute to the missing heritability of inherited retinal diseases.

Through the analysis of the validation cohort, we were able to detect the previously observed findings. Additionally, in <italic>IMPG2</italic> or <italic>CHM</italic> we identified previously undetected and low-abundant transcript alterations. These findings highlighted (1) the higher sensitivity of lrcDNA-seq compared to midigene-based splice assays and short-read RNA-seq, (2) the added value of amplifying the entire (or longer unbiased portions of) transcript and of studying a variant in a broader natural genomic context, and (3) the phasing: amplification of the entire transcripts has the potential to discriminate different alleles&#x02019; transcripts. Nevertheless, the possibility of phasing depends on the presence of allele-discriminating SNPs or variants within the mRNA/cDNA amplicon. Although the targeted nature of our method (requiring a PCR amplification step) introduces a bias and limits the detection of novel fusion transcripts and UTRs, it also holds several advantages, including higher throughput, lower costs, and deeper sequencing of the transcript of interest.

Moreover, the authors showed the impossibility of detecting some transcript alterations (e.g., frameshift) due to the low coverage caused by the activation of NMD and/or the short reads lengths.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Although not investigated in the present study, this limitation caused by NMD could be overcome by the use of RNA derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines, which can be treated with NMD inhibitors (e.g., cycloheximide), to allow further characterization of the magnitude of specific variants. Nevertheless, we have shown that by employing a deep-sequencing approach such as our lrcDNA-seq method, it is possible to pick up extremely low abundant transcripts that are possibly subjected to NMD such as the allele derived from the NM_00390.3:c.1510&#x000a0;+ 693_1510&#x000a0;+ 694ins1414&#x02212;1244_1510&#x000a0;+ 402inv variant in the carrier, P-5&#x02019;s sibling (1.3% of the sequencing reads).</p><p id="p0180">Another example study combined the midigene assays or RT-PCR-based approach with nanopore sequencing to functionally characterize predicted splice-altering variants in individuals affected by IRDs.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Despite being successful in detecting aberrant transcripts, doubts about the effectiveness of these approaches have been raised when applied to tissues not directly associated with the disease pathogenesis. The existence of cell-specific transcript isoforms and splicing is a well-known phenomenon, and this limitation could also be true for the targeted lrcDNA method.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Further efforts are required to validate the technique on more biologically relevant samples (e.g., photoreceptor precursor cells).</p><p id="p0185">Based on our results, we conclude that the proposed targeted lrcDNA-seq tool can successfully be performed on easily accessible tissues such as blood to contribute to genetic diagnostics for IRDs when performed in parallel with genomic screening. Considering the relatively small sample number analyzed in the discovery cohort, follow-up studies are required to optimize the technique to investigate its full potential and its translation to other diseases and IRD-associated genes. Nevertheless, we speculate that this approach could be extended to a wide range of genetic diseases in case a strong splicing-affecting variant is identified and requires functional validation to complete a genetic diagnosis, or when a second pathogenic variant cannot be detected by first-step diagnostic analysis in the presence of a first hit in a gene strongly correlated to the individual&#x02019;s phenotype.</p><p id="p0190">The use of RT-PCR and subsequent long-read targeted sequencing directly performed on blood-derived cDNA makes this pipeline a faster and cheaper alternative compared to transcriptome-wide approaches (e.g., Iso-Seq or short-read RNA-seq) and more reliable when compared to artificial systems (e.g., midigene assays). Therefore, this method could aid in providing more affected individuals with genetic diagnoses and potentially improve diagnostics rates, ultimately allowing more effective genetic counseling and better guidance toward gene-specific therapies in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec5"><title>Data and code availability</title><p id="p0195">All the data generated during the present study can be obtained from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
