The aim of this study was to use SNA to characterise how individual cognitive performance affects agonistic behaviour. Using 175 pigs, we hypothesised that their choice of opponents would be affected by their ability to discriminate spatial information and to adapt their behaviour when cues were reversed. A spatial discrimination test was conducted; left and right locations were assigned as positive (food reward) and negative (fan) and each pig&#x02019;s learning speed was recorded. The cues were then reversed, and we tested whether pigs adjusted their behaviour. At age 14 weeks, pigs were regrouped into 14 groups, and their behaviour recorded for 5h, from which weighted and unweighted networks were constructed. Skin lesions were counted after 24h, 1 week and 2 weeks. Males delivered more aggression, and heavier pigs were involved in more aggression. Betweenness centrality (a network position linking otherwise unconnected individuals) increased with network size and decreased with body weight. Passing the reversal learning test predicted more involvement in unilateral aggression. The current study therefore shows links between cognitive performance and aggression and advances the understanding of social network analysis in the context of animal welfare.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cognitive neuroscience</kwd><kwd>Ecology</kwd><kwd>Animal behaviour</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Living in dynamic social groups requires an ability to appropriately respond to the behaviour of others and is hypothesised to be cognitively taxing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The cognitive component of aggression has not been defined experimentally but navigating agonistic encounters is thought to involve reference memory of previous events and opponents, comparison against current circumstances and selection of appropriate behaviours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Pigs are an ideal species to study the effects of cognitive ability on resolution of aggressive contests. Pigs engage in cognitive tasks, are particularly suited to foraging tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, can distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics (whether or not they are genetically related)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and fight to establish a dominance hierarchy under commercial farm conditions. Pig producers commonly perform social mixing of unfamiliar pigs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and group composition is determined by management requirements. Social mixing often occurs several times in a lifetime for growing pigs and breeding sows, each time provoking aggression, which compromises health, welfare and growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Aggression after regrouping is drastically reduced after 24&#x02013;48 hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, but dominance relationships may be reinforced with brief or non-damaging agonistic behaviour. However, instability in dominance hierarchies can lead to overt fighting even 3 weeks after group mixing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Cognitive ability could reduce the welfare costs of sudden changes in the environment, in particular the need to navigate new social groups, to form preferential associations with benign or subordinate conspecifics and avoid unresolved conflicts. Stable social relationships with the mother and littermates are disrupted due to abrupt, early weaning and group mixing, so piglets are unable to gradually assimilate new individuals and experiences as wild pigs would<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, hence the cognitive challenge of broadening the social group beyond immediate relatives is increased in the domestic setting.</p><p id="Par4">We apply cognitive tests to isolate cognitive from non-cognitive factors affecting agonistic behaviour, such as body weight and sex. Although validated tests of cognition in pigs are mostly non-social<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, we hypothesise that these cognitive skills may generalise across domains, i.e., the ability to categorise opponents using visual information may influence agonistic behaviour. Approximating a rival&#x02019;s fighting ability using visual information would allow pigs to avoid the costs of fighting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Consistent with this idea of cognitive rival assessment, pairs of pigs which had visual, olfactory and acoustic contact prior to dyadic contests had shorter contests than those which had no contact, including a shorter biting phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Social network analysis can be applied to quantify complexity in post-mixing aggression in newly weaned and fattening pigs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and to predict the likelihood of pigs receiving skin lesions. The agonistic behaviour of a pig is affected by the agonistic behaviour of its group mates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and by each pig&#x02019;s previous experience, which affects injury, fatigue, HPA activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and affective state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, social network centrality measures can provide novel insights into the social structure within a pen. For instance, win networks, which distinguish between winners and losers, offer deeper insights into dominance hierarchies, especially when analysing centrality measures such as eigenvector and degree centrality, both of which correlate with pigs&#x02019; dominance ranks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Additionally, in competitive environments, pigs may benefit from selecting opponents with higher eigenvector centrality, i.e. animals that have a strong connection to other influential group members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, reflecting their prior fighting experience. Fighting against this kind of animal may lead to more efficient contest resolution and reduce the need for prolonged conflicts. We evaluate the social network characteristics of degree, betweenness and eigenvector centrality (defined in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These metrics have been shown to be suitable for predicting skin lesions received during aggression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, even in modest group sizes (12&#x02013;15) of indoor housed pigs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Using this approach, we can generate multiple groups of pigs with known cognitive performance and analyse network traits that are relevant to welfare.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Definitions of social network traits, adapted from farine and whitehead(2015)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Term</th><th align="left">Definition</th><th align="left">Practical implications</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Degree centrality</p><p><italic>(also &#x0201c;Sociality&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;all-degree centrality&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;unweighted degree centrality&#x0201d;)</italic></p></td><td align="left">Number of nodes with which the subject directly interacted either as actor or receiver</td><td align="left">A pig with high degree centrality interacts aggressively with a high proportion of potential opponents</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Weighted degree centrality</p><p><italic>(also &#x0201c;strength&#x0201d;)</italic></p></td><td align="left">Total frequency or duration of interactions between the subject and its directly connected nodes</td><td align="left">A pig with high weighted degree centrality interacts aggressively with a high proportion of potential opponents and for a long duration</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Outdegree centrality</p><p><italic>(weighted outdegree centrality</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;<italic>&#x0201c;out-strength&#x0201d;</italic></p></td><td align="left">Number of directed edges, where the node concerned is the actor.

Pre-weaning socialisation (age 2&#x02013;4 weeks) and post-weaning enrichment treatments were applied (described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>) to stimulate variation in cognitive development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Briefly, enriched pens were larger (11.2 m<sup>2</sup>), with deep straw bedding and a range of enrichment materials that were frequently replenished. Barren pens were smaller (5.5 m<sup>2</sup>) and were minimally enriched, with wood shavings and mats for thermal comfort. Here, we focus on the correlations between cognitive test performance and later agonistic behaviour, rather than investigating the causes of cognitive differences. We define cognitive performance experimentally rather than directly comparing the early life treatments with aggressive outcomes, because i) we applied the treatments at the litter level and would require an unfeasibly large sample size to separate genetic, maternal and treatment effects on cognition, ii) enrichment may influence motivation as well as cognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and iii) socialisation and enrichment do not affect individuals equally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">From weaning, pigs were habituated to humans in the pen. Gentling was applied gradually over 2 weeks, only moving to the next stage when pigs were willing to approach, starting with a person sitting in the pen, then standing and walking, then using a pig board, then touching the pigs&#x02019; head and body (to prepare for later lesion scoring). At 6 weeks of age, four test pigs per litter were moved to an experimental building and penned in litter groups. Each pen contained 4 familiar littermates (range 3&#x02013;5) plus up to 5 additional littermates which were used as stimulus pigs in a social preference test (not analysed in this study). Stimulus pigs were removed from the group before training for the cognitive tests started at 8 weeks of age. Thereafter, group composition was stable until experimental regrouping at 14 weeks of age. From 6 to 9 weeks, pigs were gradually habituated to food rewards (a chocolate peanut and a slice of banana), handling and brief isolation from pen-mates. At 9 weeks, pigs were habituated to the test arena and goal box (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Image of goal box used for the spatial discrimination test.

Left and right locations were assigned as positive (food reward) and negative (no food reward and a fan turned on) respectively and pigs were then allocated to positive as either left or right, balanced within sex and litter. Each pig had two pre-acquisition sessions of six trials, during which they learnt to open the goal box, and then five sessions of pseudorandomised training trials, containing a total of 36 trials. We avoided presenting more than two negative trials consecutively so pigs were not too discouraged. If pigs did not habituate or did not explore the box in the negative location with sufficient remaining trials to pass (12 trials), they were excluded. This was to confirm that avoiding the negative location was due to a learnt association rather than neophobia. We then measured learning speed from the trial during which the pig first opened the goal box in the negative location, i.e. had experienced both types of cue. Learning speed was measured in number of trials to reach the pass criterion.</p><p id="Par16">In each trial, pigs were taken out of the arena by experimenters once they had: i) eaten the reward, ii) made a &#x0201c;no go&#x0201d; decision by looking towards the goal box and returning to the entry gate for three seconds, iii) exhibited signs of stress (loud or high-pitched vocalizations, attempting to escape from the arena), or iv) after 30 s. Between trials within a session, the pig left the arena for the time it took to replenish and/or move the goal box. The pass criterion was based on consistent correct decisions with a probability of p&#x02009;&#x0003c; 0.05, which equated to 10/12 consecutive correct decisions. A correct decision was &#x0201c;go&#x0201d; (opening the goal box) if the box was in the positive location, or &#x0201c;no go&#x0201d; (do not open the goal box) if the box was in the negative location.</p><p id="Par17">Latency to open the goal box was recorded live using a stopwatch by an observer positioned at the entrance to the arena. In cases where it was unclear whether the pig had opened the goal box, the experimenter (positioned behind the goal box, as shown in figure S3) provided confirmation to the observer. Latency was recorded to the nearest second. While formal inter-observer reliability tests were not conducted between the four observers, all new observers were paired with an experienced scorer for initial sessions to ensure consistency in scoring. Additionally, observers were rotated across test groups and times of day to avoid systematic bias.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Reversal learning</title><p id="Par18">The reversal learning test took place during batches 3&#x02013;8 (total 151 pigs) of which 102 demonstrated a consistent preference for the positive over the negative location in the spatial discrimination and then completed the reversal learning test.

Pigs were given up to 3 refresher sessions of 6 trials each, for habituation to the second box, and to confirm that they remembered the reward location. The reversal learning phase followed, comprising 20 trials during which the positive and negative locations were reversed. In the first trial of the reversal learning test, once the pig had opened the goal box in the new negative location or after 30 s, the flap of the box in the new positive location was opened by the experimenter to reveal the reward. A pass result in the reversal learning test required pigs to approach the new positive location as a first choice, for 6/6 or 10/12 consecutive trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Regrouping</title><p id="Par20">At 14 weeks of age, the four pigs in each litter were ranked according to the outcome of the spatial discrimination and reversal learning tests.

The two highest scoring pigs were allocated to a &#x0201c;high test performance&#x0201d; group and the other two to a &#x0201c;low test performance&#x0201d; group. It was essential to balance groups based on litter as pigs perform more aggression towards unfamiliar pigs than littermates. Each pig was accompanied by a single littermate, when possible. Due to variations in litter sizes or pigs being removed from the trial due to health issues, four pigs moved with no littermate; 136 with 1 littermate; 31 with 2 littermates; and 4 moved with 3 littermates.</p><p id="Par21">Pens were 6.1 &#x000d7;&#x02009;2.35 m including a slatted dunging area, with a maximum of 16 pigs per pen, resulting in a space allowance of 1.02 m<sup>2</sup>/pig on average. Within each of 7 batches, males and females were equally distributed across pens and the body weight variation within each mixed pen was kept to a minimum. This resulted in 175 pigs being relocated across 14 groups (across 7 batches). Throughout the experiment, pigs were identified using spray paint (see figure S4). In the morning, prior to mixing, pigs were weighed to the nearest 0.5 kg and whilst in the weigh crate were given a new identification mark, to avoid having multiple pigs with the same ID in the same pen. Mean body weight and standard deviation were 62.4 &#x000b1;&#x02009;7.2 kg overall and within each pen, standard deviation varied from 3.78- 6.84 kg.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Aggressive behaviour and skin lesions</title><p id="Par22">Pens were video recorded for 5 h continuously immediately post-mixing. Mixing was carried out at midday after morning husbandry in the building where the pigs were housed, to avoid further disruption., and behavioural data were obtained using &#x0201c;The Observer XT15 and XT16&#x0201d; software (Noldus, Wageningen, NL). This period has been identified as an appropriate window to capture the peak of aggression after regrouping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. For all aggressive interactions, the identity of the giver and receiver and the type of behaviour was recorded by a single observer (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) who was blind to the cognitive performance of each pig and the category of the pen (high/low cognitive performance). The data for all 14 pens were scored in 30-min segments, rather than scoring the batches sequentially, to ensure any variation in scoring would not be systematic across batches. The use of a single highly trained observer was intended to avoid inter-observer variation. Nevertheless, in prior studies of post-mixing aggression in pigs, high levels of agreement between observers are reported, indicating a high level of consistency in use of this ethogram<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In the current study, the observer was trained by experienced colleagues (the same observers in the studies cited here). The same observer also counted all fresh skin lesions in the anterior, central, and posterior body regions immediately before group mixing, 24 h post-mixing, and at one week and two weeks post mixing. Lesions were considered recent if they were vivid red or recently scabbed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. All lesions observed were counted equally, regardless of size and severity. For lesion counting, it was not possible to perform intra-observer reliability testing across batches because this was carried out live. To avoid variation in how lesions were counted, the observer was trained by colleagues experienced in lesion scoring and followed a protocol used on the pig unit for previous studies. Skin lesion counts were calculated by subtracting lesions in the morning before mixing from lesions 24 h later. Negative numbers were converted to zero.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Ethogram of agonistic behaviour post-regrouping.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left" colspan="2">Behaviour</th><th align="left">Point or State</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Display</td><td align="left">Heads up</td><td align="left">Both pigs lift their snouts, so they are pointed in the air and alongside each other</td><td align="left">S</td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left">Parallel walking</td><td align="left">Both pigs walk simultaneously with the shoulders next to each other, terminated when pigs change position or stop walking</td><td align="left">S</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Non-damaging aggression</td><td align="left">Head-knock</td><td align="left">A rapid thrust upward or side to side with the head or snout against any part of another pig.

By 2 weeks post-mixing there were no significant associations between cognitive performance and skin lesions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par51">This study provides evidence that pigs which vary in cognitive performance have differential outcomes in their agonistic behaviour post mixing.</p><p id="Par52">We predicted that pigs with higher cognitive performance would receive less agonistic behaviour and avoid prolonged or repeated aggressive interactions. We also predicted that cognitive ability would decrease the cost of aggression in terms of skin lesions, which may be apparent during the acute, dominance-related fighting, or later at 1 or 2 weeks, reflecting undecided or unstable dominance relationships and conflict over resources. However, we found no relationship between cognitive performance and the total weighted all-degree, in-degree or out-degree in all agonistic behaviour networks (ALL). Agonistic behaviour that does not involve physical injury, such as parallel walking and pushing may be necessary for pigs to learn about unfamiliar opponents, and because they are low cost, learning to avoid these sorts of interactions is not ecologically relevant. Furthermore, in contrast to our predictions, passing the reversal learning test was associated with higher weighted degree centrality in unilateral aggression networks (unreciprocated aggression) and was related to receiving more skin lesions. There was no evidence that these pigs specifically acted as the givers or receivers of unilateral aggression.</p><p id="Par53">In line with predictions that pigs with better cognitive performance would receive fewer skin lesions, faster learning in the spatial discrimination task was associated with pigs receiving fewer skin lesions. However, this difference was reversed after one week and better performance in the reversal learning test was associated with receiving more skin lesions in the anterior body region. Similarly, other social network studies of pigs have found that lower centrality in aggression networks post-mixing did not translate to receiving fewer skin lesions 3 weeks post mixing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. It is possible that pigs which learnt the spatial association faster were more food-motivated than pigs which learnt the task slowly. In the acute period of fighting after mixing, agonistic behaviour occurs immediately when pigs enter the pen and is unrelated to feeder access. However, aggression that occurs later once dominance relationships have largely been settled are often related to feeder use, so these pigs could have been more involved in food competition at 1 week post mixing.</p><p id="Par54">We predicted that pigs with better cognitive performance would have better fighting success and higher eigenvector centrality. Our results partially support this; pigs with better performance in the reversal learning test had a tendency towards higher indegree and outdegree centrality in fighting networks directed by outcome, suggesting that they both won and lost against more opponents. The correlation between successful reversal learning performance, being involved in more unilateral aggression and being involved in fights with a decisive ending, both as winners and losers, suggests a possible link between cognitive performance and skilful fighting, including both offensive and defensive behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par55">Novel tests of social cognition may be required to access the cognitive domains relevant to aggression. Measuring assessment ability using repeated contests poses clear welfare problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and assays of cognition which involve pain and stress can themselves inhibit learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, therefore reward based learning is preferred. However, prior studies had limited success conditioning pigs to prefer one unfamiliar conspecific over another using food rewards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, which we also failed to achieve in a suitable time frame in pilot tests for this study.</p><p id="Par56">The association between passing the reversal learning test and receiving more anterior skin lesions could indicate that rather than selecting opponents based on the likelihood of winning, they select opponents of similar or slightly higher fighting ability based on the potential gain in dominance. To understand whether cognitive ability enhanced pigs&#x02019; success in winning contests, as we found in dyadic contests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and resulted in pigs&#x02019; occupying higher dominance ranks, dominance rating systems could be applied, such as Glicko-2, which takes into account the focal pig&#x02019;s fighting success, the fighting success of their opponents, and the confidence in this estimate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par57">The effect of network size on aggression was interesting and persisted even though we attempted to normalise social network outcomes by dividing by the total number of non-littermates. With more potential opponents, pigs engaged in more mutual fighting and less unilateral aggression. This may reflect pigs&#x02019; greater capacity to remember previous interactions with individuals in smaller groups, since brief unilateral aggression is used to maintain dominance relationships without escalating to fighting. Keeping pigs in large, homogenous groups is in contrast with the natural history of pigs, which live in matrilineal societies in which adult males are largely solitary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Weighted betweenness centrality was increased by network size in every type of network. In larger groups, indirect connections become more important and betweenness centrality may be more sensitive to cognitive differences if pigs were evaluated in large groups.</p><p id="Par58">In unweighted, directed networks, males were more central (degree) than females, i.e. they directed aggression towards a greater number of others. Males also performed more aggression overall, as is characteristic of pig aggression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Total aggression received (weighted indegree) was not affected by sex. The influence of sex on aggression may have limited our statistical power to detect more subtle influences of cognition, so testing cognitive effects on aggression in single sex groups may be more elucidating. Social network analysis of pigs has focussed on single sex groups of females or castrated males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. With pressure to eliminate castration in the EU, management changes must consider solutions to reduce aggressive behaviour between intact males. In this study the males were not castrated. Whilst reflecting the natural state of the animals, this likely resulted in larger sex differences compared to females than would have occurred if the males had been castrated. We did not have the capacity to test cognitive ability in large enough numbers to form balanced, single sex groups. Navigating mixed-sex groups could also be less cognitively demanding and therefore less sensitive to individual variation than single sex groups, because pigs can easily evaluate the sex of their opponent, compared with other aspects of fighting ability, such as size.</p><p id="Par59">Female pigs had higher eigenvector centrality than males in WIN networks, demonstrating that females were more likely to engage in conclusive fights against pigs which themselves had fights with conclusive outcomes. Persisting in a contest to a clear outcome may be more advantageous for females because the cost of fighting is lower in contests between females than males. Surprisingly, sex did not affect indegree or outdegree in WIN networks, which may reflect a tendency for mutual fighting to occur primarily between individuals of the same sex.</p><p id="Par60">Pigs with a higher body weight performed more aggression as shown in prior studies of regrouping aggression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Indegree (losing fights) was positively associated with body weight in WIN networks, which is unexpected since smaller pigs are more likely to lose dyadic contests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Higher body weight was associated with lower betweenness centrality in ALL networks, indicating that heavier pigs were less likely to connect individuals which did not directly interact. Larger pigs are more likely to be part of a fighting clique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and may have low betweenness because they fight with others that are already well connected in the network. Dynamic network analysis of post-grouping aggression would lead to a better understanding of the direction of causality between betweenness, body weight, feeding behaviour and dominance.</p><p id="Par61">A limitation of our experimental design was the necessity to train pigs between weaning and testing aggression at a commercially relevant age and body size, which led to an erosion from the initial sample size, similar to other studies involving spatial discrimination and reversal learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Pigs were regrouped even if they had not completed the cognitive tasks, to balance pen size and familiarity as far as possible. Therefore, social networks contained pigs which had no data for reversal learning.</p><p id="Par62">We also note that the limitations on pigs&#x02019; ability to avoid aggression in a confined environment may mask individual strengths in learning and memory. Studies suggest that reversal learning performance is enhanced in species with greater social complexity and may allow wild animals to live in larger groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> but intensely housed pigs have little choice over their own behaviour. This is an important finding, since in a confined pen of pigs kept at commercial stocking density, even pigs with higher cognitive ability may not have the space or opportunity to escape from attacks (figure S4). Testing pigs in larger or more complex environments may allow us to evaluate if pigs differ in their ability to use spatial skills to navigate both their spatial and social environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par63">We hypothesised that individual differences in cognitive ability would account for some of the unexplained variation in how pigs apportion aggression after group mixing. Most pigs successfully completed the spatial discrimination task, but their learning speed in this task did not predict centrality in social networks. Reversal learning performance had a minor effect on centrality in unweighted networks. We cannot over-interpret the importance of this result due to the large number of outcome measures evaluated and the limitation that only 51 pigs completed the reversal learning task. For future work, adapting the reversal learning test to extend the testing period may yield data on a greater proportion of pigs.</p><p id="Par64">It remains to be seen how cognitive ability affects pigs&#x02019; sequential decisions, and the next step in the understanding of centrality measures such as betweenness and eigenvector centrality could include dynamic network analysis. The development of social cognitive tests that could be applied in a short time frame before mixing could elucidate cognitive domains we were not able to test in this study, such as communication, social discrimination, and individual recognition. We adapted McLeman et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> to measure pigs&#x02019; ability to discriminate unfamiliar conspecifics by size, however the time required was too long to habituate and train sufficient numbers of pigs to form replicated, balanced groups and then test aggression at a commercially-relevant stage (growing pigs).</p><p id="Par65">In conclusion, the results of this study show that the performance of pigs in non-social cognitive tests does influence their role in group level aggression post mixing. However, the cognitive skills measured in these tests did not function as we had expected in protecting them from the costs of aggression. Since pigs can make associations between location and rewards and learn quickly to update information when cues are reversed, management strategies to reduce aggression could harness this capacity. This could include the use of more complex environments with multiple feeder locations, to reduce competition and allow defeated animals to avoid aggressors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
