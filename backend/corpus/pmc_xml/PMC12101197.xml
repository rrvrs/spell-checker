Introduction</title><p>Firefighters are at high risk for longer-term mental and physical health conditions due to the chronically and diversely stressful nature of their occupation [<xref rid="B1-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Stressors include physical (e.g., intense workload, dehydration, dangerous working conditions and abnormal sleep) and psychological (i.e., rescuing those in need, safe and quick decision-making during emergencies and dealing with traumas that may or may not have occurred at the expense of their decisions while on call [<xref rid="B2-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). To endure and recover from these regular stressors, firefighters must be resilient. Resilience is the ability to withstand, recover and grow in the face of stressors and changing demands [<xref rid="B3-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Resilience has been positively correlated with various aspects of health, including physical and mental health [<xref rid="B4-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Resilience may potentially play a significant role in the ability of firefighters to continue in the occupation without developing psychological health conditions [<xref rid="B6-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Previous research has demonstrated a negative relationship between the level of subjective resilience and the severity of PTSD symptoms in a sample of 116 professional firefighters [<xref rid="B7-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It is also important to explore potential mediating factors between resilience and PTSD. For instance, anxiety and depression have significantly mediated the relationship between resilience and PTSD in 125 firefighter&#x02013;paramedics [<xref rid="B1-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>A study by Zhang et al. demonstrated that higher levels of resilience were correlated to better emotional health in individuals compared to lower levels of resilience [<xref rid="B8-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, individuals that participated in higher levels of physical activity exhibited better emotional states and higher resilience compared to those that participated in lower levels of physical activity. Thus, those that are more resilient may participate in higher levels of exercise which may help reduce the risk for physical health conditions.</p><p>Firefighters are faced with significant physical challenges as part of their daily occupational demands. Among professional firefighters, job performance has been significantly correlated with total fitness, bench press strength, hand grip strength, bent-over row endurance, bench press endurance, shoulder press endurance, bicep endurance, squat endurance and 400 m sprint time [<xref rid="B9-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further, Michaelides et al. examined the predictability of specific fitness tests on firefighters&#x02019; performance via an ability test. Their results indicate that fitness tests significantly predict performance in firefighters [<xref rid="B10-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As mentioned above, firefighters are exposed to significant physical tasks during shifts and it follows that higher levels of fitness correspond to an increased job performance; but, what predicts fitness levels in firefighters?</p><p>Previous research has identified psychological variables that may be effective at predicting physical fitness in firefighters. The Preference for and Tolerance of the Intensity of Exercise Questionnaire (PRETIE-Q; [<xref rid="B11-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]) has been successful in predicting physical fitness in firefighters. Specifically, preference for exercise intensity was successful at predicting cardiovascular and muscular endurance while tolerance of exercise intensity nor extraversion were successful in predicting firefighter fitness [<xref rid="B12-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This underscores the importance of examining psychological factors that can predict physical performance in high-risk groups like firefighters. Identifying and providing helpful health resources to improve psychological factors that influence firefighter performance and fitness may enhance the retention and overall effectiveness of firefighters within the profession.</p><p>Thus, the primary aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between resilience and other psychological variables in full-time firefighters. The secondary aim was to determine the relationship between psychological variables and firefighter fitness. Trait psychological measures including trait anxiety, depression, dispositional resilience and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomology were compared with physical fitness variables including push-ups, plank hold and a 1.5 mile run in firefighters. We hypothesized that: H1: Dispositional resilience would predict anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms in firefighters. That is, higher resilience would be associated with significantly reduced anxiety, depression and PTSD symptomology. H2: Firefighters with greater dispositional resilience and lower trait anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms would display greater muscular and cardiovascular endurance. H3: While anxiety, depression and PTSD symptomology are separate mental health conditions, it was predicted that each psychological condition would be significantly correlated with and predictive of each other in firefighters.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-jfmk-10-00142"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>The purpose of the present manuscript was to examine the relationships between psychological variables and physiological outcomes in firefighters. Specifically, this study demonstrated the significant role resilience plays in the expression/display of trait and state anxiety, depressive symptoms and PSTD symptoms in firefighters. Further, this study showed that while resilience is highly related to psychological variables, it does not have an impact on performance variables. While the relationships between resilience and other psychological variables have been well documented in firefighters, there are few studies that assess these relationships with physiological outcomes.</p><p>First, it was hypothesized that dispositional resilience would be significantly correlated with and predictive of state anxiety, trait anxiety, depression and PTSD symptomology in firefighters. Correlation findings suggest that there is a significant relationship between resilience and other psychological conditions in firefighters. Specifically, firefighters who scored high in dispositional resilience reported significantly lower state anxiety, trait anxiety, depression symptoms and PTSD symptoms according to the STAI, BDI and PCL-5, respectively. Further, dispositional resilience accounted for 41, 25, 21 and 7 percent unique variance in TAI, SAI, BDI and PCL-5 scores, respectively. These results have been supported in the literature as resilience has been negatively correlated with anxiety, depression, job stress and PTSD symptoms in firefighters and firefighter&#x02013;paramedics [<xref rid="B1-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B7-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B17-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These results are also supported in other professions where individuals are exposed to high occupational stress. Police officers with lower resilience displayed significantly greater PTSD symptoms relative to police officers with higher resilience [<xref rid="B19-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and paramedics with low resilience experienced a significantly increase risk for PTSD, major depression and generalized anxiety disorder [<xref rid="B20-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Resilience can be described in several related ways, including (1) the capacity to endure, recover and thrive when confronted with stressors and changing demands, (2) a psychological coping mechanism that enhances one&#x02019;s ability to bounce back from adversity, (3) the ability to maintain positive adaptation in the face of hardship and (4) the ability to maintain a state of biopsychospiritual homeostasis following disruptive and adverse events [<xref rid="B3-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B21-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Due to the occupational demands placed on firefighters, it follows that higher resilience would lead to a decrease in psychological conditions associated with traumatic events and high-pressure environments. The results of the present study confirm this and support existing research. Resilience was significantly correlated with anxiety and depressive symptoms in a sample of 225 firefighters [<xref rid="B17-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and served as a mediator in the relationship between exposure to traumatic events and depression in a sample of 7151 Korean firefighters [<xref rid="B24-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, while not significant, resilience was negatively correlated with depression and PTSD symptoms in firefighters [<xref rid="B25-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This gives evidence that regardless of significance, resilience appears to be a consistent predictor of psychological distress in firefighters. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have identified resilience as a positive predictor for psychological distress in firefighters. Therefore, while higher resilience scores are typically associated with significantly lower symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD, no studies have found that higher resilience is linked to increased symptoms of these conditions.</p><p>Next, it was hypothesized that firefighters with greater dispositional resilience and lower trait anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms would display greater muscular and cardiovascular endurance. Specifically, the firefighters that completed push-ups, plank holds, and a 1.5 mile run/walk for time. The results indicate that no significant relationships were present except for depressive symptoms predicting a significant percentage of push-ups completed. This is surprising and goes against the current hypothesis. While no clear relationships have been shown between psychological measures and physical fitness tests in firefighters, previous research has shown select psychological variables to be related to physical outcomes. Trait anxiety has been significantly correlated with agility, push-ups and step test repetitions in firefighters [<xref rid="B26-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the same study failed to show a significant relationship between state anxiety and performance variables (i.e., agility, power, strength and endurance), and trait anxiety was not related to power, and numerous other strength/endurance tasks.</p><p>The finding that no relationship exists between the severity of psychological distress and physical performance in firefighters is noteworthy, but further exploration into this area is crucial for ensuring the safety and well-being of firefighters. Current literature is mixed on this topic with some studies showing select psychological variables to be directly related to physical fitness or performance and others showing no relationship. A recent study highlighted that firefighters&#x02019; exercise intensity preference predicted significant variance in cardiovascular endurance, muscular endurance and ability in recruit firefighters [<xref rid="B12-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Further, numerous personality traits have been correlated with performance variables in firefighters. Specifically, conscientiousness, self-efficacy and openness were significantly correlated with strength and endurance, while extraversion was significantly correlated with functional movement in firefighters in training [<xref rid="B27-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Interestingly, conscientiousness, openness and self-efficacy displayed a positive relationship with performance variables while extraversion was negatively correlated with functional movement. That is, individuals who scored higher in conscientiousness, openness and self-efficacy reported more positive performance outcomes, while individuals higher in extraversion experienced decreased functional movement [<xref rid="B27-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Extraversion has also been negatively correlated with muscular endurance in recruit firefighters [<xref rid="B12-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is interesting as extraversion has typically been associated with an increase in exercise frequency and intensity [<xref rid="B28-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Other studies have failed to identify any relationship between psychological variables and performance outcomes. A recent systematic review was unsuccessful at finding a single study looking at emotional or psychological variables associated with the Firefighter Physical Ability Test [<xref rid="B29-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While this was a specific performance test, and other studies have examined psychological variables and physiological outcomes in firefighters, this review highlights a gap in the literature. Kim et al. showed that the amount of weekly physical activity may play a role in mental health in the general population [<xref rid="B30-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Self-reports of mental health and hours of physical activity per week were collected and analyzed from 7674 adults during the 2008 U.S. Health Information National Trends 2007 Survey. The results revealed a dose&#x02013;response relationship with 2.5 to 7.5 h of physical activity per week being the optimal volume for mental health benefits and poorer mental health with volumes less or greater than that range [<xref rid="B30-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, high volumes of physical activity may lead to improved physical fitness but not improved mental health. Repeating this study in firefighters may be beneficial to determine if the volume of weekly physical activity is playing a role on their mental health versus only assessing their physical fitness levels. Further, a recent review highlights the reciprocal relationship between resilience, PTSD symptomology, depression and anxiety in firefighters [<xref rid="B31-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The relationships between resilience, psychological well-being and physiological outcomes in firefighters are clearly complex and warrant further investigation.</p><p>Finally, as firefighters are often exposed to traumatic events, occupational stress, and significant environmental risk factors, it was predicted that they would show a strong interrelation between anxiety, depression and PTSD symptomology. Specifically, it was hypothesized that each of these separate but related psychological conditions would be predictive of each other in firefighters. The results of the present study support this hypothesis. Trait anxiety, state anxiety, depressive symptoms and PTSD symptoms were all significantly correlated with each other. Further, trait anxiety scores predicted 68 percent, 62 percent and 36 percent unique variance in state anxiety, depressive symptoms and PTSD symptoms, respectively, in firefighters. State anxiety predicted 59 percent and 42 percent unique variance in depressive symptoms and PTSD symptoms, respectively, while depressive symptoms predicted 35 percent unique variance in PTSD symptoms. Overall, these results support the current literature and make sense logically as anxiety, depression and PTSD share common risk factors, exhibit symptom overlap, often occur comorbidly, may have a cyclical effect on one another and are exacerbated in high-stress environments (i.e., firefighting).</p><p>Prevalence rates for individuals living with PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder vary but are significantly higher in firefighters relative to the general population. The prevalence of PTSD symptoms in firefighters has been reported with rates ranging from 6.5% to 37% [<xref rid="B32-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], relative to a lifetime prevalence of 5 percent in the general population [<xref rid="B34-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, a recent report highlights the prevalence of anxiety and depression in firefighters to be significantly greater than the general population. More than 12 percent of firefighters met the criteria for anxiety, compared to only 6 percent of the general population, while just under 10 percent met the criteria for depression, in contrast to about 3 percent of the general population [<xref rid="B35-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Furthermore, approximately 70 percent of firefighters with anxiety also met the criteria for depression, 27 percent with anxiety met the criteria for PTSD and 24 percent with depression met the criteria for PTSD [<xref rid="B35-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In a sample of 200 firefighters, 57 percent met full DSM-IV criteria for PTSD symptoms; PTSD symptoms were significantly correlated with anxiety and depression, and between 44 and 54 percent of firefighters with PTSD also met the criteria for anxiety and depression [<xref rid="B36-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Overall, firefighters are at an increased risk of PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms. It appears that all three psychological conditions are linked, and individuals who experience symptoms of one are more likely to experience symptoms of the others. Thus, it follows that firefighters who experience a decrease in the symptoms of one psychological condition are likely to experience a decrease in other psychological conditions. It is important to further explore these topics and come up with specific interventions to decrease symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety in firefighters, as all are separate mental health conditions.</p><p>The present study is not without limitations. First, the sample of firefighters reported relatively low levels of anxiety, depression and PTSD symptomology. The average PCL-5 score was 11.18, and according to Weathers et al., scores of 33 or higher have been proposed as a potential threshold for a probable diagnosis [<xref rid="B13-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The average trait anxiety and state anxiety scores were about 38 and 37, respectively. With a possible range of 20 to 80, scores between 20 and 37 are classified as &#x0201c;no or low anxiety&#x0201d;, scores from 38 to 44 are classified as &#x0201c;moderate anxiety&#x0201d; and scores from 45 to 80 are categorized as &#x0201c;high anxiety&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B37-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The present sample was on the low end. Finally, the average score on the BDI was 9.22, which falls under the classification of &#x0201c;normal ups and downs&#x0201d;, which is the lowest (i.e., least symptomatic) classification of depression [<xref rid="B38-jfmk-10-00142" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This is somewhat surprising as firefighters typically experience elevated anxiety, depression and PTSD, and limits the generalizability of the present results. Overall, the present sample has lower levels of anxiety, depression and PTSD symptomology, which may limit the generalizability of the study to other populations and professions. However, the relationships between psychological variables remained strong. It would be valuable to explore how psychological conditions predict physiological outcomes in a sample of firefighters with elevated or clinically significant levels of distress. Next, the present study did not explore mediation effects or cause-and-effect relationships. The primary aim was to examine the correlations among psychological variables and between psychological and physiological outcomes. A strength of the present study was its examination of psychological and physiological variables; however, future research is needed to deepen our understanding of these complex interactions and the mechanisms driving change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-jfmk-10-00142"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Overall, the results of this correlational, cross-sectional study support previous research in that dispositional resilience continues to be a significant predictor of serious psychological conditions/symptoms (i.e., depression, PTSD, state and trait anxiety) in firefighters. That is, firefighters with greater dispositional resilience exhibit significantly lower symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD. Interestingly, these relationships were shown in firefighters with low levels of PTSD, depression and anxiety relative to both the general population and other first responders/firefighters. Additionally, the results revealed no significant relationships between psychological variables and fitness outcomes, except for a notable association between the BDI and the number of push-ups completed. While this goes against the original hypothesis, it might be worth exploring these relationships in a sample of firefighters with elevated anxiety, depression and PTSD symptomology. It may be that only elevated psychological distress is associated with fitness decrements. While most psychological variables were not significantly correlated to fitness outcomes, every assessment was in the hypothesized direction. That is, higher resilience and lower scores on anxiety, depression and PTSD symptomology were associated with more positive fitness outcomes (i.e., increased push-ups and plank hold, decreased 1.5 mile run time). Due to the cross-sectional design of the current study, establishing causality and generalizability is challenging, particularly given the low baseline psychological distress. Nevertheless, the findings support the use of resilience measures as a potential risk factor for firefighters. In other words, individuals with lower dispositional resilience may be more vulnerable to the negative psychological effects commonly linked to firefighting. Therefore, implementing interventions to boost dispositional resilience in firefighters with lower baseline scores could be beneficial. Future work is needed to fully understand the relationships between psychological variables and fitness outcomes in firefighters.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
