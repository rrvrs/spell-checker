Introduction</title><p>The animal submandibular gland (SMG) is a salivary gland composed of both acini and ducts glands. The acini mainly secrete saliva, which contains inorganic salts, water, mucins, globulins, and salivary amylase, mainly affecting the moistening of the oral cavity, assisting in the digestion of food, defending against microbial infections, and playing an important role in regulating the microenvironment of the animal&#x02019;s rumen [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Otherwise, the ducts are responsible for producing the biologically active substances that regulate physiological activity via blood circulation. More than 30 active peptides have been found to be secreted by the SMG, such as EGF, and EGFR were essential for maintaining the normal function and metabolic activities of the gastric mucosa and intestinal tract [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. EGF is a heat-resistant single-chain low-molecule polypeptide composed of 53 amino acid residues, which are mainly synthesized by SMGs and the duodenum, widely exist in liquids such as breast milk, saliva, urine, intestinal fluids, blood, amniotic fluid, and glands [<xref rid="B2-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Studies have shown that EGF is associated with the transport of nutrients such as sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>), magnesium ions (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), inorganic phosphorus, glucose, glutamine, and other nutrients, which play an important role in the promotion of animal growth and the improvement of animal performance [<xref rid="B3-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. EGFR is a kind of multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity and high affinity for EGF and is widely distributed in various epithelial cell membranes [<xref rid="B4-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. EGF binds to EGFR on target cells and forms a dimer, which activates casein kinase and a series of signalling pathways through self-phosphorylation, induces epithelial cell growth, participates in cell proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis, and regulates endocrine secretion and tissue repair, etc. [<xref rid="B2-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The SMG is the main source of rumen fluid that helps the ruminants undergo microbial fermentation. EGF and EGFR play important biological activities in the oral and rumen internal environment in ruminants [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Our previous studies have shown that the submandibular glands of Tibetan sheep were dominated by serous acinar glands, EGF was mainly distributed in the striated ducts, and the binding site of EGF and EGFR was mainly at the basement membrane of the striated ducts, playing a role in the proliferation of serous acini cells and secretion [<xref rid="B5-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Further research found that yak SMGs secreted more acidic mucin and EGF compared to yellow cattle in the same pasture area, which could improve the rumen microenvironment and the decomposition of crude fibre in highland forage [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The Bactrian camel is highly adaptable to the desert, with adaptability to cold, drought, saline environments, and the obvious temperature difference between day and night [<xref rid="B6-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Bactrian camels have a higher salivary viscosity than other domestic animals, which contributes to enhancing the rumen microenvironment and facilitating the adaptation of the rumen to the unique digestive mechanism in desert environments [<xref rid="B7-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The Bactrian camel SMG is a mixed gland. We analysed the histochemical characteristics of the SMG by transmission electron microscopy, special staining, and the expression of EGF and EGFR, which will provide a reference for the research on the physiological functions of the Bactrian camel.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vetsci-12-00108"><title>2.

Results</title><p>The SMG is encased in a fascial sheath formed by the deep cervical fascia, located between the mandible and the hyoid tongue muscle. Overall, the SMG is a kind of tubular vesicular gland that consists of the acini and the ducts. The anatomical nomenclature of the SMG morphology, its macrophage, plasma cells, collagen fibres, and reticular fibres are in accordance with Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria [<xref rid="B9-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><sec id="sec3dot1-vetsci-12-00108"><title>3.1. Histological Observations of the Submandibular Gland of the Bactrian Camel</title><p>We observed the SMG of Bactrian camels using HE staining and found that it is composed of ducts and acini. The vertical longitudinal lines can be seen at the base of the striated tube cells, which consist of simple columnar and cuboidal cells. The intercalated ducts are composed of single, flattened epithelial cells with spindle-shaped or ellipsoid nuclei. The acinus includes mucinous and serous acini. The mucinous acini exhibit light-coloured cytoplasm and rounded nuclei positioned at the base of the vesicle, whereas the serous acini display a darker appearance with oval nuclei, also located at the base of the vesicle. The distal end of the mucinous acini is capped by serous cells, forming a half-moon structure (demilune cells) (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a). The PAS staining revealed positive purplish-red expressed in the serous acini and demilune cells, with weak positivity observed on the luminal surface of the striated ducts (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>b). The AB staining demonstrated that the positive blue was expressed primarily in the mucous vesicles and on the luminal surface of the striated ducts (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>c). The AB-PAS staining exhibited positive blue expression on the luminal surface of mucous vesicles and striated ducts; however, no significant expression was observed in the demilune cells or intercalated ducts (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>d). The collagen fibres were predominantly distributed surrounding the striated and intercalated ducts (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>e). The reticular fibres were abundantly expressed sparsely around mucinous vesicles (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>f).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-vetsci-12-00108"><title>3.2. Ultrastructural Observation of the Submandibular Gland of the Bactrian Camel</title><p>Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the plasma cells (PC) contained a substantial amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum, which was tightly arranged in parallel, and the interstitium was filled with amorphous material and contained a small number of lysosomes; the nuclear chromatin was notably abundant and arranged in a whorled pattern. The macrophage (M&#x003c6;) nuclei displayed an irregular shape, and the cytoplasm was characterized by the presence of vacuoles and lysosomes (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a,b).</p><p>Transmission electron microscopy revealed that serous acini exhibited large, round nuclei containing a substantial amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum and secretory granules in the cytoplasm. The basement membranes of the acini were closely associated with continuous capillaries, characterized by a complex infolding of the plasma membrane and the presence of large vesicle-like structures within the capillary endothelial cells (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a). The intercellular tubules located at the base of the demilune cells exhibited distinct microvilli, while the serous acinar cells contained numerous mitochondria and an extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum, along with secretory granules of varying sizes, which could be classified as either mature secretory granules (MSGs) or immature secretory granules (ISGs) based on their differing electron densities (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b). At a magnification of 4000&#x000d7;, the serous acinar cells have a high density of mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum, in addition to a junctional complex that includes tight junctions, intermediate junctions, and desmosomes, facilitating their connection to mucinous cells (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>c). When observed at 1500&#x000d7; magnification, the striatal ducts are distinguished by the vertically arranged mitochondria and infolded plasma membranes at the basal cytoplasm, characterized by small nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratios (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>d). Surrounding the striated duct were small blood vessels (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>e). The epithelium of the striated ducts was interconnected via a junctional complex composed of gap junctions, adherens junctions, and tight junctions; moreover, a significant presence of microvilli was observed at its basal region (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>f).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-vetsci-12-00108"><title>3.3. Comparative Immunohistochemical Analysis of the Bactrian Camel Submandibular Gland</title><p>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a strong positive expression of EGF predominantly in the striated ducts, a positive expression in the intercalated ducts, and an absence of expression in the acini of the SMG of the Bactrian camel (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a). EGFR had predominant positive expression in both striated and intercalated ducts, with no expression detected in the acini (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b). There were no expressions in the negative control (<xref rid="vetsci-12-00108-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>c).

Discussion</title><sec id="sec4dot1-vetsci-12-00108"><title>4.1. Histochemical Characteristics of Submandibular Glands of the Bactrian Camel</title><p>Salivary glands are abundant with mucin and zymogen granules, primarily synthesising and secreting salivary amylase, which is thinner and clearer in nature and possesses unique digestive and biological functions [<xref rid="B10-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The SMG serves as the primary source of saliva in ruminants, consisting of ducts and acini. The ducts consist of intercalated ducts, striated ducts, and excretory ducts, whereas the acini are predominantly mixed acini with a smaller number of serous acini and mucinous acini. Zhou J et al. [<xref rid="B11-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] demonstrated that the number of secretory cells increases with the development of salivary glands by AB and PAS staining techniques. Yang Jie et al. [<xref rid="B5-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] observed that the mucinous acini of SMG from Tibetan sheep and big-tail sheep exhibited positive purplish-red coloration with PAS staining, whereas AB-PAS staining revealed bluish-purple expression in mixed acini along with slightly bluish demilune cells, striated ducts, and intercalated ducts. Furthermore, Yang et al. [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] discovered that yak SMGs secrete more acidic mucous substances to regulate the pH of rumen fluid for enhanced decomposition of the coarse fibres present in forage. The Bactrian camel inhabits desert regions, characterized by significant temperature fluctuations between day and night. Among the three glandular sac regions within their forestomach, those containing glandular lamina propria are classified as mucous glands dominated by acidic-mucin-secreting mucous cells [<xref rid="B12-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], playing a crucial role in host defence mechanisms as well as maintaining a healthy microbial environment [<xref rid="B13-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Notably, glycosylation of mucins secreted by serous or mixed acini has been found to be particularly vital for gut microflora [<xref rid="B14-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this study, the SMG of the Bactrian camel predominantly consisted of mixed acini, with serous and mixed acini secreting glycogen and neutral mucin. The mucinous acini and striated ducts primarily contained acidic mucous substances. Semi-quantitative analysis revealed that the area occupied by mucinous acini was larger than that of serous acini, indicating a greater secretion of acidic mucus substances through striated and intercalated ducts into the forestomach during feeding and rumination. This secretion may play a significant role in rumen microbial decomposition and will contribute to the adaptability of the Bactrian camel to harsh environments and their high tolerance for roughage.</p><p>The collagen fibrils are the major mechanical component in the extracellular matrix of a broad range of multicellular animals from echinoderms to vertebrates where they provide a stable framework for tissues [<xref rid="B15-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The fibrous components of the extracellular matrix can be morphologically categorized into the collagen fibre system and the microfibrillar elastin system [<xref rid="B16-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that collagen fibres not only enhance tissue and organ stiffness while maintaining structural integrity but also possess growth control and immunomodulatory effects [<xref rid="B17-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Reticular fibre primarily consists of type III collagen, which exhibits certain elasticity and widespread distribution throughout the body. Together with collagen fibres, they contribute to the formation of fibrous network scaffolds crucial for maintaining tissue appearance and stiffness [<xref rid="B18-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this study, we observed a predominant distribution of collagen fibres around the intercalated and striated ducts. Additionally, a small amount of collagen fibres were found surrounding acini to preserve acini structure integrity. Reticular fibres were abundant in acini peripheries as well as ducts; even mucinous acini contained some reticular fibres. These findings suggest that the reticular and collagen fibres play a significant supportive role between acini and ducts.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-vetsci-12-00108"><title>4.2. Transmission Electron Microscopy Characteristics of the Submandibular Gland of Bactrian Camels</title><p>The function of the conduit system in SMG includes absorbing sodium and discharging potassium, transporting moisture, etc. Redman et al. [<xref rid="B19-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] discovered that the streak formations on the basal of striated ducts cells consist of mitochondria and folded plasma membrane structures, which increases the surface area of the cell base, facilitating the transport of water and electrolytes between the cell and tissue fluid, such as Na+-ATPase and K+-ATPase involved in liquid and ion transport, indicating that striated tubes can modulate saliva acidity&#x02013;alkalinity through selective reabsorption and electrolyte secretion [<xref rid="B20-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that the cytoskeletal system, composed of microfilaments in striated ductal wall cells, plays a role in promoting the contraction of ductal cells to enhance salivary secretion [<xref rid="B21-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consistent with this finding, our study reveals that the cytoskeletal system constructed by microfilaments and mitochondria in SMGs was significantly increased in the striated ducts, which played a major role in the reabsorption and transport of saliva. Fletcher et al. [<xref rid="B22-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] discovered that spindle-shaped myoepithelial cells present in the striated ducts possess mechanical stabilization capabilities and contribute to striated duct contraction mechanisms. Our electron microscopic analysis revealed the close adherence between spindle-shaped myoepithelial cells and the luminal surface of striated ducts assisting in the efficient expulsion of saliva. ZHOU et al. [<xref rid="B11-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] proposed that the junction complex between ductal cells composed of desmosomes, intermediate junctions, and tight junctions serves as a fundamental element for glandular function. Lee et al. [<xref rid="B23-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] demonstrated that the perforated capillaries in SMGs contribute to substance permeability and differentiation, and the development of acinar cells. In the present study, the connectivity complex between striated endothelial cells and the capillaries adjacent to the acini, facilitates the drainage of mucinous acini and ion-selective exchange. The antibodies generated by Pc can mediate humoral immunity [<xref rid="B24-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The Pc in the salivary gland microenvironment produces autoantibodies and is not dependent on B cell activation and differentiation [<xref rid="B25-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Kathrine Skarstein et al. [<xref rid="B26-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] demonstrated that plasma cells from patients with primary dry syndrome actively contribute to inflammation recovery in salivary glands [<xref rid="B26-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The M&#x000f8;, immune cells originating from bone marrow, are distributed across various tissues for phagocytosis and degradation of dead cells, debris, and foreign substances while coordinating inflammatory processes [<xref rid="B27-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. M&#x000f8; plays a pivotal role during tissue injury repair by participating in the initiation, maintenance, and regression phases [<xref rid="B28-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, the typical structural characteristics of Pc and M&#x000f8; may significantly contribute to maintaining stability in the Bactrian camel&#x02019;s SMG microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-vetsci-12-00108"><title>4.3. Comparison of EGF and EGFR Expression Analyses in the Submandibular Gland of the Bactrian Camel</title><p>The SMG synthesises various cytokines and enzymes, and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) is one of the important bioactive polypeptides. The EGF promotes cell growth and facilitates the proliferation, morphogenesis, and migration of SMG cells [<xref rid="B29-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Excision of SMGs in rats significantly reduces the thickness of both gastric mucosa and sinus mucosa [<xref rid="B30-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], while oral administration of EGF leads to a significant increase in gastric wall mucosa thickness in suckling rats, indicating that EGF is an essential trophic factor for the gastric mucosa [<xref rid="B31-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. EGFR is a receptor for EGF and plays a crucial role in EGF-stimulated growth [<xref rid="B32-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The localization of EGFR varies among mammalian salivary glands; however, activation of EGFR induces mucin production [<xref rid="B33-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In vitro cell culture studies show that the EGF regulates Ca<sup>+</sup> concentration and cAMP levels to promote proliferation in rat SMG ductal cells. Additionally, EGFR regulates morphological changes in salivary gland branches by promoting epithelial cell proliferation and maturation while supporting intercellular cell survival [<xref rid="B34-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In Tibetan sheep and big-tail sheep SMGs, EGF and EGFR mainly bind in the basement membrane of striate ducts and play a role in the proliferation and secretion of serous acinar cells [<xref rid="B5-vetsci-12-00108" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this study, immunofluorescence colocalization experiment analysis revealed the strong positive expression of EGF and EGFR in striated ducts as well as intercalated ducts in Bactrian camel SMG. It is suggested that EGF and EGFR are secreted and combined in striated and intercalated ducts. Since these ducts are responsible for substance transport, they may improve the transport efficiency and secretion of substances. The mechanism of the impact needs to be further investigated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vetsci-12-00108"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the SMG of the Bactrian camel can secrete higher levels of acid mucin, EGF, and other bioactive substances which contribute to enhancing the rumen microenvironment and facilitating the adaptation of the rumen to the unique digestive mechanism in desert environments. EGF and EGFR are primarily secreted in the ductal system of the SMG, and the mechanisms underlying the improvement of transport efficiency and substance secretion require further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences for their technical assistance in TEM; the State Key Laboratory of Aridland Crop Science for the technical support of this experiment, and Yawen Chen, Lixiang Cheng, and Yongmei Zhang for their help with this experiment.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
