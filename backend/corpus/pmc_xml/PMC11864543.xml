We describe characteristics of PWID, and associated risk behaviour, to inform the designing of programmes that are tailored to clients&#x02019; needs and preferences. A cross-sectional survey (August 23<sup>rd</sup> to December 5<sup>th</sup>, 2023) in Kampala interviewed 354 PWID (&#x02265;18-years) at selected venues(bars,lodges, street corners and ghetto). Peer eductors and counsellors administered a structured questionnaire covering socio-demographics, drug use, sexual risk, and medical history. HIV serostatus was determined by self-report or testing for consenting participants without history of recent testing Binary logistic regression was used to establish the relationship between HIV infection and risky drug- and sexual behaviour of PWID. Participants were predominantly Ugandan (95.2%), male (73.2%), unmarried (55.9%), unemployed (81.8%), with higher levels of education and varying ages. Mental disorders were prevalent, with 48.7% reporting at least one underlying condition, including depression (30.8%) and anxiety (9.6%). Physical health issues included fever (32.9%), cough (32.5%), malaria (22%), and sexually transmitted infections (15%). Over 82.6% were introduced to drugs by close acquaintances. HIV prevalence among participants was 3.7%, higher in females (8.4%) and non-Ugandans (16.7%). Being female and experiencing difficulty accessing sterile injection materials were associated with HIV-positive status. Our study provides valuable insight into the socio-demographic, mental, physical health, and HIV risk behaviour of PWID in Kampala, Uganda. The findings indicate significant vulnerabilities to injecting drug use, mental disorders, and high-risk behaviors that predispose this population to HIV infection. Despite a low HIV prevalence in this population compared to previous estimates, the interplay between drug use, risky injecting practices, and sexual behaviour suggests an urgent need for targeted interventions to address these intertwined challenges.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports that illicit drug use increased by 23% from 240 million in 2011 to 296 million in 2021, of whom 13.2 million people were injecting drugs[<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Louisa Degenhardt et al (2023) estimated that 14&#x000b7;8 million people are drug injectors in the 190 countries that contribute more than 99% of the global population[<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The rising burden of illicit drug use including injecting and challenges related to its regulation, continues to harm the economic, health, and social sectors [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The high prevalence of HIV and Hepatitis B and C infections in sub-Saharan Africa has in part been attributed to thesobserved increase in injection drug use [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This problem is compounded by a high occurrence of infectious diseases, as well as a myriad of socio-demographic, mental health, and other general physical health issues among PWID. Studies have reported injection drug users to be mainly men, not married, unemployed, often young with varied education levels, and prone to high risk of sexual and social crime [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Concurrent mental disorders with Opioid use disorder (OUD) also present a dual burden for PWID. A high prevalence of depression and anxiety among people with OUD was reported in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However the prevalence of mental disorders among PWID varies widely based on the method of ascertainment [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A recent study indicated that the prevalence of depressive disorders varied from as low as 3&#x000b7;44% to a high 66% in the general population [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In Uganda, an estimated 7,356 people are injecting drug users, with an HIV prevalence of 16% compared to 5.6% in the general adult population. Hence injecting drugs is the second highest contributor to new infections among key populations in the country[<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Critical attention is needed to reduce HIV transmission among PWID and other key populations. Uganda adopted the WHO/UNODC recommended HIV prevention interventions for PWID as outlined in the national strategic plan [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Working with the Ministry of Health, the Uganda Harm Reduction Network (UHRN), the Global Fund and UN health development partners supported a project that distributed clean needles and syringes in Kampala and Mbale cities [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In 2020, with PEPFAR support, Uganda set up the first medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) clinic at a psychiatric hospital in Kampala city</p><p>Hitherto another clinic, has been established in Mbale city in the eastern part of the country. Despite these efforts, the scope of service and geographical reach of HIV prevention, care, and treatment services for PWID is far from realising the targeted 90%. The barriers to optimally reaching PWID with such services have previously been described to act at multiple levels including social, physical, economic or political [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Key barriers include; stigma, peer influence, criminalising of drug use, lack of transport to the service points, comorbidities such as mental disorders, limited knowledge of available services, and limited capacity to provide services[<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>There is a need to improve service delivery by offering differentiated harm reduction services based on client needs and preferences. This requires understanding the risk profiles of PWID regarding their socio-demographics, drug use, risk behaviour, and criminal and mental health among others. PWID risk profiles are heterogeneous and given the limited resources, tailored services based on PWID needs and preferences are required [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In Uganda, evidence on the relationship between PWID&#x02019; characteristics and their risk of HIV infection is still limited. Earlier studies were primarily exploratory with small sample sizes and did not fully captured the variations in participants&#x02019; characteristics related to their risk of HIV infection and access to HIV prevention services [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Knowledge of the varying profiles of PWID is crucial for the implementation and uptake of risk reduction interventions. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of PWID, physical and mental health, and HIV risk behaviour to inform the design of programs that are tailored to client&#x02019;s needs and preferences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design &#x00026; setting</title><p>This cross-sectional survey was implemented from August 23<sup>rd</sup> 2023 to December 5<sup>th</sup> 2023 at selected venues (bars, lodges, street corners and ghettos) in Kampala City.

Recruitment within the community utilised peer educators who mobilized participants to participate in the study. Interviewed participants were encouraged to refer other users within their network, helping the study to achieve an adequate sample size.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Data collection</title><p>The data were collected using a structured questionnaire and keyed directly into open data kit (ODK) database software[<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The questionnaire was piloted among PWID attending the MOUD clinic at Butabika National Referral Mental Hospital. The MOUD clinic staff were trained to collect data. Two additional peers were recruited and trained to mobilize venue owners and participants to support and participate in the study respectively. During visits to the hotspot or drop-in centers, the data collectors administered the questionnaire in the participant&#x02019;s preferred language. The data were entered directly into the ODK, where the data manager provided the quality control feedback for redress by data collectors.</p><p>To increase the likelihood of participation, we leveraged existing social networks, encouraging initial participants who would be willing to participate in the study. We prioritised flexible scheduling of interviews to accommodate the participant&#x02019;s availability while considering their mental status, work schedules, treatment appointments, and other commitments. Due to legal restrictions and the potential risk of arrest, accessing PWID posed significant challenges [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, we prioritised the safety and well-being of both participants and data collectors. Throughout the data collection process, participants were assured of their safety and the confidentiality of their information. They were also informed about the importance of their participation in the study for informing public health interventions.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Study measurements</title><p>Participants&#x02019; sociodemographic characteristics included age, sex assigned at birth, religion, nationality, education level, monthly income, and source. Regarding substance use, participants were asked which substances they often used/injected in the previous 30 days, the lifetime duration of use, reasons for use/injection, and the frequency of use/injection. Questions on the frequency and use of flashblood, sharing needles/syringes, and frequency of experiencing overdose were asked to establish the injection risk behaviour. Sexual risk behaviour was assessed by asking about the sexual encounters (vaginal or anal) with non-regular partners and condom use in the last 30 days. Participants were considered to have consistently used condoms if they used condoms for all times during all the sexual encounters. Sexual risk was also assessed by asking participants if they had sex with someone else in exchange for money, drugs, or any other commodity as the term for payment. Physical illness in the past three months and screening for HIV, TB, and hepatitis were also assessed. Those who reported being HIV positive and had their status confirmed from clinical records were not required to undergo additional testing. For others, HIV status was determined using the Determine&#x02122; HIV-1/2 rapid test, with confirmation via the Bioline HIV1/2 3.0 rapid test, following national guidelines [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The state of mental illness was assessed through self-reporting, asking if particpants were or had been on treatment for a mental health condition. Sexual gender-based violence (SGBV) was evaluated by asking if a participant had ever been forced to have sexual intercourse. Other factors assessed included the history and frequency of incarceration.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Baseline socio-demographic, mental, and physical health-related, drug use behaviors and sexual risk profiles were summarised using medians and interquartile ranges for numerical variables and proportions for categorical variables.

In multivariate logistic analysis level, we adjusted for confounding using the backward stepwise method based on p-values, removing most non-significant variables and interaction terms from the model until only significant variables remained. The variables with p-values &#x0003c;0.05 were reported as significantly associated with HIV status. Adjusted Odds ratios (AORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported.

Over nine in ten were Ugandans and seven in ten had ever been imprisoned. Peer influence was cited by seven in ten participants as a key determinant of drug use. Additionally, seven in ten had injected drugs in the last three months, with half reporting at least one mental health problem. One in three reported experiencing fever or cough in the last three months. Risky behaviour was common, with one in ten reporting syringe and needle sharing. A half had sex with non-regular partners, but only a third used condoms. Three-quarters engaged in transactional sex, yet only seven in ten knew their HIV status, with a positivity rate of 3.7%, higher among females and non-Ugandan nationals. Females and those with difficulty accessing sterile injection materials were more likely to be HIV positive.</p><p>Our results are comparable to an earlier descriptive studies in Uganda, that found PWID to be predominatly male, not married, with some earning a living through sex work [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similar findings have been reported in other regions, highlighting the vulnerability of unemployed and economically disadvantaged populations to injecting drug use [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The UNODC resource guide on counselling in targeted intervention for injecting drug users, emphasizes the importance of understanding the characterisitics of IDU, for the successful management of opioid use disorder. Further noting that IDUs are often the most vulnerable, underprivileged subgroup of the community, mainly men in their productive years, not in gainful employment due to intoxication, and frequent absenteeism at work. Similarly, reports from low- and middle-income Countries observed that injecting drug users were primarily men, unmarried, Christian, and unemployed [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although the gender gap in drug use is narrowing, our findings suggest otherwise that men in Uganda and possibly similar resource-limited settings shoulder a large portion of the drug injection burden [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Peer influence was prominently cited as a predisposing factor for drug use, likely associated with the younger participants, as over 70% were below 35 years old. Young people often influence or imitate each other to demonstrate a sense of belonging. Indeed, eight out of ten participants reported that either friends or relatives introduced them to drug use. Similarly, a study among university students aged below 25 years found that nine out of ten participants identified peer influence as the main determinant of psychoactive substance use [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><sec id="sec019"><title>Mental health</title><p>We found a high self-reported occurrence of mental health disorders, coupled with limited access to treatment services. Nearly half of the participants reported a diagnosis of co-existing mental disorder, with only one in ten receiving treatment. Depression, Anxiety, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder were the most prevalent co-morbidities. Schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The prevalence of mental disorders in this study was high compared to what was found in a systematic review of 24 studies from Uganda, which reported a prevalence of 24.2%, in adults [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the same review, the combined prevalence of anxiety disorders and depressive disorders was approximately one in four adults. Globally, the prevalence of mental disorders has been found to vary widely based on the method of ascertainment, with recent studies reporting a prevalence of depressive disorders varying from as low as 3&#x000b7;4% to a high 66% in the general population [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite potential social desirability bias associated with self-reported data, our findings suggest that the escalating injecting drug use is likely exacerbating the ongoing mental health crisis in Uganda. Diagnosing mental disorders can be challenging, particularly in low-resource settings like Uganda where the inadequate human resources to address the growing mental disorder and drug use disorder burden are limited [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The signs and symptoms of acute intoxication and withdrawal syndrom are similar to those of other psychiatric disorders, complicating the accurate diagnosis of these conditions. Furthermore, mental disorders can be risk factors for and can exacerbate, substance use, and vice-versa, creating a complex interplay between the two [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This interplay highlights the need for integrated approaches to address both mental health disorders and opioid use disorders in Uganda.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Physical health profiles</title><p>Injecting drug users face a significant burden of physical health issues, including infectious diseases such as malaria, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV. The reported prevalence of malaria treatment (22%) is consistent with the high malaria burden in Uganda, as the leading cause of morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The prevalence of STIs (15%) underscores the intersection of substance use and sexual health risks among this population. These findings align with other studies, which have similarly reported elevated rates of STIs, HIV and other communicable diseases, among people who use drugs. The high vulnerability has been associated with some factors including high-risk sexual behaviors associated with drug use, limitations in accessing healthcare services, and hygiene practices, among others [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The presence of tuberculosis (TB) and skin diseases among participants highlights the broader health challenges faced by PWID [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Overall, these findings emphasize the need for integrated healthcare interventions that address both infectious and non-communicable diseases among injecting users in Uganda and similar settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>HIV prevalence</title><p>The prevalence of HIV among injecting drug users was 3.7%, far less than the estimated 33% reported by the Uganda AIDS Commission and Uganda Ministry of Health [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However the recent crane survey and two other studies reported that the HIV prevalence among PWID in Uganda ranged between 3.6% to 17% [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our earlier study reported an HIV-positive rate (8.8%) among injecting drug users enrolled in the Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) program, where participants underwent routine HIV testing every three months.</p><p>The low prevalence may be attributed to the low frequency of injecting drug use in this population, which is largely due to the unaffordability of accessing injecting drugs and related paraphernalia[<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Futher still, even with the low prevalence reported, the four times higher HIV Prevalence among females than males, is consistent with studies in Tanzania where the HIV-positive sero-status was three times higher in females compared to males [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Risky injection practices and sexual behaviour contribute to the heightened risk of HIV transmission among injecting drug users[<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Sharing of injecting equipment and engaging in unprotected sexual encounters with non-regular partners were common. The high frequency of transactional sex and the use of drugs before sexual encounters further compound the risk of HIV transmission. The prevalent stigma contributing to low HIV status awareness (with only one in five injecting drug users aware of their status) also suggests inadequate coverage of HIV prevention services.38[<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. At the time of data collection, only one MOUD clinic existed in Kampala city. There remains urgent need to expand harm reduction services, including HIV testing, to reach more injecting drug users in Uganda.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Risk factors for HIV infection</title><p>Although most participants were found to be occasional injectors, risky drug injection and sexual practices were common, posing a significant potential for transmitting and increasing the number of new HIV infections. Reported risky injection practices included sharing needles and syringes, sharing mixing equipment, flushing blood, and reusing syringes multiple times.These findings reinforce earlier reports from studies in Uganda [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Prevoius studies associated prevalent drug risk behavior with the unaffordability of new syringes and the nadir existence of harm reduction programs in Uganda. Regarding to risky sexual practices, over half of the participants reported having sex with a nonregular partner, three of ten reported inconsistent condom use, and over two-thirds of the participants were engaging in transactional sex. These factors heighten the vulnerability of PWID to HIV infection [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. While taking drugs before sex was associated with an increased risk of HIV, this association was not significant in multivariate, similar to other sexual risk factors. A previous study by the Community Health Alliance Uganda (CHAU) examined discussed three main HIV risk perspectives: impaired judgment leading to unprotected sex, frequent sexual encounters with non-regular partners, and reduced libido due to drug use, which lowers sexual activity[<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Additionally, people who inject drugs may be forced to sell sex to acquire money to buy drugs [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In our study, nearly seven in ten of those who had multiple sexual encounters, paid money or other commodities in exchange of sex with another person, and nearly half reported having had sex in exchange for drugs.</p><p>Another crucial risk factor deserving attention is the status of being non-Ugandan, who were mostly refugees of recent immigration status. High proportions of non-Ugandans were found HIV positive but with no significant association in multivariate analysis. Studies conducted elsewhere in Dar-es-Salaam and the United States reported that recent immigrants had an increased risk of HIV infection [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This heightened risk among non-nationals may be attributed to various factors, including unawareness of safer needle use practices, financial constraints hindering the purchase of new needles, and exposure to circumstances that increase the likelihood of engaging in risky sex work.</p><p>The small sample size and missing data on key parameters may partially explain the failure to demonstrate an association between injection drug risk and the HIV status. Despite efforts to ensure the confidentiality and safety of participants during interviews, it was not uncommon for participants to decline to respond to particular essential questions or take an HIV test. Another factor that we didn&#x02019;t find significant was the frequency of injection; in Uganda, most drug users only injected occasionally. This affects the risk of exposure to HIV and programming for harm reduction interventions such as clean needle and syringe distribution. Nonetheless, our study finding reinforces current evidence on the relation between HIV serostatus, and injecting drug and sexual risk practices. Two studies conducted in Uganda found that participants reused syringes in some instances up to 2-4 times before disposal [<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003370.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Limitations</title><p>Selection bias may have emerged due to increased security enforcement in preparation for a Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit in Kampala, during January 2024, as it coincided with the data collection period. This security nforcement drove more PWID into hiding, reducing our access to some community members. Selecting initial seeds on a first-come basis likely favoured accessible or motivated individuals, leading to an unrepresentative sample. This may underrepresent those more stigmatised, severely addicted, or with poor health and less access to services, skewing results and underestimating the true prevalence of risk behaviour and mental and physical health conditions.</p><p>In some instances, participants declined to answer or did not respond to a question. Although this could have been because individuals deliberately preferred not to answer, we can&#x02019;t rule out the fact that cognitive impairments, mood disorders, or other mental health issues suffered by people suffering from opioid use disorder, could compromise the ability to recall and report information accurately.</p><p>Relying on self-reporting by participants could have introduced recall bias, as participants might not accurately remember past events or might selectively report on such events, leading to misrepresentation of the true measures. To minimize this bias, the questions were designed with a maximum recall duration of three months, pretested, and simplified to reduce cognitive load and facilitate easier recall of past events.</p><p>Additionally, interviews were rescheduled based on participants&#x02019; availability to enhance recall accuracy, avoid distractions, and allow for better concentration and memory recall. Furthermore, while measures were taken to ensure confidentiality and safety, the possibility of overreporting or underreporting drug and sexual risk behaviour remains, as participants may have been influenced by social desirability bias stemming from internal stigma. The extended data collection period(six months) allowed us to reach and enroll injecting drug users of different categories. Collecting data at community venues where most injecting drug users congregate helped ensure diversity. Using ODK-enabled real-time data correction, increasing accuracy. Based on these adjustments, we believe these results are valid and representative of injecting drug users in Kampala.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study provides valuable insight into the socio-demographic, mental, physical health, and HIV-associated risk of persons with drug user disorders in Kampala, Uganda. The findings indicate a significant vulnerability to injecting drug use, mental health disorders, and high-risk behaviour that predispose this population to HIV infection. Despite a low HIV prevalence compared to previous estimates, the interplay between drug use, risky injecting practices, and sexual behaviour suggests an urgent need for targeted interventions to address these intertwined challenges. Implementing a multi-sectoral approach that combines, harm reduction, physical healthcare, and mental health services is crucial for improving the well-being of persons who inject illicit drugs, and reducing the burden of HIV and other associated health issues in Uganda.</p></sec><sec id="sec025" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pgph.0003370.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>Inclusivity in global research.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgph.0003370.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0003370.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Dataset.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgph.0003370.s002.csv"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the Butabika National Referral Mental Hospital management, Uganda Harm Reduction Network, and MOUD clinic staff who participated in the data collection and cleaning.

Flaxman, Ph.D.</p><p>Academic Editor</p><p>PLOS Global Public Health</p><p>Journal Requirements:</p><p>1. Please ensure you have stated the type of consent (Written) in the Methods section of your manuscript text to fully comply with the PLOS ONE policy on reporting research involving human participants. This information is currently provided only in the Human Participants Research Checklist, which will not be published with your manuscript files.</p><p>2. Please include a complete copy of PLOS&#x02019; questionnaire on inclusivity in global research in your revised manuscript. Our policy for research in this area aims to improve transparency in the reporting of research performed outside of researchers&#x02019; own country or community. The policy applies to researchers who have travelled to a different country to conduct research, research with Indigenous populations or their lands, and research on cultural artefacts. The questionnaire can also be requested at the journal&#x02019;s discretion for any other submissions, even if these conditions are not met. Please find more information on the policy and a link to download a blank copy of the questionnaire here: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/best-practices-in-research-reporting" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/best-practices-in-research-reporting</ext-link>. Please upload a completed version of your questionnaire as Supporting Information when you resubmit your manuscript.</p><p>3. In the online submission form, you indicated that [The datasets analysed during the current study will be shared on reasonable request by the corresponding].&#x000a0;</p><p>All PLOS journals now require all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript to be freely available to other researchers, either&#x000a0;</p><p>a. In a public repository,&#x000a0;</p><p>b. Within the manuscript itself, or&#x000a0;</p><p>c. Uploaded as supplementary information.</p><p>This policy applies to all data except where public deposition would breach compliance with the protocol approved by your research ethics board. If your data cannot be made publicly available for ethical or legal reasons (e.g., public availability would compromise patient privacy), please explain your reasons by return email and your exemption request will be escalated to the editor for approval. Your exemption request will be handled independently and will not hold up the peer review process, but will need to be resolved should your manuscript be accepted for publication. One of the Editorial team will then be in touch if there are any issues.</p><p>4. Please provide separate figure files in .tif or .eps format.</p><p>For more information about figure files please see our guidelines:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/figures" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/figures</ext-link>&#x000a0;</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/figures#loc-file-requirements" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/figures#loc-file-requirements</ext-link>&#x000a0;</p><p>Additional Editor Comments (if provided):</p><p>[Note: HTML markup is below.

While focuses on an important topic, there are a few issues that the manuscript would benefit from addressing.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. HIV testing: There are two places in the manuscript that described the way HIV testing was done (&#x0201c;study measurements&#x0201d; section in the methods and &#x0201c;HIV prevalence&#x0201d; section in discussion), and they describe it in very different ways. This inconsistency needs to be resolved. Importantly, in the discussion section, they indicated that participants who self-reported a recent negative test (past 3 or 6 months? Timeframe is inconsistently written, too) did not undergo HIV rapid testing through the study. This is not a reliable way to estimate HIV prevalence. And indeed, the study found quite low HIV prevalence. With the ambiguity of HIV testing method, I am not sure about the validity of this finding.</p><p>2. Frequency of injection drug use, types of drugs injected and non-injection drug use: In &#x0201c;Drug use-related characteristics&#x0201d; section in the results, they report that 50% of their sample last injected drugs more than a month before the interview. This suggests that study participants are mostly very occasional injectors, and is not aligned with conventional characteristics of PWID discussed in the context of HIV/AIDS (i.e., usually people inject drugs on a much more frequent basis). Despite this, the authors do not discuss this point in the discussion section &#x02013; is it common in Uganda that people inject drugs so infrequently or is it just that the study did not reach those who engage in more intense injection drug use patterns?</p><p>Also, they do not report any types of drugs injected or non-injection drug use patterns. Without such information, they cannot claim that they are providing &#x0201c;a comprehensive insight&#x0201d; into the characteristics of PWID in Kampala. The low frequency of injection drug use may mean that those participants were engaged more in non-injection drug use.</p><p>3. Multivariable regression modeling procedure (statistical analysis section in the methods) is unclear. They stated that they included &#x0201c;variables that had p values &#x0003c;0.1 or known association with HIV serostatus, were selected for inclusion.&#x0201d; Which variables are the known association with HIV serostatus? Were variables that were not hypothesized to be associated with HIV serostatus but had p values &#x0003c;0.1 still included in the multivariable model? They should not.</p><p>4. In &#x0201c;Risk factors for HIV injection&#x0201d; in the discussion, the authors stated that: &#x0201c;The common risk drug injection practices reported include sharing needles and syringes, sharing mixing equipment, flushing blood, and reusing syringes multiple times.&#x0201d; But the prevalence of these behaviours was less than 10%. I don&#x02019;t think we call it &#x0201c;common&#x0201d; behaviour. Again, this raises a question about who the study sample was &#x02013; weren&#x02019;t they mostly drug smokers, not injectors?</p><p>5. &#x0201c;HIV Risk behavior&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Drug use and sexual-related HIV risk factors&#x0201d; sections in the results include some interpretation of the results (e.g., &#x0201c;&#x02026;was a significant concern&#x0201d;). Such interpretation should be removed from the results section and placed in the discussion section.</p><p>6. &#x0201c;Risk factors for HIV injection&#x0201d; in the discussion section includes a discussion of non-nationals, and the authors stated that: &#x0201c;The risk of being HIV positive was found to be</p><p>five times higher among non-nationals compared to Ugandans.&#x0201d; As the regression results did not show a statistically significant association and the 95% CI is very wide, this statement as well as the related discussion should be removed.</p><p>Minor comments</p><p>7. Introduction, 1st para: &#x0201c;The rising burden of drug use including injecting, continues to harm the economic, health, and social sectors(1).&#x0201d; This sentence is misleading and should be revised. It is not the drug use per se that harms the society, but the way drug use is regulated and viewed in the society.</p><p>8. &#x0201c;Study population, sampling and sample size&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Study procedure&#x0201d; sections in the methods can be merged. The two sections include descriptions of how the researchers recruited participants.</p><p>9. Abstract, methods: The authors stated that they used &#x0201c;a semi-structured questionnaire&#x0201d;; however, it should be a structured questionnaire. A semi-structured questionnaire is usually used for qualitative interviews.</p><p>10. &#x0201c;Mental health&#x0201d; section in the discussion: The two sentences are conflicting as ADHD appears in both sentences. This should be corrected. &#x0201c;Depression, Anxiety, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder were the most prevalent co-morbidities. Schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and attention deficit hyperactivity</p><p>disorder (ADHD) were less common in this population.&#x0201d;</p><p>11. Overall, English writing and typos should be checked and corrected.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

I have a few minor comments.</p><p>1) The sample size seems to have been reduced from 499 to 354. However, there is no explanation for it. Why has it been reduced?</p><p>2) Abstract, Conclusion, and the Conclusion section in the manuscript: "Our study provides a comprehensive insight into..." I still think that the term "comprehensive" is a stretch. I suggest that the authors tone it down.</p><p>3) Introduction: "the rising burden of illicit drug use including injecting, continues to harm the economic, health, and social sectors." Again, I would argue that the current ways in which (illicit) drug use is regulated are causing the harm, not the (illicit) drug use per se. I defer to the Editor on this point.</p><p>4) Results, "HIV risk behavior" and "Drug use and sexual-related HIV risk factors" sections: These sections still contain some interpretation of the results. I defer to the Editor on this point.</p><p>5) Discussion, HIV prevalence: It is reported as 4.38%. However the results section reports it as 3.7%. The discrepancy needs to be resolved.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Thank you for this revised version. I would encourage you to reflect further on the comments and ensure that the abstract and paper - throughout - are coherent. As an example, you note in the limitations, there were some issues with gaining access to the population for this study, so it is not correct to claim this provides comprehensive insights.</p><p>I would encourage you to be very careful with the use of language - `HIV positives' is not acceptable since it defines a person by an infection. Please follow the People First Charter language. Likewise, the term `developing countries' was replaced many years ago by other terms.</p><p>Page 4 - rather than using the word `hotspots' describe the locations. What types of place did you meet people?</p><p>Page 5 and elsewhere - do you mean `flash blood syringes' or `flashblood'? And I suggest you explain what this is - some readers may not know.</p><p>Page 5 - was clearance gained from UNCST and CDC in addition to the Makerere REC?</p><p>Page 6 - Roman Catholic - consider use of capital letters for religious denominations/faiths since you have now used that for Anglican.</p><p>The paper requires very careful language editing. There are inconsistences - for example, data were/data was (use date were throughout). I suggest you employ an English language editor to help you.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
