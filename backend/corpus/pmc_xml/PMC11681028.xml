This study tests the hypothesis that calcium-chelating polycarboxylic acids can induce calcium dissolution without skin toxicity or irritancy. We compared citric acid (CA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to sodium thiosulfate (STS) for their ability to chelate calcium in vitro using a pharmaceutical dissolution model of calcinosis (hydroxyapatite (HAp) tablet), prior to evaluation of toxicity and irritancy in 2D in vitro skin models. Resultant data was used to predict therapeutic concentrations for application in a validated 3D skin irritation model (SkinEthic&#x02122;; EpiSkin SA) and to assay maximal percutaneous absorption. Dissolution performance was further assessed via ability to dissolve a calcified matrix laid down in vitro. Pharmacological dissolution studies identified that polycarboxylic acids were superior to STS in dissolving HAp tablets. In vitro, compounds had little effect on cell numbers at concentrations of &#x0003c;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;mM. When applied topically to 3D models as near-saturated solutions, chelators were not irritant nor did they impact model structure histologically. CA was the most efficient chelator of calcium salts. This study highlights polycarboxylic acids, particularly CA, as potential therapies to target calcinosis cutis: these should now be investigated in human studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Rheumatology</kwd><kwd>Chemistry</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012041</institution-id><institution>Versus Arthritis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21797</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burgess</surname><given-names>Kyle A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Calcinosis (sub-epidermal deposition of calcium salts; mainly hydroxyapatite, HAp)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> is a major clinical problem in patients with connective tissue disorders, in particular systemic sclerosis (SSc) where it affects ~&#x02009;20&#x02013;40% of patients. For these individuals, calcinosis represents an area of significant unmet clinical need<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Calcinosis typically affects the hands (~&#x02009;70% of cases), especially the fingers and thumbs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), but can develop at other upper and lower limb sites (especially over pressure points), and (less commonly) on the face, neck and trunk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Calcinosis is often painful, disabling, disfiguring, and at worse, life-threatening if it leads to systemic infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The pathogenesis of calcinosis, including SSc-related calcinosis, remains unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, thereby hindering any development of disease-modifying pharmacotherapy. As such, there is currently no effective treatment. Instead, disease management strategies comprise: (1) medical care, mainly prompt treatment of superadded infections and analgesia and; (2) surgical care (debridement or &#x02018;debulking&#x02019;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Images depicting examples of SSc-related calcinosis. <italic>Calcinosis cutis</italic> in the first and third digits of the hand (<bold>a</bold>,<bold>b</bold>), the calcinosis is well demonstrated on plain radiography (<bold>b</bold>), and the thumb (<bold>c</bold>,<bold>d</bold>).

In general, localised application of drug(s) to affected skin areas is less likely to cause systemic side effects than oral or intravenous delivery. In the case of SSc-related calcinosis, lesions are often ischaemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> which may further reduce the efficacy of systemically delivered treatments. Hence, topical application may support achieving higher concentration of the compound(s) at the site(s) of interest, so providing effective dissolution of calcinotic deposits.</p><p id="Par9">A small number of reports have claimed some clinical improvement following topical application of sodium thiosulfate (STS) when treating cases of refractory, non-healing calcinosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>; STS was tried topically based on its previous licenced use for calciphylaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Calcium displaces sodium in STS to form calcium thiosulfate, a much more soluble calcium salt. However, others argue STS inhibits vascular calcification independent of interactions with calcium or hydroxyapatite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. As of 2015, the potential use of STS as a topical therapy in ectopic calcification has led to filing of active patents in Europe, the USA and Japan (WO2013167741A1) and an observational study involving 120 patients (ClinicalTrials Identifier: NCT03979378). However, the efficacy of topical STS has been challenged in a recent retrospective study (2012&#x02013;2017) where only partial dissolution of ectopic calcification resulted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. A recent case study suggests the success of topical STS was found to be largely dependent on lesion size: complete resolution was achieved for all calcinotic lesions &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.2&#x000a0;cm in size, whereas the success rate dropped to 78% and 20% for larger lesions initially categorised as between 0.2 to 0.3 and 0.3 to 0.5 cm respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">In a bid to develop more effective topical therapies for calcinosis one strategy is to explore other calcium-chelating compounds for their relative effectiveness at dissolving subcutaneous calcification. Of particular interest are the polycarboxylic acids citric acid (CA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Both compounds are used at low concentrations in dermal preparations as pH adjusters and/or chelating agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. At much higher concentrations, these compounds are used routinely in dentistry to remove the smear layer during root canal surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Due to their calcium-chelating properties, both compounds have been recently implicated as potential therapeutic agents for calcinosis dissolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">This study provides the first in vitro comparison of different calcium chelators (STS, CA and EDTA) as topical agents aimed at managing calcinosis.

Histological examination also confirmed that chelators did not disrupt the integrity of the epidermal barrier over this time period. However, impact of topical application may only truly be assessed in vivo. This data was used to predict compound concentrations available to dissolve calcification. The dissolution performance of each chelator was then tested at these predicted dermal concentrations&#x02014;using two different in vitro models of calcinosis&#x02014;as a predictive measure of relative therapeutic efficacy. The first model compared dissolution of HAp over time at physiological conditions (37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), whereas the second model compared rate of dissolution with repeated application of chelator solutions using a calcified ECM. As calcinosis consists of both inorganic crystalline material (HAp) and organic material (approximately 50%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, these models provide a broad representation of physiological calcinosis. Importantly, both models highlighted CA as the most effective chelator, solubilising more HAp and removing more ECM calcification than either EDTA and STS at predicted dermal concentrations.

Overall, this study highlights the potential use of polycarboxylic acids&#x02014;particularly CA&#x02014;in topical therapies targeting subcutaneous calcification. Early phase clinical studies in healthy controls (to assess tolerance) and in patients with SSc-related calcinosis are now required, as a next step in identifying a safe and effective treatment for this painful and debilitating problem.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
