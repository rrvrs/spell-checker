This cross-sectional study aims to assess the prevalence and factors contributing to bullying in school-going children. The study seeks to give data for policymakers and parents, as it can inform initiatives aimed at improving the mental health of bullied children.&#x000a0;</p><p>Material and methods: This cross-sectional study comprised 1,000 students as study participants between the age group of 11 to 19 years. Both private and government schools were selected. Three different prevalidated questionnaires were utilised to gather data on the number of bullied students, their psychological health, and their social interactions. The data collected were quantitatively analysed to ascertain the number of students experiencing bullying and the psychiatric issues that may have arisen as a result.&#x000a0;</p><p>Results: The prevalence of bullied students was 399 out of 856 (46.73%), which was similar in government and private settings.&#x000a0;The proportion of bullied students reduced with higher age and grades. The mean age of bullied students was 14.27&#x000b1;1.68 years. The majority of students reported good self-esteem. However, about a quarter of the students reported clinically significant anxiety.&#x000a0;</p><p>Conclusion: The findings of this study clearly indicate that bullying is alarmingly prevalent among school-aged children. The data suggest a strong correlation between bullying involvement and behavioural problems among adolescents. This underscores the urgent need to investigate the causes of bullying further and to implement targeted interventions within schools to reduce its prevalence.&#x000a0;</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>abuse</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>bullying</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>government school</kwd><kwd>school bullying</kwd><kwd>victimization</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) published a global status report on school violence and bullying. This report highlighted the scope of bullying in school-going children and reported the prevalence of bullying ranging from 10% to 65% in different countries. It calls bullying a pattern and not just an incident that impacts the victim, bully, and other students physically, emotionally, and educationally [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>In India, the ramifications of bullying profoundly impact the physical and mental well-being of children, often with tragic outcomes. A concerning trend reveals that bullying predominantly affects children and adolescents from disadvantaged backgrounds, exacerbating their struggles as they navigate the school environment.&#x000a0;Statistics indicate that six out of 10 children and teenagers in India experience bullying, with a pronounced effect on those from poorer communities. For instance, Madhya Pradesh alone accounts for nearly 6% of bullying cases in the country [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Numerous studies have established a link between childhood or adolescent bullying and the subsequent development of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Victimisation has emerged as a critical factor undermining children's psychological health, frequently originating in the school setting but often going unrecognised [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Given that adolescents spend a considerable amount of time in school, research has increasingly focused on the educational context as a crucial environment for mental health outcomes [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>The consequences of bullying extend to various psychiatric disorders, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and suicidal behaviour [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While the negative health and psychosocial impacts of bullying are well-documented, research specifically addressing these issues in India remains limited [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To address this gap, the present study aims to&#x000a0;determine the prevalence of bullying, explore the dynamics of bullying in school-going children, and seek to understand the underlying factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study design and setting</p><p>A cross-sectional study was conducted to obtain data on bullying. The study was conducted in government and private schools across Bhopal after obtaining approval from the Institutional Human Ethical Committee of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, India, for the study (LOP no: AIIMS/BPL/IECSR/JAN/23/STS/07 dated 24 Aug 2023).</p><p>Study population</p><p>The cross-sectional study comprised students ages 11 to 19 who were enrolled in classes sixth through twelfth. Since adolescents deal with many issues throughout this stage of life, they are the study's target population.</p><p>Sample Size</p><p>A multiple-stage random sampling technique was used to select Bhopal's government and private schools. Originally, 1,000 students were registered to participate in this study; a sample size of 856 students was used, and 144 students were excluded from the study as they were not willing to participate.</p><p>Sampling technique</p><p>Both private and government schools were selected; each section comprised 40 students. Therefore, two sections per class in each school had to be chosen to reach the sample size. They were selected at random from school. In every government and private school that was selected, two sections of a single grade were chosen at random, ensuring that every class was represented in the sample. Every student's data from the chosen portions is included in the research.</p><p>Data collection methods and questionnaire</p><p>Data were collected anonymously through a physical questionnaire form filled out by them in their regular classes.</p><p>Consent Form</p><p>First, permission and consent were taken from students, and they were explained about the confidentiality of this research study.</p><p>Demographic Data</p><p>It included information about students, including their name, grade, gender, age, type of school, siblings, parents&#x02019; occupation, and education.</p><p>Peer Relations Questionnaire (PRQ)</p><p>It was used as a self-report measure for bullying. There were three subscales (victim, bully, and pro-social) and 12 items in total. A four-point Likert scale was used to rate the responses. The greater frequency of each behaviour tested was indicated by higher scores. A child was considered to be bullied if their victim scale score was more than 10 (Appendix A) [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSS)</p><p>This scale was used to assess self-esteem. Ten elements make up the scale: five are positive remarks, and five are negative statements. Typically, the RSS is graded using a Likert scale. Students have the option to select from four possible answers: strongly disagree, disagree, agree, and strongly agree. A minimum score of 10 and a maximum score of 40 were assigned to the RSS. In other instances, the range may vary from 0 to 30 based on the study and the way the response categories were added and classified. Students scoring more than 15 are classified as having strong self-esteem, while those scoring less than or equal to 15 are classified as having poor self-esteem (Appendix B) [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Disorders (SCARED) Scale</p><p>It was used for measuring anxiety in children.&#x000a0;It involved 41 items that assess a child&#x02019;s recent anxiety symptoms. Participants respond on a three-point Likert scale of 0 (not true or hardly ever true), one (somewhat or sometimes true), or two (very true or often true). A score of 25 and greater than 25 was suggested to be indicative of the&#x000a0;presence of clinically significant anxiety&#x000a0;(Appendix C) [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the descriptive statistics of the demographic details of the study population.&#x000a0;The participation of government schools was slightly higher than that of private schools.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Category-wise distribution of the demographic details of the study population</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Demographic details</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Frequency (percentage)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">Type of school</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Government</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">476 (55.60)</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Private</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">380 (44.40)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">Gender</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">477 (55.72)</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">379 (44.28)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean age of the students in years (Mean &#x000b1; Std.

The present study observed&#x000a0;that 399 (46.62%) out of 856&#x000a0;students had experienced bullying of any form. This was within the range of reports from other European nations (9% in Sweden to 54% in Lithuania) [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis of 80 international studies found that the mean prevalence rate of bullying participation was 35% [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Other high-income nations have also published prevalence rates (Australia: 18% for victims, 3% for bullies, and 5% for victims of bullying; USA: 8.4% for victims, 8.2% for bullies, and 3.7% for victims of bullying; and North America: 16.7% for victims, 15.1% for bullies, and 6.8% for victims of bullying) [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The present study showed a higher prevalence of bullying as compared to what has been reported in the literature. The prevalence in low- and middle-income countries was in a wider range, 8% in Tajikistan and 70% in Zambia [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, on the whole, the prevalence was higher in these settings as compared to the developed nations. The prevalence in India falls somewhere in between the two ends. This may be because of lower levels of education of the parents and the general atmosphere in schools where the traits of bullying go unchecked.</p><p>Consistent with past research, the results of this study demonstrate that bullying occurs in Indian schools, as neither instructors nor other adults in the school took any look at bullying that occurred at school [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Bullies are encouraged to victimise other students at schools with a positive bullying culture, and victims are likewise discouraged from reporting bullying to officials in the school.</p><p>The bullying trait is reduced with an increase in age and grades. This showed that students of lower grades were more prone to being bullied. Efforts should be made to address this problem, and specific provisions should be in place so that&#x000a0;the psychological impact of this can be reduced for the affected students.</p><p>The students generally scored well on the Rosenmuller scale, indicating that the students had good self-esteem despite the prevalent bullying culture. Similarly, most of the students fared well on the SCARED scale, which indicates the&#x000a0;presence of significant anxiety. However, the number of students who showed the presence of clinically significant anxiety was about a quarter of all study participants.</p><p>In the present study, the authors found that private and government schools had almost equal exposure to bullying. This was different from the recent study done in Brazil (2015), which reported that bullying victimisation was more likely to be reported in private schools than in government schools (odds ratio (OR) =1.17; 95% CI: 1.04-1.31) [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The insights from this study can be instrumental for school governing bodies, policymakers, and mental health professionals, providing a clearer understanding of the challenges faced by school-aged children. Addressing issues related to bullying and its psychosocial impacts is crucial for promoting better mental health outcomes.</p><p>It is imperative to raise awareness about bullying within society, encouraging children to share their experiences and seek support rather than suffer in silence. By fostering inclusive environments and positive social dynamics, we can help build a healthier future for the next generation.</p><p>Because the study is cross-sectional in nature, it has limitations when it comes to drawing conclusions about causality. All of the study's data were gathered via self-administered questionnaires. One drawback of utilising self-administered questionnaires is that some of the questions may be hard for students to grasp. In order to address this shortcoming, the authors individually went over each question with the participants before&#x000a0;distributing the questionnaire so that students don&#x02019;t find it hard to understand the questions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this study clearly indicate that bullying is alarmingly prevalent among school-aged children in Indian settings, and almost every second child reports having been bullied at some point in time. The students in middle schools in their mid-teens are more prone to getting bullied. About a quarter of students showed indications of clinically significant levels of anxiety as a result of bullying.
