However, at present, its precise mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the specific role of AURKC in renal clear cell carcinoma and its mechanism was investigated. The protein expression levels of AURKC were evaluated in clear cell carcinoma and adjacent normal tissues, followed by prognostic analysis. Subsequently, cell models with knocked-down and overexpressed AURKC were constructed for <italic>in vitro</italic> cell experiments, and tumor-bearing mouse models were constructed to confirm the specific role of AURKC <italic>in vivo</italic>. AURKC was found to be highly expressed in ccRCC, which was associated with poor prognosis. In the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, the expression levels of CyclinD1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) proteins were downregulated after AURKC knockdown, and the cell proliferation ability was found to decrease significantly. After AURKC overexpression, the levels of ERp57 protein expression increased significantly, also significantly enhancing the cell proliferation ability. In addition, AURKC was found to interact with ERp57 and exhibited a colocalization relationship. In the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, AURKC downregulation significantly inhibited the expression of ERp57 protein and blocked the growth of tumor tissue in tumor-bearing mice. These results suggest that the abnormal expression of AURKC in ccRCC enhances the expression of ERp57 protein, thereby promoting the proliferation of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Thus, AURKC shows potential as a target for the treatment of ccRCC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aurora kinase C</kwd><kwd>clear cell renal cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>ERp57</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="Section1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Renal cell carcinoma is the second most common malignancy in the urinary system, accounting for approximately 2-3% of adult tumors<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. According to the data, over 350,000 new cases of RCC are diagnosed worldwide each year, with more than 150,000 deaths and the prevalence and detection rate of RCC increasing year by year<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. ccRCC is the most common subtype of RCC, accounting for approximately 80-90% of RCC cases. Compared with other subtypes, such as chromophobe cell carcinoma and papillary cell carcinoma, ccRCC progresses faster and has a worse prognosis<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. For early ccRCC, partial nephrectomy is the most important treatment method, and the prognosis is good. However, as many as 20-30% of patients have metastatic lesions at the time of initial diagnosis, whose 5-year survival rate is often less than 10%<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. At present, there is a lack of effective methods for the treatment of metastatic lesions or postoperative tumor recurrence. Existing methods, including conventional chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, are associated with a range of problems, from a low response rate and significant side effects to a heavy economic burden<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Therefore, better understanding the occurrence and development mechanism of ccRCC and exploring new and effective therapeutic targets is urgently needed in the field of RCC research.</p><p>AURKC belongs to the serine/threonine protein kinase member of the Aurora family and is a key regulatory factor of the chromosomal passenger complex protein kinase during cell mitosis<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. According to the literature, AURKC is a candidate biomarker for multiple cancers<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. The aberrant expression of AURKC can induce the transformation and oncogenicity of epithelial cells and the growth of ovarian cancer cells<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. In addition, the targeted inhibition of AURKC has been shown to reduce the metastasis of cancer cells<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Although studies have previously highlighted the potential therapeutic potential of AURKC, the mechanism by which AURKC promotes cancer remains unclear.</p><p>Endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 57(ERp57), Identified as protein disulfide isomerase family A, member 3 (abbreviated as PDIA3), it belongs to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) gene lineage. It was named after the fact that it was first reported to promote the folding of glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. However, the function of ERp57 goes far beyond that in the ER<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Research findings have indicated that the expression of ERp57 is frequently disrupted across various forms of malignancies, with either increased or decreased levels of ERp57 linked to unfavorable outcomes in neoplasms<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Notably, ERp57 expression is diminished in the initial stages of cervical cancer, whereas it is elevated in the advanced, invasive stages, suggesting the intricate nature of its function in carcinogenesis and its intimate connection with molecular chaperones<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. In previous studies, we found that ERp57 is upregulated in ccRCC, promoting the transcription of interleukin enhancer binding factor 3 (ILF3) after binding to signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthemore, ILF3 can bind and stabilize the mRNA of ERp57, thereby promoting the expression of ERp57. The feedback loop formed by ERp57/STAT3/ILF3 plays a key role in the proliferation mechanism of ccRCC<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. However, a correlation between ERp57 and AURKC has yet to be reported. In this study, the interaction between ERp57 and AURKC is described, providing potentially useful insights for use in the treatment of ccRCC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="Section2"><title>2.

These animals were nurtured within the confines of the Animal Research Facility at Hebei Medical University's Fourth Hospital (SYXK2022-011), and were adaptively fed for one week after purchase before starting the relevant experiments. Exponentially growing SW839 cells were subcutaneously injected into the backs of the mice at a dose of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> per mouse. On the third day after injection, the mice were randomly divided into a control group and a treatment group, with three mice in each group. The experimental cohort received Danusertib via intraperitoneal administration at a dosage of 15 milligrams per kilogram per day, on an alternating three-day schedule, whereas the comparator cohort was administered an equivalent amount of physiological saline solution containing hydrochloric acid<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.

Post this, the tissue sections underwent a triple rinse with PBS before being exposed to the relevant secondary antibody (identified by the code S0001, diluted at a ratio of 1:100; provided by Affinity Biosciences, headquartered in China) for a period of 30 min. DAB solution (P0202; Beyotime, China) was then added and incubated for 3 min, followed by the addition of hematoxylin (C0107; Beyotime, China) and incubation for 2 min.

The initial antibody (catalog number 38-9400, diluted 1:100; supplied by Thermo Fisher Scientific, based in China) was subsequently applied and subjected to an overnight incubation period. Following this, the conjugate antibody (identified as A-11037, diluted 1:100; also from Thermo Fisher Scientific, China) was introduced and kept at room temperature for a period of 60 min.

Subsequent to quantifying the RNA, the SuperScript&#x02122; IV First Strand Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog number 18091050, China) was employed as directed. The synthesis reaction was conducted at a temperature of 50&#x000b0;C for a duration of 10 min to generate cDNA. The FastKing One-Step RT-PCR Kit (code KR123; Tiangen Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., China) was then utilized, incorporating specific primers into the cDNA template.

The protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein quantification kit (P0009; Beyotime, China), and the lysis buffer and loading buffer (P00015L; Beyotime, China) were supplemented according to the protein concentration. Gel electrophoresis was performed, and an equal amount of protein solution was added to the loading well. The electrical potential was adjusted to 80 volts for a duration of half an hour, followed by an increase to 120 volts for one hour. Post-electrophoretic procedures involved a transfer process, during which the electrical current was maintained at 260 milliamps for a period of 90 min. Subsequently, the PVDF membrane was submerged in a 5% solution of non-fat milk powder (catalog number P0216; supplied by Beyotime, a company based in China) and subjected to incubation for two hours. Next, primary antibody was added and the membrane was incubated at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. Then, the secondary antibody was added, followed by incubation for 2 h. Finally, the membrane was washed in Tris Buffered Saline with Tween-20 three times. Next, chemiluminescent fluid was dropped and placed in a gel imager for photography, and the photos were saved for Image J 1.52a statistical analysis. The following antibodies were used: AURKC (38-9400, 1:1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, China), CyclinD1 (ab134175, 1:1000; Abcam, China), PCNA (ab29, 1:1000; Abcam, China), ERp57 (ab13506, 1:1000; Abcam, China), &#x003b2;-actin (ab8226, 1:2000; Abcam, China), GADPH (ab8245, 1:2000; Abcam, China), goat anti-rabbit (A0277, 1:5000; Beyotime, China), goat anti-mouse (A0286, 1:5000; Beyotime, China).</p></sec><sec id="Section2.11"><title>2.11 Co-immunoprecipitation (COIP)</title><p>Cell lysis was performed as previously described.

Results</title><sec id="Section3.1"><title>3.1 AURKC is upregulated in ccRCC tissues and correlates with poor prognosis</title><p>To evaluate the role of AURKC in ccRCC, we first detected the expression of AURKC in ccRCC (n=40) and adjacent tissues (n=40) using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. As shown in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A, compared with the adjacent tissues, the protein level of AURKC was significantly increased in ccRCC tissues. Immunofluorescence staining also confirmed that the expression of AURKC was significantly increased in ccRCC tissues (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). In addition, the western blotting results also showed that the protein expression of AURKC in ccRCC tissues was significantly higher than that in adjacent tissues (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). The RT-qPCR results showed that the mRNA levels of AURKC in ccRCC tissues was significantly higher (approximately 3 times) than that in the adjacent tissues (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). These results indicate that AURKC is upregulated in ccRCC tissues. Further, according to the expression levels of AURKC mRNA, 40 patients with ccRCC were divided into two groups (a high-expression group and a low-expression group). Then, survival analysis was performed on the two groups. The results shown in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E indicate that patients with high AURKC expression had a significantly worse prognosis than those with low levels of expression. These findings confirm that the expression of AURKC was increased in patients with ccRCC, suggesting that high levels of AURKC expression are closely related to poor prognosis.</p></sec><sec id="Section3.2"><title>3.2 AURKC is involved in ccRCC cell proliferation</title><p>To further investigate the role of AURKC in the proliferation of ccRCC cells, we conducted relevant biological function experiments. To this end, RT-qPCR was used to detect the AURKC mRNA expression levels in five different ccRCC cell lines. As shown in Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, the results demonstrated that among the five ccRCC cell lines, the AURKC mRNA expression level was the lowest in the SKRC-39 cell line, while the ERp57 mRNA expression level in the SW839 cell line was significantly higher than that in the other cells. Consequently, in the subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> cell function experiments, the SKRC-39 cell line was selected for AURKC overexpression, while the SW839 cell line was selected for AURKC knockdown. Western blot analysis revealed that compared with the control group, the transfection of si-AURKC in SW839 cells significantly downregulated the protein and mRNA expression levels of AURKC in the cells (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). In contrast, we synthesized the AURKC overexpression plasmid pWPI-AURKC and transfected it into the SKRC-39 cells. As shown in Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, after the transfection of pWPI-AURKC in SKRC-39 cells, the expression levels of AURKC protein and mRNA in the cells were significantly increased with statistically significant results. Furthermore, we employed the CCK-8 assay to evaluate the role of AURKC in cell proliferation. As shown in Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D, compared with the control group, the knockdown of AURKC expression in the SW839 cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation, while the overexpression of AURKC in the SKRC-39 cells promoted cell proliferation with statistically significant results. Additionally, the results of western blotting analysis demonstrated that compared with the control group, the knockdown of AURKC in the SW839 cells significantly downregulated the levels of the signature proteins of cell proliferation, namely Cyclin D1 and PCNA. By contrast, the overexpression of AURKC in the SKRC-39 cells promoted cell proliferation. These findings suggest that AURKC functions as an oncogene and is involved in the proliferation of ccRCC (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E).</p></sec><sec id="Section3.3"><title>3.3 AURKC interacts with ERp57 in ccRCC cells</title><p>To clarify the interaction between AURKC and ERp57 in ccRCC cells and confirm their relationship, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation (COIP) experiment. As shown in Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A and B, in SW839 and SKRC-39 cells, co-precipitation was performed using an AURKC antibody. ERp57 protein was detected in the resulting precipitate, indicating that ERp57 directly binds to AURKC to form a complex. Then, immunofluorescence double staining was used to confirm the interaction between the two. As shown in Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C and D, the co-localization of AURKC and ERp57 was observed in the cytoplasm of ccRCC cells and tissues. These results indicate that in ccRCC cells, AURKC and ERp57 interact to form a complex.</p></sec><sec id="Section3.4"><title>3.4 AURKC enhances the expression level of ERp57 protein</title><p>To further confirm the regulatory effect of AURKC on ERp57, the RT-qPCR results indicated that AURKC knockdown significantly reduced the expression levels of ERp57 mRNA, while AURKC overexpression upregulated the ERp57 mRNA expression levels (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Subsequently, we knocked down the expression of AURKC in SW839 cells and detected the protein expression level of ERp57 using western blotting. The results showed that knocking down AURKC in SW839 cells significantly downregulated the expression levels of ERp57 protein; conversely, overexpressing AURKC in SKRC-39 cells significantly upregulated the ERp57 protein expression levels (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B and C). We also found that the protein expression level of ERp57 in the nucleus and cytoplasm was significantly reduced (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D).

In the present study, we sought to confirm whether the small molecule inhibitor of AURKC can exert anti-tumor effects by inhibiting the AURKC/ERp57 pathway. Danusertib, an aurora kinase inhibitor, has been shown to exert anti-tumor effects in several types of tumor cells<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. To evaluate this, we added different concentrations of Danusertib (0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.25, 1.25, and 6.25 &#x003bc;mol/L) to SW398 cells and stimulated them for 24 h before detecting cell proliferation using CCK8 assays. The results showed that Danusertib significantly inhibited the proliferation of ccRCC cells compared with the negative control group, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.99&#x000b1;0.4818 &#x003bc;mol/L (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Furthermore, to evaluate cell proliferation at different time points using CCK-8, 2.99 &#x003bc;mol/L of Danusertib was added to SW398 cells. The results showed that Danusertib significantly inhibited the proliferation of ccRCC cells in a time-dependent manner (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). In addition, after adding Danusertib to SW839 cells for 48 h, the results of western blotting analysis showed that Danusertib significantly downregulated the protein expression levels of cell proliferation-related proteins PCNA and Cyclin D1 compared with the control group. These results indicate that Danusertib is capable of inhibiting the proliferation of ccRCC cells (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). To further verify that Danusertib exerts anti-tumor effects by inhibiting the AURKC/ERp57 pathway, we added Danusertib to SW839 cells and detected the expression of ERp57 by western blotting. As shown in Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C, the addition of Danusertib significantly downregulated the expression of ERp57 in cells; in addition, the remedial experiment also confirmed that the addition of Danusertib significantly inhibited the expression of ERp57. However, when the cells were overexpressed with AURKC, this inhibitory effect was weakened. These results suggest that Danusertib inhibits the proliferation of ccRCC cells by suppressing the expression levels of AURKC and ERp57 proteins (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D).</p></sec><sec id="Section3.6"><title>3.6 Inhibition of ccRCC tumor growth by Danusertib in <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments</title><p>Although the results indicated that Danusertib acts as an AURKC inhibitor, to further confirm the role of Danusertib in ccRCC, we conducted an <italic>in vivo</italic> tumorigenicity experiment in nude mice. After the tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed, a top-down photograph was taken (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A) showing the subcutaneous tumor tissue (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). After injecting the nude mice with SW893 cells, the tumor volume and weight were found to be significantly reduced after the administration of Danusertib compared with the normal saline control group (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C and D). Next, the levels of AURKC and ERp57 protein expression were detected by western blotting (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E) and immunohistochemistry (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F), the results of which indicate that the expression of AURKC and ERp57 in the Danusertib group was significantly decreased.

Discussion</title><p>The identification of cancer prognostic factors is a key approach in the development of highly efficient targeted drugs<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. In the present study, high levels of AURKC expression were found to be associated with poor prognosis in ccRCC. AURKC was found to be abnormally expressed in both ccRCC tissues and cells, which is consistent with the results of previous studies on AURKC. Herein, we successfully demonstrated that downregulating AURKC can inhibit the proliferation of ccRCC cells and tissues using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. CyclinD1 is known to be a key regulator of the progression of the G1 phase of the cell cycle, binding to CDK4 or CDK6 to form a complex that activates the cell cycle<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. PCNA is widely expressed in the S phase and binds to DNA polymerase to participate in DNA replication<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Abnormally expressed CyclinD1 is known to be closely related to the occurrence and development of various cancers<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. In fact, CyclinD1 overexpression may lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation, thereby promoting the formation of cancer<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. The expression levels of PCNA are also often used as an indicator of cell proliferation activity, and plays a significant role in cancer diagnosis and prognosis<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. Our findings indicate that the downregulation of AURKC can significantly inhibit the protein expression levels of CyclinD1 and PCNA, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of ccRCC cells.</p><p>To further elucidate the regulatory mechanism of AURKC, we turned our attention to ERp57. Numerous studies have indicated that ERp57 is mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, with a small amount entering the nucleus<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. However, in the presents study, an increase in the nuclear distribution of ERp57 was observed in tumor cells. Based on this finding, we investigated the mechanism underpinning the regulation of the nuclear entry of ERp57. Changes in the intracellular distribution of proteins are often due to modifications, such as phosphorylation, alterations in their sequences, or interactions with other molecules<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. Hence, we wondered whether ERp57 may be driven into the nucleus by interactions with other protein molecules. Previously, some studies have found that ERp57 can interact with multiple protein molecules; among these, one specific protein, aurora kinase C (AURKC), caught our attention<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. In subsequent immunoprecipitation experiments, we confirmed that AURKC interacts with ERp57 (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A and B). In fact, we found that after knocking down AURKC in ccRCC or following treatment with a phosphokinase inhibitor, the expression level of ERp57 was significantly downregulated, and the distribution of ERp57 in the nucleus also decreased, providing evidence in support of our hypothesis.</p><p>The main result of this study is the discovery that AURKC interacts with ERp57, with the overexpression of AURKC enhancing the levels of ERp57 protein expression to induce the abnormal proliferation of ccRCC. Although these results are exciting, it is worth highlighting the potential limitations of this study. Whether AURKC, as a serine/threonine protein kinase, promotes the entry of ERp57 into the nucleus by phosphorylating and modifying it after interacting with it, the mechanism underlying this process remains unclear and requires further experimental verification. Furthemore, whether inhibiting AURKC to induce ERp57 can inhibit the invasion and metastasis of ccRCC cells is also unclear, and additional experiments, such as invasion and metastasis assays, will be needed to clarify this. In our previous study, we found that ERp57 was upregulated in ccRCC and promoted the transcription of ILF3 after binding to STAT3. At present, whether AURKC is involved in this mechanism is not clear; however, we plan to make this the focus of future research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, the existence of a correlation between AURKC and ERp57, as well as their ability to promote the progression of ccRCC, was demonstrated. Taken together, these results indicate that AURKC may serve as a prognostic biomarker for ccRCC, providing a theoretical basis for the development of new anti-cancer targeted drugs.</p></sec><sec id="SM0" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supplementary table.</p></caption><media xlink:href="jcav16p1215s1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The research presented here was financially backed by the Hebei Provincial Natural Science Foundation under grant number H2020206397.</p></sec><sec><title>Access to data and resources</title><p>The dataset associated with this study can be obtained from the lead researcher if a justified request is made.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>All procedures involving animals were carried out in compliance with the project permit number (SYXK2022-011), which was granted by the Ethics Board of the Animal Research Facility at Hebei Medical University's Fourth Hospital, adhering to the established protocols for Institutional Animal Welfare and Utilization.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient consent for publication</title><p>Every protocol involving human subjects was meticulously adhered to, aligning with the ethical guidelines set forth by the institutional and/or research ethics board, as well as abiding by the revised principles of the Declaration of Helsinki from 2013.
