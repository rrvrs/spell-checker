The World Health Organization estimates that 50&#x000a0;million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy and that 70% of those individuals might be seizure free with the right diagnosis and care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Seizures fall into two main categories: generalized seizures and partial (focal) seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. One of the causes of epilepsy is excessive and aberrant neuronal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which is caused by either acquired or hereditary factors, including birth abnormalities, brain infections, brain tumors, and injuries to the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The major objectives of treating epilepsy are to prevent seizures, minimize or avoid the negative effects of drugs, and avoid drug interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The treatment of epilepsy includes medications known as antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as levetiracetam, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate. It may also involve surgical procedures and non pharmacological approaches, such as vagus nerve stimulation, behavioral-modification therapies, diet, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. First-line agents for status epilepticus include benzodiazepines such as midazolam, diazepam, and lorazepam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Studies have shown that pharmacists are critical resources for patients with epilepsy seeking information about their condition and prescription drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Enhancing patients&#x02019; knowledge and awareness may increase adherence and reduce drug interactions, which could improve clinical outcomes and enhance patients&#x02019; quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Community and hospital pharmacists evaluate the need for AEDs, prevent errors, and guide patients or their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Medication management is the most often reported service provided by pharmacists to people with epilepsy, followed by education and counseling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Few papers have focused on the use of care coordination documentation tools by doctors or pharmacists in the treatment of patients with epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A study conducted in the United Arab Emirates reported that in addition to dispensing prescription drugs, community pharmacies frequently play a more active role in supporting individuals with epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. One of the main obstacles preventing pharmacists from giving patients the best care possible is a lack of knowledge and experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Inadequate knowledge among community pharmacists regarding AEDs poses a significant challenge in ensuring optimal medication management and patient care. A limited understanding of AEDs, including their mechanisms of action, side effects, drug interactions, and dosing regimens, may result in suboptimal therapy outcomes, medication errors, and compromised patient safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. AEDs impact patients&#x02019; health since they frequently cause hepatotoxicity, renal stones, polycystic ovarian syndrome, aplastic anemia, rash, and a decrease in vital signs such as vitamins D and B12. However, 20&#x02013;30% of patients treated with AEDs develop drug resistance, and up to half of patients experience side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This underscores the essential role of pharmacists in providing medication management and regular monitoring to minimize adverse effects and improve treatment outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need to evaluate pharmacist knowledge of AEDs to increase the knowledge and awareness of community pharmacists regarding AEDs, thereby improving the quality of pharmaceutical care provided to patients with epilepsy and ultimately optimizing treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In Sudan, no research has been carried out to include Sudanese pharmacists from various states. Therefore, this study is the first of its type aimed to evaluate the knowledge of Sudanese pharmacists about AEDs and the factors that affect their knowledge in Port Sudan, Atbara, Gedaref, and Kassala, Sudan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par10">A cross-sectional analytical study design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par11">The study was conducted in the cities of Atbara, Gedaref, Kassala, and Port Sudan, Sudan, from October 1 to 30, 2024.

The sampling procedure was conducted in two steps. Initially, the study area was divided into four strata (Atbara, Gedaref, Kassala, and Port Sudan), i.e., probability stratified sampling. Second, 96 samples were collected from each stratum (non proportion) at several pharmacies and hospitals, i.e., nonprobability convenience sampling. The difficulty in formulating a sampling frame for all the pharmacists within each city made the probability sampling technique too difficult and the convenience sampling technique more appropriate in this study. The most significant issue with convenience sampling is that it may not represent the overall population. Therefore, we used multiple locations for sample collection. We visited different pharmacies and hospitals, met all the pharmacists presented at the time of the visit and invited them to answer the questionnaires at their workplace. After receiving their approval to participate in the study, we filled out the questionnaire. Depending on their availability, the questionnaire was completed at the time of the visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par19">A modified and validated English questionnaire with two sections was used. With a focus on demographic/practice information and theoretical scenarios in epilepsy pharmacotherapy. Pharmacists chose responses to theoretical cases and provided the correct answer within 15&#x000a0;min without the use of an external source. Section one concerns demographic and practice information (nine questions), such as gender, age, degree and place from which the basic pharmacy degree was obtained, years of experience as community pharmacists/hospital pharmacists, specific training on AEDs during the pharmacy degree program and practice setting, and the number of people with epilepsy seen monthly. Section two includes 10 items (drawing a circle around the correct answer) related to the theoretical situation in the pharmacotherapy of epilepsy, including emergency situations in the pharmacotherapy of epilepsy, drug&#x02013;drug interactions, the initial dose of lamotrigine, and the interpretation of the blood concentration of valproic acid. Pharmacists had to respond to each theoretical case by selecting one of the following multiple choices: (a) dispense; (b) dispense and recommend consulting a doctor upon the next appointment; (c) dispense after calling the doctor regarding drug&#x02013;drug interaction (DDI); (d) do not dispense, call the doctor and refer the patient back to change the prescription; (e) do not dispense, call the doctor and urgently refer the patient to an emergency room; or (f) do not know [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">We modified the questionnaire to better align with the actual situation of pharmacies and drugs in Sudan that are frequently used without change in the question objective.

A normal distribution was determined via the Kolmogorov&#x02012;Smirnov test. Data that were normally distributed are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation, and not normally distributed are expressed as medians with interquartile ranges. The interquartile range (IQR) was calculated by subtracting Q1 from Q3 (Q3&#x02013;Q1). After the applicability conditions were checked, the Pearson chi-square test and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test were used to compare categorical data. Qualitative data are presented as frequencies (percentages).

All variables associated with pharmacist knowledge at a p value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.200 in the univariable model were included in the multivariable model via the enter method after being checked for multicollinearity and interaction. The results are displayed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and a statistically significant difference was considered at a p value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05. The knowledge levels were analyzed by assigning 1 point to each correct answer and zero points for the answer &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t know&#x0201d; or if the respondent did not answer the question. The pharmacist was informed in advance: to penalize guessing, 0.5 points well be deducted for each wrong answer to encourage the use &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t know&#x0201d; as a response to prevent point deductions, which effectively limits the potential for negative scoring and false positive results to reflect the actual knowledge level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The total participant score is then divided by 10 and multiplied by 100 to obtain final scores as percentages {if participant achieved 5 out of 10 points = (5/10) x100&#x02009;=&#x02009;50%}, with a score of 50% or more taken as an indicator of good knowledge and a score of less than 50 as an indicator of poor knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par34">This was a cross-sectional analytical study design aimed at assessing the knowledge of community and hospital pharmacists about AEDs in Atbara city, Gedaref city, Kassala city and Port Sudan city in Sudan, revealing significant insights into their understanding and potential implications for patient care. The majority of the pharmacists who participated in our study reported poor knowledge about AEDs; the responses to the clinical scenarios indicated a concerning level of uncertainty and inconsistency in practice. A limited understanding of AEDs, including their mechanisms of action, side effects, drug interactions, and dosing regimens, may result in suboptimal therapy outcomes, medication errors, and compromised patient safety.</p><p id="Par35">In this study, the median score of knowledge percentage was 10, with an IQR of 30. This score is lower than that reported in another cross-sectional observational study conducted among community and hospitals pharmacists in Palestinian which reported a median score of 33.4, with an IQR of 33.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and lower than the median score reported in a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among community pharmacists in Khartoum State, Sudan 36.68, with an IQR of 21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, this finding was lower than that reported in a cross-sectional study conducted among community and hospital pharmacists in Israel, in which the authors calculated the mean, which was 48 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This variation might be linked to the differences in study participants and study designs. This result highlights the urgent need to implement mandatory programs or training to increase pharmacists&#x02019; knowledge about AED.</p><p id="Par36">In our study, only 6.5% of the respondents had good knowledge. Similar results were reported in a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among community pharmacists in Khartoum State, Sudan, in which 14.7% of the participants had good knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Given these similarities, it is possible that the problem of poor knowledge is not unique to our sample but rather represents more general patterns in comparable groups or geographical areas. The result of this study was less than the observational cross-sectional study carried out among medical students, Sudan reported that 63% of students have a high level of knowledge, which can be explained by the fact that the academic environment may actively encourage students to update their knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additionally, the findings of this study were less than those of most published studies, such as a cross-sectional study carried out among community pharmacists in the city of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso, in which 48.21% of the respondents had good knowledge of epilepsy; a cross-sectional study conducted among community pharmacists in Libya reported that 60.0% had good knowledge about epilepsy and its treatment with AEDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; and a cross-sectional observational study conducted among pharmacists with different backgrounds in Canada reported that 42.2% of the participants reported good knowledge of epilepsy management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This clear variation between studies may be linked to the fact that the availability and quality of educational resources about epilepsy can vary widely across regions. Areas with better access to healthcare education and training programs may have higher levels of knowledge among the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our analysis highlights a significant knowledge gap that necessitates further investigation into the reasons behind this ignorance and the integration of the results of previous research to create focused educational initiatives.</p><p id="Par37">In this study, a notable result showed that no respondent&#x02019;s pharmacist residing in Port Sudan achieved a score of 50% or higher, which is markedly different from other cities. This result suggests that there might be an underlying issue affecting the pharmacists in Port Sudan. Factors such as differences in the working environment, including workload might impact pharmacists&#x02019; ability to maintain or enhance their knowledge. Given that Port Sudan City now serves as the temporary administrative capital of Sudan due to the military conflict in the official capital, Khartoum. Additionally, economic conditions, specific health challenges and needs, and lack of access to continuing education, resources, or professional development opportunities could contribute to this low performance. Therefore, a more extensive assessment is needed to identify specific barriers faced by pharmacists in Port Sudan.</p><p id="Par38">In our study, only 48.4% of the pharmacists recognized suicidal thoughts associated with levetiracetam. This is less than a cross-sectional study conducted among community and hospital pharmacists in Israel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], in which 70% of the respondents recognized severe suicidal thoughts related to levetiracetam, and less than that documented in a descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among community pharmacists in Khartoum State, Sudan, in which 68% of the respondents answered the question well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Additionally, the findings of this study were less than those reported in a cross-sectional observational study was conducted among community and hospitals pharmacists in Palestine, where 79% of the pharmacists correctly answered the question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Regional variations in pharmacy education and curricula may affect how well-versed pharmacists are in identifying and treating side effects, especially those that are as serious as suicidal thoughts. Pharmacists in countries with more comprehensive training on psychiatric medications may be more aware of potential side effects, including suicidal thoughts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In many situations, recognizing suicidal thoughts linked to levetiracetam could save lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The relatively low identification rate of suicidal thoughts linked to levetiracetam among the pharmacists in this study highlights the importance of strengthening pharmaceutical education initiatives to guarantee that pharmacists are prepared to identify and handle medication-related mental health concerns.</p><p id="Par39">In this study, 63.5% of the pharmacists knew that rash was a serious side effect of lamotrigine, which was in line with the findings reported in a descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among community pharmacists in Khartoum State, Sudan (63.9%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and in a cross-sectional observational study was conducted among community and hospitals pharmacists in Palestine 67% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The finding of this study was higher than reported by a cross-sectional observational study conducted among pharmacists with different backgrounds in Canada, in which 20% of the participants were aware of the urgency of a lamotrigine rash and acknowledged the importance of seeking medical advice when dealing with rashes caused by lamotrigine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and a cross-sectional study conducted among community and hospital pharmacists in Israel reported that 20% of the pharmacists were aware of the urgency of a lamotrigine rash [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This difference in awareness raises issues regarding patient safety. If pharmacists lack awareness of the seriousness of lamotrigine rashes, it could affect their ability to provide effective patient counseling or identify possible drug-related concerns, which might result in delayed treatment or improper symptom management.</p><p id="Par40">Approximately 42% of the participants could take the right action of dealing with DDI when carbamazepine was prescribed with artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem<sup>R</sup>). Carbamazepine induces hepatic enzymes, which can lead to decreased levels of artemether/lumefantrine in the body and potentially reduce the effectiveness of Coartem<sup>R</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Owing to the prevalence of malaria in Sudan and the fact that artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem<sup>R</sup>) is the first line of malaria treatment, we need to be more aware that Coartem<sup>R</sup> should not be prescribed with carbamazepine. Therefore, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before dispensing these medications to ensure safe and effective drug use. Additionally, regarding the DDI of carbamazepine, only 19.5% of our pharmacists understood the interaction between carbamazepine and oral contraceptives. Carbamazepine induces liver enzymes, which are responsible for the metabolism of hormonal contraceptives and result in decreased serum levels of contraceptive hormones and an increased risk of contraceptive failure, leading to unintended pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">With respect to valproic acid DDI, 52.3% of our pharmacists took the right action when valproic acid was prescribed with the meropenum. A retrospective study of patients treated with valproate medications revealed that the analysis of the drug interaction between valproic acid and meropenem indicated an average decrease in valproic acid levels of 77% (range, 34 to 99%) and aggravated epileptic seizures in 48% of the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These results emphasize the importance of pharmacist involvement in handling DDIs and the wide consequences for patient safety and the effectiveness of therapy. Continuous training for pharmacists about DDIs and their possible effects is crucial for enhancing care for patients taking various medications. On the other hand, a cross-sectional study conducted in Khartoum state, Sudan, to evaluate valproic acid drug interactions revealed that 43.8% of respondents selected the correct action regarding the interaction of valproic acid with lamotrigine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. One of the main areas where a skilled pharmacist could be helpful is in screening for and warning about DDIs. The percentage of DDIs may increase as a result of pharmacists&#x02019; inadequate understanding of drug interactions related to epilepsy. Therefore, pharmacists need to easily access the most recent clinical guidelines, drug interaction databases, or pertinent literature that can assist them in screening DDIs.</p><p id="Par42">In terms of AED safety, in this study, only 18.5% of the participants knew that valproic acid taken during pregnancy is associated with a greater risk of birth defects, which is less than that reported in a descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among community pharmacists in Khartoum State, Sudan, which revealed that 42.4% of participants do not dispense, call the doctor and refer the patient back to change the prescription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and a cross-sectional observational study was conducted among community and hospitals pharmacists in Palestine revealed that 56.6% of pharmacists do not dispense, call the doctor and refer the patient back to change the prescription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The small proportions of pharmacists who send patients back to doctors or who refrain from dispensing the medication raise concerns about patient safety. This emphasizes the importance of improved communication among patients, pharmacists, and doctors who prescribe medication. Pharmacists are essential in managing medications and should be promoted to serve as advocates for patient safety.</p><p id="Par43">With respect to factors associated with the knowledge of pharmacists, multivariable logistic regression revealed that there was a statistical significant correlation between community or hospital pharmacist and scoring&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50%, with (76%) of those scoring&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50 attributed to community pharmacists. Although the hospital pharmacists generally are more likely to have good knowledge than the community pharmacists, this difference can be attributed to the reality that AEDs in Sudan are dispensed primarily in community pharmacies, leading to greater exposure for community pharmacists to these medications in comparison to hospital pharmacists. In addition, a statistically significant correlation was found between years of experience and scoring&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50%, with the highest percentage of (56%) noted for those with 1&#x02013;5 years of experiences and the lowest (4%) for those with more than 10 years of experience. This finding might appear illogical, but it might indicate newer education, updated curricula, or a reduced dependence on routine practice without ongoing education, in addition to that younger pharmacists are increasingly utilizing modern digital tools and platforms, including mobile drug reference applications (e.g., Up-to-date, Medscape), artificial inelegance-driven clinical decision support systems, and online continuing education courses to broaden their knowledge. On the other hand, more experienced pharmacists may lack recent education updates, resulting in knowledge gaps. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant correlation between training on AEDs and scoring&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50%, with the highest percentage of (52%) noted for those did not received training on AEDs. While training is typically thought to enhance knowledge, this data shows that training is linked to low knowledge scores. This discordances can be explained by the individuals lacking training may depend on recent personal learning updates or self-education. On the other hand, the effectiveness and substance of training programs could be inadequate. Therefore, further research should be implemented particularly to answer why trained pharmacists have low knowledge compared to untrained pharmacist. The result of this study was inconsistent with that presented in a cross-sectional study conducted among community and hospitals pharmacists in Palestine, multiple logistic regressions revealed that training on epilepsy and AEDs more likely to achieved&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50% than those who did not receive training on AEDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and in descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among community pharmacists in Khartoum State, Sudan, which revealed that having a higher degree in pharmacy (MSc or PhD) is the only factor that was significantly associated with good knowledge, with scores&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50% on the 10-item test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These results highlight the importance of continuous professional development efforts and specific training programs to improve pharmacists&#x02019; understanding of AEDs. It is crucial to address any educational and training deficiencies in different practice environments to ensure that pharmacists are properly prepared to manage patients effectively in this field. Moreover, future research could further investigate the causes of these differences and assess how various training methods affect knowledge retention and its application in practice.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Study strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par44">The strengths of this study include the following: This study covered four states in Sudan, making it more representative of Sudanese pharmacies. We did not allow pharmacists to use any resources to find answers to the survey questions in this study. The limitations of this study include the following: the use of a cross-sectional study design represents one point in time and restricts the ability to track changes in knowledge over time; the use of convenience sampling may not represent the overall population; and self-reporting can result in biased responses for a number of reasons, such as social desirability bias, where people give answers that they think are more positive or acceptable than their actual actions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par45">This study revealed that the majority of pharmacists in Sudan had a poor level of knowledge about AEDs. The level of knowledge was associated with years of experience, whether the respondent was a community or hospital pharmacist, and training on antiepileptic drugs. The results of this study highlight the need for pharmacists to have more training and more exposure to epilepsy and its management. Therefore, we recommend [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] providing and executing extensive training courses for pharmacists that are geared toward AEDs and appropriate for both community and hospital pharmacies; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] including courses concerning AEDs in continuing education and professional development requirements for pharmacists; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] encouraging pharmacists to take part in online courses, workshops, and seminars to stay current in new advancements; and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] carrying out longitudinal research to evaluate pharmacists&#x02019; knowledge of AEDs, identify gaps, and assess the effectiveness of interventions over time.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>YBH, FOA, SAM, and AAA were involved in the conception and design of the study.
