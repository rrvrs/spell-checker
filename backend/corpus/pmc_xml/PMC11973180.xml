Despite the clinical success of bone prostheses, complications remain, which can result in both implant failure and the need for revision surgery. Aseptic loosening due to inadequate osseointegration at the bone&#x02013;implant interface is a major complication, accounting for over half of implant failures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In general, osseointegration includes the direct deposition of regenerated bone on the implant surface and the consequent formation of solid bone-to-implant anchors without fibrous interference, emphasizing the importance of satisfactory peri-implant bone regeneration in osseointegration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In recent decades, titanium and its alloys have become the leading materials for orthopaedic implants because of their improved biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, titanium-based implants are considered biologically inert and require surface modifications to provide sufficient bioactivity for osseointegration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Traditional surface modifications often involve tuning hierarchical structures and extracellular matrix (ECM) functions <italic>via</italic> physiochemical or biomimetic approaches to promote osteogenesis. However, the clinical efficacy of such implants has been impeded by the discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Recently, extensive osteoimmunology research has demonstrated that titanium-based implant surfaces that are nanotopographically modified, have increased hydrophilicity or are modified with bioactive peptides can facilitate M2 macrophage polarization and promote peri-implant bone regeneration in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Although recent data suggest the potential for clinical application, enhanced interfacial osseointegration remains to be accomplished<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying bone regeneration will offer viable insights for the development of innovative bioactive surfaces, thereby ensuring improved implant osseointegration.</p><p id="Par4">Implant-mediated bone regeneration is a multifaceted physiological process that involves various cells and factors and comprises three stages, inflammation, proliferation and remodeling, over consecutive timeframes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. During the inflammation stage, a hematoma rapidly forms surrounding the implant surface and triggers the release of inflammatory mediators. Macrophages recruited to the implant site produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and degrade the ECM to facilitate bone reconstruction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In response to microenvironmental signals, they undergo distinct M1&#x02013;M2 polarization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. M1 macrophages secrete high levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&#x003b2;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Prolonged M1 polarization induces transformation of acute inflammation into a chronic state with the subsequent formation of peri-implant fibrous capsule leading to implant failures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Conversely, M2 macrophages express high levels of anti-inflammatory markers such as cluster of differentiation 206 (CD206), arginase-1 (Arg-1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Increased M2 macrophage polarization promotes the transition from the inflammation stage to the proliferation stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. During the proliferation stage, neovascularization serves as a crucial connector between the bone and surrounding tissues to facilitate the transport of oxygen, nutrients, and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) to the implant site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Moreover, the local release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and osteogenic growth peptide (OGP) promotes angiogenesis and BMSC osteogenic differentiation, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Once the inflammation and proliferation stages progress properly, the remodeling stage will follow smoothly to complete bone regeneration. A thorough understanding of the physiological process of bone regeneration provides valuable insights to improve osseointegration, as the implant surface should be functionally designed to align with the temporal sequence of the bone regeneration process.</p><p id="Par5">In this work, we develop an inflammation-responsive multifunctional coating using four peptides that correspond to the sequential targets of the described stages: (1) K23 (KAFAKLAARLYRKALARQLGVAA), an anti-inflammatory peptide for immune regulation during the inflammation stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>; (2) PVGLIG, an MMP-2/9-cleavable peptide for application during the inflammation stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>; (3) K15 (KLTWQELYQLKYKGI), a VEGF-mimetic peptide for angiogenesis promotion during the proliferation stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>; and (4) Y5 (YGFGG), an OGP-derived peptide for osteogenesis promotion during the proliferation stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A&#x02013;C</xref>). We assemble these peptides to construct a peptide-coated titanium-based coating (DOPA-P1@P2) by combining a mussel-inspired biomimetic strategy with bioorthogonal click chemistry techniques. Upon implantation, the outermost K23 layer modulates acute inflammation at the first stage of bone regeneration, facilitating M1 to M2 macrophage polarization. Moreover, the MMP-2/9 released by activated macrophages cleaves the PVGLIG sequence, resulting in detachment of the K23 layer and exposure of the underlying K15 and Y5 layers to promote angiogenesis and osteogenesis at the second stage and subsequent bone remodeling (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F&#x02013;H</xref>). In summary, DOPA-P1@P2 effectively promotes bone regeneration by intentionally aligning with the physiological process of bone regeneraiton, thereby enhancing osseointegration at the bone&#x02013;implant interface through sequential regulation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>The synthesis of DOPA-P1@P2 and its promotion of osseointegration via temporal regulation of bone regeneration.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Mussel-inspired peptide modified with a bioclickable DBCO group: (DOPA)<sub>4</sub>-OEG<sub>5</sub>-DBCO. <bold>B</bold> Azide-modified multifunctional peptide P1 with angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties: N<sub>3</sub>-K15-PVGLIG-K23. <bold>C</bold> Azide-modified multifunctional peptide P2 with osteogenic and anti-inflammatory properties: N<sub>3</sub>-Y5-PVGLIG-K23. <bold>D</bold> Mussel-inspired peptides bind to titanium surfaces through spontaneous coordination between catechol groups and titanium ions, while P1 and P2 are grafted onto biomimetic titanium surfaces via a bioorthogonal click chemistry reaction between N<sub>3</sub> and DBCO. <bold>E</bold> The preparation process of the biomimetic coating (DOPA-P1@P2). <bold>F</bold> DOPA-P1@P2 promotes M2 macrophage polarization during the first stage of bone regeneration. <bold>G</bold> DOPA-P1@P2 promotes angiogenesis and osteogenesis during the second stage of bone regeneration. <bold>H</bold> In the third stage of bone regeneration, the implant interface achieves satisfactory osseointegration.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2025_58444_Fig1_HTML" id="d33e411"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Titanium surface modification and material characterization</title><p id="Par6">To engineer an inflammation-responsive biomimetic titanium surface that can orchestrate bone regeneration, we initially synthesized a mussel-inspired peptide ((DOPA)<sub>4</sub>-OEG<sub>5</sub>-DBCO) bearing a clickable dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) group via solid-phase peptide synthesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1D</xref>). In this work, we employed readily available Fmoc-DOPA (acetone)-OH to incorporate DOPA into the peptide chain. To ensure that the mussel-inspired peptide adheres to titanium surfaces and allows subsequent bioorthogonal click reactions, we separated the tetrameric DOPA structures with glycine (Gly), lysine (Lys), and OEG-linked DBCO, resulting in the clickable biomimetic peptide Ac-(DOPA)-Gly-(DOPA)-Lys[(OEG<sub>5</sub>)-(DBCO-COOH)]-(DOPA)-Gly-(DOPA) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>). The chemical structure of (DOPA)<sub>4</sub>-OEG<sub>5</sub>-DBCO was analyzed via proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H NMR) spectroscopy, confirming the presence of a DOPA unit by identifying a distinctive peak at 8.64 ppm attributed to the phenolic hydrogens of the catechol group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref>). To meet the functional demands of various stages of bone regeneration, four types of peptides are introduced for surface modification: (1) the anti-inflammatory sequence K23, KAFAKLAARLYRKALARQLGVAA; (2) the angiogenic sequence K15, KLTWQELYQLKYKGI; (3) the osteogenic sequence Y5, YGFGG; and (4) the inflammatory response sequence, PVGLIG. The inflammatory response sequence PVGLIG was placed between K23 and K15, as well as between K23 and Y5, to generate two composite peptide sequences that were subsequently modified with two-azidoacetic acid (-N3). This process yielded two azide-modified composite functional peptides capable of inducing an inflammatory response: P1 (N<sub>3</sub>-K15-PVGLIG-K23) and P2 (N<sub>3</sub>-Y5-PVGLIG-K23) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B&#x02013;C</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1B</xref>&#x02013;C and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2A&#x02013;B</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Material characterization of modified surfaces.</title><p><bold>A&#x02013;C</bold> Schematic representations of the (DOPA)<sub>4</sub>-OEG<sub>5</sub>-DBCO, P1 and P2 structures. <bold>D&#x02013;F</bold> The HPLC spectra of (DOPA)<sub>4</sub>-OEG<sub>5</sub>-DBCO, P1, and P2 show purities exceeding 96%. <bold>G&#x02013;I</bold> ESI-MS spectra of (DOPA)<sub>4</sub>-OEG<sub>5</sub>-DBCO, P1, and P2. <bold>J</bold> The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of (DOPA)<sub>4</sub>-OEG<sub>5</sub>-DBCO displays characteristic peaks (<bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>f</bold>) with corresponding area integrations highlighted in blue.

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#x02013;MS) evaluated the molecular masses of these peptides. The findings suggested that the monoisotopic masses [M&#x02009;+&#x02009;2H]<sup>2+</sup> of (DOPA)<sub>4</sub>-OEG<sub>5</sub>-DBCO, [M&#x02009;+&#x02009;6H]<sup>6+</sup> of P1, and [M&#x02009;+&#x02009;5H]<sup>5+</sup> of P2 were 799.82, 834.32, and 718.65&#x02009;Da, respectively; these findings are in alignment with the theoretical molecular masses of the peptides (1597.67, 5000.03, and 3588.28&#x02009;Da, respectively) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2G&#x02013;I</xref>). These findings verified the successful production of mussel-inspired peptides and two composite functional peptides. An inflammation-responsive biomimetic titanium surface was then developed in two key steps. Initially, titanium plates or rods were submerged in a 0.01&#x02009;mg/mL (DOPA)<sub>4</sub>-OEG<sub>5</sub>-DBCO solution, enabling coating with mussel-inspired peptides. In the second step, these peptide-coated plates or rods were separately immersed in 0.1&#x02009;mg/mL solutions of P1, P2, or a 1:1 mixture of both, enabling the creation of a variety of modified surfaces through bioorthogonal click chemistry reactions between -DBCO and -N<sub>3</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D&#x02013;E</xref>). A 1:1 ratio of P1 to P2 was chosen on the basis of preliminary experimental results (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3A&#x02013;G</xref>), as this ratio enabled the modified surface to exhibit both angiogenic and osteogenic capabilities. Plates or rods immersed in PBS were designated the TiO<sub>2</sub> group and served as the control. Plates or rods immersed only in the mussel-inspired peptide solution were classified as the DOPA group, whereas those further grafted with P1, P2, or their mixture were classified as the DOPA-P1, DOPA-P2, and DOPA-P1@P2 groups, respectively.</p><p id="Par8">Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to assess the topography across various surfaces, revealing a significant increase in the roughness of surfaces modified with peptides compared with that of the TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2K, L</xref>). Interestingly, additional grafting of P1 or P2 onto DOPA-modified surfaces further enhances their roughness, likely due to variations in the peptide chain length or conformation. Subsequent analysis using static water contact angle measurements to evaluate the hydrophilicity across various surfaces, showed that the peptide-modified surfaces exhibited significantly lower water contact angles compared to the TiO<sub>2</sub> group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2M, N</xref>). More precisely, the DOPA-P1@P2 group exhibited a significantly lower water contact angle (55.6&#x000b0;) compared to TiO<sub>2</sub> group (81.1&#x000b0;), indicating improved surface hydrophilicity. The compositions of various modified surface elements were characterized via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2O&#x02013;P</xref>, surfaces modified with mussel-inspired peptides presented a notable increase in the N 1&#x02009;<italic>s</italic> signal relative to that of the TiO<sub>2</sub> group, with additional grafting of P1, P2, or their mixture further amplifying this signal, consistent with the amino content on these surfaces. To confirm that the peptides grafted onto the titanium surfaces remained stable and retained long-term activity, the DOPA-P1@P2 surfaces were incubated in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for three weeks prior to XPS analysis. The results revealed that the N 1&#x02009;<italic>s</italic> signal decreased by less than 15% after three weeks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2Q</xref>), indicating that the modified surface retained long-term biological activity. In this work, we utilized MMP-2 to simulate the local microenvironment during the inflammatory phase of bone regeneration and investigated the responsive release trends of an anti-inflammatory peptide (K23) from surfaces P1 and P2. The findings indicated that treatment with MMP-2 markedly enhances the release of K23 due to the specific enzymatic cleavage of the PVGLIG peptide sequence. Specifically, within the initial 24&#x02009;h after MMP-2 treatment, the release rate of K23 exceeded 60%; the release rate then significantly slowed after day 3, and by the end of week 1, the release rate was approximately 85% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2R</xref>). These findings demonstrate that modified titanium surfaces release substantial amounts of anti-inflammatory peptides early in inflammation to modulate immune responses, with K23 nearly depleted within 1 week. During the process of K23 release, its underlying angiogenic peptide sequence (K15) and osteogenic peptide sequence (Y5) become progressively exposed, thereby contributing to the second stage of bone regeneration. In summary, we effectively developed an inflammation-responsive biomimetic titanium surface (DOPA-P1@P2), which holds potential for the sequential regulation of bone regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Evaluation of biocompatibility</title><p id="Par9">In this study, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were used as research subjects to evaluate cytocompatibility of DOPA-P1@P2 across different cell types. Initially, live/dead staining experiments were performed, revealing that all three cell types exhibited robust survival on the various modified surfaces. Furthermore, there were no notable differences in the ratios of live to dead cells across the five groups: TiO<sub>2</sub>, DOPA, DOPA-P1, DOPA-P2, and DOPA-P1@P2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A&#x02013;C</xref>). We subsequently quantified the secretion of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) from the aforementioned three cell types seeded on various modified surfaces to assess their cytotoxicity. Following a 24-h incubation period, the detected levels of LDH did not significantly differ among the groups, indicating that the peptide-modified surfaces exhibited no toxicity towards the cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3E&#x02013;G</xref>). Additionally, the absorbance at 450&#x02009;nm for three different cell types on various modified surfaces was measured at 24 and 72&#x02009;h using CCK-8 assays (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3H&#x02013;M</xref>). The findings indicated that, by day 3, the absorbance at 450&#x02009;nm on the four modified surfaces (DOPA, DOPA-P1, DOPA-P2, and DOPA-P1@P2) was higher compared to the TiO<sub>2</sub> control surface, suggesting that peptide modifications of titanium surfaces significantly promote cell proliferation. Finally, after a 12-h cultivation period, the morphological features of BMSCs on various substrates were analyzed via cytoskeletal staining, employing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-phalloidin and 4&#x02019;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The findings demonstrated that on TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces, BMSCs mostly displayed a spherical shape with scant filopodia, while on peptide-modified surfaces, the cells adopted polygonal forms and showed increased expression of filamentous actin (F-actin), particularly prominent in the DOPA-P1@P2 group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). The materials characterization results suggest that the DOPA-P1@P2 surfaces, compared to the TiO<sub>2</sub> group, exhibit significantly increased roughness and hydrophilicity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2K&#x02013;N</xref>), which may explain the enhanced adhesion and spreading of BMSCs. Besides in vitro assays, we performed in vivo validation experiments in Sprague&#x02013;Dawley (SD) rats. We implanted modified titanium rods into rat femurs, and after two months, organs were analysed via haematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining. The results confirmed that all the modified surfaces were free from visceral toxicity (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). In brief, the findings derived from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the developed peptide-coated surfaces enhance cellular adhesion and proliferation and are nontoxic to organisms, establishing the necessary foundation for regulating bone regeneration.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Cytocompatibility assessment of modified surfaces.</title><p><bold>A&#x02013;C</bold> Live/dead staining of BMDMs, HUVECs, and BMSCs on modified surfaces. <bold>D</bold> Cytoskeletal staining of BMSCs on modified surfaces using FITC-phalloidin and DAPI. <bold>E&#x02013;G</bold> LDH cytotoxicity assays for BMDMs, HUVECs, and BMSCs cultured on modified surfaces (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 per group). <bold>H&#x02013;M</bold> CCK-8 assays for BMDMs, HUVECs, and BMSCs cultured on modified surfaces over 1 and 3 days (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 per group).

This question highlights the primary innovation of our research, which is the development of inflammation-responsive modified titanium surfaces that regulate the process of bone regeneration in an orderly manner to achieve satisfactory osseointegration.

Finally, a subset of femurs containing titanium rods was decalcified, after which the titanium rods were carefully removed for subsequent Masson and immunohistochemical staining.

However, these physical approaches often suffer from significant molecular leakage and face challenges in maintaining long-term bioactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, thereby limiting their practical application. On the other hand, conventional chemical modification methods often involve complex reactions and tedious surface treatment procedures, with limited controllability and operability, particularly in the development of multifunctional surface modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Thus, developing a simple and efficient surface modification technique capable of conjugating multiple bioactive molecules is critically important. Inspired by the adhesion mechanism of marine mussel foot proteins (Mfps), mussel-inspired bioinspired strategies have emerged as highly promising surface modification approaches, leveraging the repetitive catecholamine structure of DOPA in Mfps to achieve strong adhesion on nearly all types of surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

The prolonged dominance of M1 macrophages at the implant site leads to the sustained release of inflammatory mediators, which results in a shift from acute inflammation postimplantation to chronic inflammation.

Upon implantation, the outermost K23 layer modulates acute inflammation during the first stage of bone regeneration, facilitating macrophage polarization from the M1 phenotype to the M2 phenotype. Activated macrophages continuously secrete MMP-2 and MMP-9, which specifically cleave PVGLIG sequences. This leads to detachment of the outermost K23 layer, exposing the underlying K15 and Y5 layers. These layers promote angiogenesis and osteogenesis during the second stage, followed by bone remodeling. This inflammation-responsive biomimetic surface not only supports immunomodulation, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis during bone regeneration but also coordinates these functions across different stages, achieving improved osseointegration at the bone&#x02013;implant interface.

The remaining ten rats in each group were administered an intraperitoneal injection of 10&#x02009;mg/kg calcein (Sigma) 10 days and 3 days prior to euthanasia. All the rats were euthanized two months after surgery, and their bilateral femurs, hearts, livers, spleens, lungs, and kidneys were obtained for additional research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Peptide synthesis and surface modification</title><p id="Par31">The mussel-inspired peptide (DOPA)<sub>4</sub>-OEG<sub>5</sub>-DBCO, which features multiple DOPA units and DBCO groups, and two azide-modified composite functional peptides, P1 (N<sub>3</sub>-K15-PVGLIG-K23) and P2 (N<sub>3</sub>-Y5-PVGLIG-K23), were produced using the Fmoc solid-phase synthesis approach by ChinaPeptides Co., Ltd. (QYAOBIO). The corresponding molecular designs are as follows: Ac-(DOPA)-G-(DOPA)-K[(OEG<sub>5</sub>)-(DBCO-COOH)]-(DOPA)-G-(DOPA), (2-Azido)-KLTWQELYQLKYKGIPVGLIGKAFAKLAARLYRKALARQLGVAA, and (2-Azido)-YGFGGPVGLIGKAFAKLAARLYRKALARQLGVAA. Here, OEG was used as a spacer to reduce steric hindrance and facilitate reactions, whereas DBCO and Azido functioned as the groups that facilitated bioorthogonal reactions. Titanium plates, 1&#x02009;mm in thickness and 15&#x02009;mm in diameter, along with titanium rods, 10&#x02009;mm long and 1.5&#x02009;mm in diameter, were procured from Tianjin Zhengtian Medical Devices Co., Ltd., China. After being treated with oxygen plasma, the titanium rods and plates were cleaned three times with acetone, 75% alcohol, and deionized water, followed by sterilization under high temperature and pressure. To minimize amino acid oxidation, all peptide solutions were purged with nitrogen for 15&#x02009;min prior to use. Initially, sterile titanium plates and rods were submerged in a 0.01&#x02009;mg/mL solution of (DOPA)<sub>4</sub>-OEG<sub>5</sub>-DBCO for 48&#x02009;h to coat the titanium surface with mussel-inspired peptides through the spontaneous coordination of catechol groups and metal ions. The DBCO group in mussel-inspired peptides provides a click site for the subsequent grafting of peptides. Subsequently, surfaces modified with mussel-inspired peptides (defined as the DOPA group) were separately immersed in 0.1&#x02009;mg/mL solutions of P1, P2, or a 1:1 mixture of both for 4&#x02009;h, forming different modified surfaces (defined as the DOPA-P1, DOPA-P2, and DOPA-P1@P2 groups, respectively) through bioorthogonal click chemistry reactions between -DBCO and -N<sub>3</sub>. The plates or rods immersed in PBS were designated the TiO<sub>2</sub> group and served as the control. The surfaces with different modifications were meticulously cleaned with MiniQ water and subsequently dried under nitrogen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Material characterization</title><p id="Par32">The purities of (DOPA)<sub>4</sub>-OEG<sub>5</sub>-DBCO, P1 (N<sub>3</sub>-K15-PVGLIG-K23) and P2 (N<sub>3</sub>-Y5-PVGLIG-K23) were evaluated via HPLC, and their corresponding molecular weights were measured via ESI&#x02013;MS. The presence of specific catechol groups in the mussel-inspired peptides was subsequently detected via <sup>1</sup>H NMR. AFM was utilized to evaluate the surface morphology and quantify the roughness of the different groups. The hydrophilicity of the different groups was evaluated by measuring the static water contact angle. XPS was used to determine the elemental compositions of the different modified surfaces. The P1 and P2 surfaces were immersed in high-glucose DMEM without MMP-2 and with 1.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL MMP-2, respectively, and incubated at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The supernatants were collected at various time points, and the release trends of the PVGLIG peptide sequences were tracked using HPLC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par33">In this work, three distinct cell types were utilized for experimental investigation. HUVECs were supplied by the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). BMSCs were isolated from the femoral marrow of 4-week-old SD rats. In brief, the extraction of BMSCs required a relatively sterile environment. The bilateral femurs of the rats were collected, and the adjacent soft tissues were carefully removed. Subsequently, scissors were used to carefully cut both ends of the femur, and a 1&#x02009;ml syringe was used to flush the marrow cavity with culture medium repeatedly until the flushed medium became clear. The mixture was subsequently gathered and passed through a mesh filter. After filtration, the cell suspension was exposed to red blood cell lysis solution and then centrifuged. The resulting cells were resuspended and cultured in a dish. When the cell density in the culture dish reached approximately 80%, the cells were digested and passaged with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution (RG-CE-9, Ketu Biotech). BMDMs were isolated from the bone marrow of 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice following a procedure similar to that used for BMSCs. M-CSF (20&#x02009;ng/mL) was added to the culture medium to induce macrophage differentiation following cell seeding. HUVECs were cultured in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), with cell passages typically occurring every 1&#x02012;2 days. BMSCs were cultured in low-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, with cell passage typically performed every 2&#x02012;3 days. The BMDMs were cultured in high-glucose complete DMEM, with half the medium replaced every 2&#x02012;3 days, and fresh M-CSF was added. After 7 days, the cells were differentiated into macrophages for subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Cytocompatibility</title><p id="Par34">Three types of cells were seeded onto differently modified titanium surfaces and cultured for 24&#x02009;h, followed by staining using the Calcein&#x02013;AM/PI Double Stain Kit (Yeasen, China). The cells were cultured on different modified surfaces for 24&#x02009;h, and cytotoxicity was assessed via an LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Beyotime, China). Furthermore, the cells were cultured on diverse titanium surfaces, and cell proliferation was evaluated at 24 and 72&#x02009;h via a Cell Counting Kit-8 (Yeasen, China). Finally, we performed cytoskeletal staining with phalloidin (Yeasen, China) to assess the adhesion and spreading characteristics of BMSCs on different modified surfaces. Briefly, BMSCs cultured on various modified surfaces for 12&#x02009;h were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20&#x02009;min, incubated with FITC-labeled phalloidin for 30&#x02009;min, stained with DAPI for 10&#x02009;min, and subsequently imaged using a confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM800, Germany). Semiquantitative analysis was performed using ImageJ software (version 1.54&#x02009;d), with all the data analysed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Macrophage polarization</title><p id="Par35">BMDMs were distributed across various surfaces at 20,000 cells per surface and subjected to 8&#x02009;h of treatment with 100&#x02009;ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sourced from Sigma-Aldrich. Fresh DMEM was then added after replacing the old medium, and the cells were left to incubate for a further 48-h period. Following a 48-h incubation period, the supernatants from each group were collected, and ELISA kits were used to quantify the levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-10, VEGF, and BMP-2. Simultaneously, the collected cells were subjected to immunofluorescence staining to assess their polarization characteristics on different modified surfaces. The immunofluorescence staining procedure followed the instructions of the TSA kit (ABclonal, RK05903). Primary antibodies against F4/80 (Abcam, ab6640), iNOS (Abcam, ab178945), and CD206 (Abcam, ab64693) were used in this process. The polarization states of macrophages on various modified surfaces were analysed via flow cytometry, Western blotting (WB), and RT-qPCR. Detailed descriptions of the methods used for WB and RT-qPCR are provided in a subsequent section. Here, we briefly introduce the flow cytometry procedure. The cells from each group were collected and incubated for 30&#x02009;min with antibodies specific for F4/80 (Thermo, 11-4801-82), CD206 (Thermo, 17-2061-80), and CD86 (Thermo, 12-0862-81). After the samples were rinsed twice with PBS supplemented with 5% BSA, the cells were resuspended. Finally, the subsets of M1 and M2 macrophages within the different samples were identified using flow cytometry (Thermo Scientific, USA). Flow cytometry data were processed using FlowJo V10 software, and analyses were conducted in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Angiogenesis</title><p id="Par36">This experiment is divided into two parts: 1) the indirect angiogenic effects of modified surfaces and 2) the direct angiogenic effects of modified surfaces. To investigate whether various modified surfaces can modulate the immune microenvironment to indirectly promote angiogenesis, supernatants were collected from BMDMs cultured on these surfaces. Next, the supernatants collected from the BMDMs and fresh high-glucose DMEM were mixed in equal proportions to prepare conditioned medium (CM). HUVECs were plated in 6-well plates at a concentration of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well and cultured in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24&#x02009;h. The next day, when the cells reached confluence, they were treated with 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL mitomycin C (Sigma, M5353) for 1&#x02009;h. After creating a uniform scratch in each well, the cells were washed three times with PBS, and the medium was replaced with CM. The scratch width was observed under a microscope (Zeiss, Germany) at 0 and 24&#x02009;h. A migration assay was performed using a Transwell system (Corning, USA) to evaluate cell movement. HUVECs were plated at a concentration of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well in the upper chamber, while CM from different groups was added to the lower chamber for a 24-h incubation. To evaluate cell migration, the cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution (Solarbio, China). Ultimately, we performed an angiogenesis assay. Briefly, the ABW&#x000ae; Matrigel matrix was kept on ice and left to thaw overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. After thawing, the matrix was mixed at a 1:1 ratio with fresh, serum-free DMEM. Fifty microlitres of the solution was added to a 96-well plate and placed in a cell culture incubator for 40&#x02009;min to enable solidification. Next, HUVECs were introduced into a previously mentioned 96-well plate with 20,000 cells per well and incubated with CM from various modified surfaces. Tube formation in HUVECs was visualized at 4- and 24-&#x02013; time points. Additionally, HUVECs were incubated in 6-well plates with CM from different groups. After 24&#x02009;h, RNA and proteins were extracted for RT-qPCR and WB analysis.</p><p id="Par37">Before confirming their direct angiogenic effects, the modified titanium surfaces were pretreated with a 1.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL MMP-2 solution for 72&#x02009;h to eliminate the influence of anti-inflammatory peptide sequences on the experiment. Subsequently, HUVECs were directly seeded onto the pretreated modified titanium surfaces and incubated for 24&#x02009;h in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The next day, after treatment with 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL mitomycin C for 1&#x02009;h, a uniform scratch was made on the modified titanium surface. Calcein&#x02013;AM staining was performed at 0 and 24&#x02009;h, and cell migration was analysed using an inverted fluorescence microscope. Since the titanium plates are impenetrable, we incorporated peptides from various modified titanium surfaces into DMEM and subsequently conducted migration and tube formation experiments using this peptide-enriched medium. A density of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well was used to seed HUVECs in the upper chamber, with peptide-enriched medium from different groups in the lower chamber for a 24-h incubation, and cell migration was assessed using 0.1% crystal violet solution (Solarbio, China). The procedure for the tube formation assay was the same as above, except that the CM was replaced with peptide-enriched medium. Prior to examination, the samples were treated with calcein&#x02013;AM and analysed using fluorescence microscopy. Finally, HUVECs were directly seeded onto titanium surfaces pretreated with MMP-2 for 72&#x02009;h. RNA and proteins were then extracted for RT-qPCR and WB analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Osteogenesis</title><p id="Par38">Similarly, experiments related to osteogenesis were conducted via two separate approaches: indirect and direct. First, to verify the indirect osteogenic effect of the surfaces, the supernatant from BMDMs incubated on various titanium surfaces was collected and mixed with fresh low-glucose DMEM at a 1:1 ratio to prepare macrophage CM. BMSCs were seeded in plates at a density of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well and incubated for 36&#x02009;h in low-glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS. The initial culture medium was replaced with CM containing osteogenic supplements, specifically 10&#x02009;mM &#x003b2;-glycerophosphate, 0.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M dexamethasone, and 0.25&#x02009;mM ascorbate. The media was changed every 2&#x02013;3 days. On day 7, ALP staining was performed, and on day 21, ARS staining was carried out. The procedures followed the standard protocols provided with the ALP Staining Kit (Beyotime, C3206) and the ARS Staining Kit (Beyotime, C0148S). After the BMSCs were incubated for 48&#x02009;h in CM containing osteogenic factors, immunofluorescence staining was conducted to quantify the expression levels of OPN (Immunoway, YT3467) in the different groups. Simultaneously, RNA and proteins were extracted from different groups for RT-qPCR and WB analysis.</p><p id="Par39">After the titanium plates were pretreated with 1.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL MMP-2 solution for 72&#x02009;h, BMSCs were directly seeded onto the pretreated titanium surfaces. The BMSCs were incubated in fresh low-glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS and osteogenic factors, and the medium was changed every 2&#x02013;3 days. After 48&#x02009;h, immunofluorescence staining was performed to assess the levels of COL-I (Abcam, ab270993) in the different groups. Simultaneously, RNA and proteins were extracted from different groups for RT-qPCR and WB analysis. Similarly, on days 7 and 21, ALP and ARS staining were performed directly on the incubated cells on the modified titanium surfaces.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>RT-qPCR and western blotting</title><p id="Par40">Total RNA was extracted from cells subjected to various treatments using TRIzol<sup>TM</sup> reagent (Thermo Fisher, 15596026CN). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from the extracted RNA through reverse transcription. The resulting cDNA was then amplified using a CFX96&#x02122; Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad, USA). The primers used for the target genes are detailed in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Total protein was extracted after various treatments and then measured for quantification. The proteins were subjected to SDS&#x02012;PAGE for 90&#x02009;min at 110&#x02009;V, followed by transfer onto PVDF membranes at 350&#x02009;mA for 30&#x02009;min. After blocking, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with primary antibodies targeting iNOS (Abcam, ab178945), CD206 (Abcam, ab64693), VEGF (Immunoway, YN5444), FGF-2 (Abcam, ab208687), COL-I (Abcam, ab270993), OPN (Immunoway, YT3467), and &#x003b2;-actin (Immunoway, YM3028). After thorough rinsing with TBST, the membranes were treated with appropriate secondary antibodies for one h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Micro-CT and biomechanical push-out experiments</title><p id="Par41">Two months postsurgery, all harvested femurs underwent micro-CT scans using a SkyScan 1176 system (Belgium). The femur of each rat was imaged with a spatial resolution of 18 &#x003bc;m per layer, with the voltage and current set at 50&#x02009;kV and 500 &#x003bc;A, respectively, and the rotational step was set at 0.7&#x000b0;. The micro-CT scan data were analysed using CTAn software, which was used to measure the bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm&#x000b3;), bone volume per tissue volume (BV/TV, %), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, &#x003bc;m) across various groups. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the CT data was performed to visually compare bone integration across the different groups. Five right femurs from each experimental group were subjected to biomechanical push-out testing. The maximum push-out force was evaluated utilizing the HY1080 material testing system (China). Before the mechanical tests, the femurs were fixed vertically to the base using dental cement. A force parallel to the femoral longitudinal axis was then applied to push the femurs downwards at a speed of 1&#x02009;mm/min, with the maximum push-out force recorded during the process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Histological evaluation</title><p id="Par42">Following biomechanical testing, the remaining five right femurs from each group, each containing a titanium rod, were dehydrated in 70% ethanol and subsequently used for hard tissue sectioning. The hard tissue sections containing titanium rods were subjected to van Gieson&#x02019;s (VG) staining to evaluate the variations in bone-to-implant contact (BIC) among the different groups. Concurrently, hard tissue sections labeled with calcein were examined to assess the differences in bone mineralization rates (MARs) between the groups. Ten remaining samples per group were harvested and subsequently immersed in a 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution (RG-TG-01, Ketu Biotech) to facilitate gradual decalcification. The entire process was carried out in a constant-temperature shaking incubator at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for five weeks. Upon completion of the decalcification process, the titanium rods were meticulously extracted from the femurs. The tissues were processed into paraffin sections for further study. Histological sections were meticulously prepared, and immunohistochemical staining was performed on these paraffin sections to measure the levels of COL-I and OPN. Collagen deposition around the titanium rods was also assessed via Masson staining. Additionally, the femurs of rats from each group, which were extracted on the fifth day postsurgery, were subjected to slow decalcification and processed into paraffin sections. These sections were initially stained with H&#x00026;E to assess fibroproliferation around the titanium rods. Immunohistochemical staining was subsequently carried out to evaluate the differences in the expression of TNF-&#x003b1; (Servicebio, GB11188) and IL-10 (Servicebio, GB11534) between the groups. Finally, immunofluorescence staining was performed using CD68 (Abcam, ab201340) to label macrophages, CD86 (Immunoway, YT7823) as a marker of M1 polarization, and CD206 (Abcam, ab64693) as a marker of M2 polarization. All the staining processes were performed following the standard protocols outlined by the reagent suppliers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Transcriptome sequencing</title><p id="Par43">We conducted two transcriptome sequencing analyses to explore the mechanisms of direct angiogenesis and direct osteogenesis on DOPA-P1@P2 surfaces.
