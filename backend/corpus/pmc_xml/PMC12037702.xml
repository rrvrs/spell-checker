Patients and caregivers consistently felt disconnected from their care teams and lacked sufficient information leading to uncertainty about their SNF admission and plans for recovery. Key conditions driving these outcomes were patient and care team processes, including interdisciplinary team&#x02010;based care, clinical training and practice norms, pressure to maintain hospital throughput, patient behaviours, the availability and provision of information, and patient's physical and emotional vulnerability. The relationships between conditions and processes were complex, dynamic and, at times, interrelated.</p></sec><sec id="hex70248-sec-0040"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has conceptualised the root causes of poor&#x02010;quality experiences within the hospital&#x02010;to&#x02010;SNF care transition.

In the United States, SNFs provide temporary transitional care for people who require rehabilitation and medical treatments after hospitalisation for an illness, injury or chronic condition [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The primary goal of short&#x02010;term rehabilitation at SNFs is for an individual to regain function and independence so that they can safely return home [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The prevalence and costs associated with this care transition will rapidly increase as the United States population ages [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Hospital&#x02010;to&#x02010;SNF transitions have previously been characterised as fragmented and ones that are marked by poor communication between patients, caregivers, hospital and SNF clinicians [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This results in gaps in hospital discharge planning, SNF admission processes and an overall poor&#x02010;quality transition experience [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This care transition can be a fraught time; studies have documented that patients are often inadequately prepared for discharge and unprepared for SNF care and their post&#x02010;acute care recovery [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This care transition causes considerable distress for patients and their caregivers [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Despite how common this care transition is and the consistent poor patient experiences reported, most research seeking to improve care transitions has focused on hospital discharges to home rather than to SNFs. Research that does exist focuses primarily on describing the experiences of either patients, caregivers or clinicians from their individual perspectives [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. What has not been as well examined are the <italic toggle="yes">drivers</italic> of these experiences and how these <italic toggle="yes">drivers</italic> of experiences are influenced by patients, caregivers and clinicians concurrently within the hospital and SNF setting. Drivers are defined as the factors and actions that directly lead to the experiences and outcomes [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] of patients and caregivers during this care transition. It is essential to understand the drivers of patients' and caregivers' hospital&#x02010;to&#x02010;SNF transition experiences so that specific improvement targets can be identified and gaps addressed. Only then can the provision of high&#x02010;quality, patient&#x02010;centred care&#x02014;which is a national and patient priority&#x02014;be realised [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

The Medicine Service includes 8 care teams (comprising hospitalist physicians, resident physicians and students) and 10 direct care hospitalist&#x02010;only services. The SNF is a post&#x02010;acute rehabilitation facility with approximately 90 beds for temporary short&#x02010;term stays. Other care team members at both sites are nurses, case managers and physical and occupational therapists. See Appendix&#x000a0;<xref rid="hex70248-suppl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">1</xref> for more details about study sites and the care delivered.</p></sec><sec id="hex70248-sec-0100"><label>2.3</label><title>Participants</title><p>Patient participants were eligible for interview if they were &#x02265;&#x02009;50 years old, English&#x02010;speaking without dementia and admitted to the SNF within 7 days from the AMC. We excluded patients &#x02264;&#x02009;49 years as they are less likely to be admitted to SNFs [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. People with Alzheimer's and related dementias (ADRD) were also excluded to maintain a more homogenous study sample and given the unique needs of these specific patient groups. Caregivers of eligible patients were also eligible. Patient and caregiver participants were eligible for ethnographic observations if they were &#x02265;&#x02009;18 years old and admitted to the Medicine Service or SNF. All adults were included in observations to ensure the feasibility of conducting observations in a busy hospital and SNF setting. Clinicians included hospital and SNF physicians, nurses, case managers and physical and occupational therapists.</p></sec><sec id="hex70248-sec-0110"><label>2.4</label><title>Recruitment</title><p>We utilised two sampling methods consistent with grounded theory, purposive and theoretical [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Firstly, we screened the SNFs' Electronic Health Record (EHR) to purposefully identify eligible patients and their caregivers who were then invited to participate in an interview during their SNF admission. A SNF staff member&#x02014;not involved in the patient's care&#x02014;approached patients and asked if they were interested in learning more about the study. If they were, a member of the research team would provide study information. Similarly, patients and caregivers were asked by a staff member not involved in their care before inviting them to be observed during care interactions. Purposive sampling was also used to invite clinicians by email and staff meetings to participate in interviews and observations. Once data collection had commenced, we used theoretical sampling to make additional recruitment decisions to further explore the range, variation and inter&#x02010;relationships of concepts from developing data analysis [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As approved by our IRB, all participants provided written informed consent for interviews and verbal informed consent for observations.</p></sec><sec id="hex70248-sec-0120"><label>2.5</label><title>Data Collection</title><p>The lead author conducted in&#x02010;depth face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face interviews at the SNF and ethnographic participant observations at the hospital and SNF. An interview guide was developed to explore participants' experiences and reflections on the hospital&#x02010;to&#x02010;SNF transition, focusing on discharge planning, expectation setting, the transition process, SNF admission and post&#x02010;hospital recovery (Appendix&#x000a0;<xref rid="hex70248-suppl-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>). Interviews were 45&#x02013;60&#x02009;min long and were digitally recorded and professionally transcribed. Ethnographic observations were embedded into day&#x02010;to&#x02010;day care activities, unobtrusively observing and taking notes of hospital and SNF care team processes and interactions between clinicians, patients and caregivers (e.g., communication, teamwork and non&#x02010;verbal cues) [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Observations occurred during the daytime (morning ward rounds, family meetings, interprofessional discharge meetings, SNF admissions and routine clinical care delivery). We did not observe at night, given transition planning and admission to SNF mainly occur during the day. To facilitate accurate recollection, following interviews and observations, we used guidelines for structuring field notes and memos [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Data collection and analysis continued until theoretical saturation&#x02014;the point at which additional data collection yielded no new properties or theoretical insights&#x02014;was achieved [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="hex70248-sec-0130"><label>2.6</label><title>Analysis</title><p>Data were collected and analysed simultaneously using constant comparison and dimensional analysis [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A defining feature of dimensional analysis is the creation of an explanatory matrix, which explores the prominent dimensions in the data and determines a central perspective from which to organise other key dimensions within the matrix's categories (i.e., context, conditions, processes and consequences) [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Context represents the setting or environment in which the phenomenon is embedded. Conditions facilitate, impede or influence the participants' central actions. Processes are actions shaped by the conditions, and consequences are the outcomes resulting from these processes.</p><p>The first step of analysis involved dimensionalizing, a type of open coding that summarises meanings or actions [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Codes were used to provisionally label dimensions and aspects of their properties. Initial codes included sensitising concepts [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which were existing reported problems related to SNF transitions (e.g., feeling unprepared [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]), as well as codes that were unique to the data. This was then followed by designation which expanded the analysis by exploring the breadth of dimensions of experience without consideration of their importance until sufficient dimensions were identified to represent the emerging concepts [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Sensitising concepts only remained if they were grounded in data [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Using analytic memos and team analysis meetings, dimensions were then differentiated by considering their relative significance until we distinguished a critical mass of codes that best described the salient dimensions of experience. Relationships between dimensions were then explored by creating an explanatory matrix, where several plausible dimensions were &#x02018;auditioned&#x02019; for their fit as key dimensions that explained the central perspective [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The initial goal when using the matrix was to hold possibilities open by giving several key dimensions an opportunity to serve as the central perspective. This central perspective enabled the integration of other key dimensions within the matrix according to their fit, such as context, conditions, processes and consequences. Data were managed using ATLAS.ti 9.0, and analysis was conducted by authors J.H., T.B. and A.L. We took several steps to ensure theoretical and methodological rigour and credibility throughout the analysis, including sustained immersion in the field, ensuring multivocality, writing memos on individual interviews and dimensions, triangulation of data sources, and frequent meetings with team members for analysis development and direct exploration of reflexivity and positionality [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="hex70248-sec-0140"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="hex70248-sec-0150"><label>3.1</label><title>Participants and Explanatory Matrix</title><p>We completed 41 interviews (15 patients, 5 caregivers and 15 hospital and 6 SNF clinicians) and 40&#x02009;h of ethnographic observations (30 in the hospital and 10 in the SNF). Study participants' characteristics are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="hex70248-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. We configured the explanatory matrix around the central perspective: &#x02018;They were talking to each other, but not to me&#x02019; given patients and caregivers consistently noted they felt disconnected from their care team, lacked sufficient information, and experienced uncertainty about their admission to an SNF and long&#x02010;term recovery. In Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="hex70248-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, we visualise this matrix and generate a theory detailing the context and conditions that drive key processes and actions of patients, caregivers and clinicians that cause the challenges experienced by patients and caregivers during this care transition.

<italic toggle="yes">Patient and caregiver behaviours</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">limited information availability</italic> were distinct but related conditions impacting key transition processes and drove how and why patients and caregivers responded to illness and engaged in care. These behaviours were often a result of whether information was made available or not to them. The delivery of verbal information regarding hospital discharge planning and SNF admission typically occurred during in&#x02010;person interactions with care team members. Written information was provided in a hospital discharge summary or within an admissions folder located in each patient's room at the SNF. Information, though, was delivered inconsistently in each care setting. The final conditions were <italic toggle="yes">physical and emotional vulnerability</italic>. Hospitalisation and post&#x02010;acute care exposed the vulnerability of physical health, while the emotional vulnerability was a result of the unfamiliar clinical environments that patients had entered to receive care and rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec id="hex70248-sec-0180"><label>3.4</label><title>Patient and Caregiver Processes and Actions</title><p>There were four key processes and actions of patients and caregivers.

They could not recall discussions with other clinicians. Patients' and caregivers' view of clinical care reflected physician&#x02010;led care and not team&#x02010;based care. Despite patients and caregivers not recalling information given to them by other care team members, case managers were observed to have a clear process for partnering with patients during discharge planning.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>&#x02018;From the start to finish we gather information about the patient's clinical care and readiness for discharge. Then we do a Case Management Assessment&#x02026;their demographics, where they live, who their support system is, what services may have already been set up for them, as well as reviewing insurance information. We then ask them what they foresee as their goal for discharge and what they want to do based on the recommendations that we are seeing in the hospital. Then we work with the patient to achieve this&#x02019;.</p><attrib>Hospital case manager</attrib></disp-quote>
</p><p>Confusion with team&#x02010;based care impacted patients' and caregivers' ability to retain information. In many instances they were unable to distinguish the large number of clinicians entering their room. This was further hindered because everyone wore similar coloured scrubs or masks. While care team members would introduce themselves by name and role, this often did not improve patients' ability to understand.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>&#x02018;It's very confusing to be in the hospital. There are three teams that were dealing with me &#x02013; the medical team, the surgical team, and I guess the other people who take care of me, whatever that's called. I had people coming in and out. I didn't know who was who, or whom I was supposed to talk to. I didn't know who was in charge.&#x02019;</p><attrib>Patient</attrib></disp-quote>
</p></sec><sec id="hex70248-sec-0200"><label>3.4.2</label><title>Being a Passive Participant in Healthcare</title><p>The most common patient behaviour observed was being a passive participant in their healthcare. This was not a choice but a behaviour rooted in the belief of how the patient&#x02013;clinician relationship should be. It was also a result of the fact that patients and caregivers were often not invited to share their priorities. Many patients described how they did their best to be &#x02018;a very good patient&#x02019; or explained that &#x02018;I'm an easy patient to be around&#x02019;, so they were surprised that information about the SNF and their recovery trajectory was not forthcoming. Others noted that they &#x02018;kept quiet&#x02019; or did not want to ask questions as they &#x02018;did not want to be burden on their care team, or slow down them down as they were already busy enough and overextended&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="hex70248-sec-0210"><label>3.4.3</label><title>Being Unseen and Not Heard by the Healthcare Team</title><p>A combination of patient behaviours (e.g., being a passive participant) and limited information provision led to patients' feeling unseen and not heard. Bedside rounds were a specific time during hospitalisation when patients hoped they would be able to connect with physicians. However, bedside rounds were time&#x02010;limited and left patients feeling unseen, unheard and without the information they wanted. For example, one patient did not want to be in the hospital for her birthday and had questions about discharge options. However, the team was unable to answer all her questions as they needed to keep moving and see other patients. The team began to edge out of the room, taking steps backwards to slowly move away from the patient as she continued her conversation, peppering them with questions. This process was repeated throughout rounds and reflected the lack of time available to develop connections in a way patients desired. Many patients and caregivers felt part of a clinical process that did not consider their individuality outside of their medical or rehabilitation needs.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>&#x02018;I think sometimes we focus on we're going to transfer you in a wheelchair van, and we're going to get you there. When you get there, they're going to do an assessment, you'll meet with their physical therapist and occupational therapist. I feel like that kind of stuff is very boilerplate because those are requirements that they're legally bound to be covered by insurance. But the stuff that makes the real difference in the quality of the patient's overall well&#x02010;being is holistically looking at the patient.

As noted, team&#x02010;based care also had direct implications for patients, impacting their ability to retain information due to confusion and misunderstanding of this structure of care.

<italic toggle="yes">Clinical training and practice norms</italic> were conditions that created normalised care practices.

</p></sec><sec id="hex70248-sec-0260"><label>3.6.2</label><title>Checklist Driven Care and Standardised Workflows</title><p>The use of checklists and standardised workflows was normalised and used for almost every part of discharge planning and admission to an SNF.

</p><p>Another checklist driving care was the patient problem list, which is a list of a patient's medical and social problems. However, problem lists were derived from the clinicians' perspective, meaning they did not include patient&#x02010;reported topics or priorities. The use of checklists was common for all clinicians. As described by a nurse, the hospital nurse&#x02010;to&#x02010;SNF nurse handoff involved a standardised approach that noticeably focused on medical and clinical topics.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>&#x02018;I typically start with generic information about the patient&#x02014;allergies, code status, when they were admitted, why they were admitted; a brief course of the patient, like this was the problem &#x02026;this is how we've been managing them.

</p></sec><sec id="hex70248-sec-0270"><label>3.6.3</label><title>Creating Medical Stability</title><p>The creation of medical stability was also influenced by all three clinician conditions. A hospitalist's primary role through their training was to address a patient's acute illness so they can be discharged. In contrast, health systems wanted this process to be as efficient as possible in freeing up beds for new patients. SNF physicians recognised that the hospital teams focused on medical stability but suggested that this only addressed some factors impacting a patient's recovery and the information that they needed.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>&#x02018;I am fascinated in how the medical side is always just the top of the iceberg. By the time they come to a post&#x02010;acute setting, that tip has already been managed ad nauseam. There are still issues that inevitably arise.

</p><p>The prioritisation of medical stability during the preparation for discharge illustrated why patients were so confident in recounting their medical issues but not confident about what SNF care and recovery would look like, given this was not often discussed.</p></sec><sec id="hex70248-sec-0280"><label>3.6.4</label><title>Communication Gaps</title><p>Team&#x02010;based care resulted in gaps in communication about which clinical tasks were completed and why they were completed. Communication gaps were exacerbated due to throughput pressures.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>&#x02018;Sometimes it feels like the medical team have no idea how their patients are doing functionally. They just want to know what rehab recommends. They don't really know why we're recommending. It feels like we work in silos &#x02010; the medical team is managing them medically, we're managing them physically and functionally and nursing is doing everything.

</p><p>To address gaps in team communication, multidisciplinary rounds (MDRs) were held daily during the patient's hospitalisation. MDR was a time for care team members to discuss care and discharge planning. Notably, rarely were all members of the care team present at MDR due to the feasibility of scheduling and competing clinical demands. Physicians and case managers who typically attended MDR acknowledged that patients' individual needs and concerns were usually not discussed in detail.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>&#x02018;MDR is 10&#x02009;minutes, and teams can have from 6 to 14 patients. The nitty&#x02010;gritty details of how the transition is going to go for a patient, what matters most, what their preferences are&#x02014;you might hear quick one&#x02010;liners, 30&#x02009;seconds, one minute, about it. But MDR is about running through, patient&#x02010;by&#x02010;patient, high&#x02010;level plans.&#x02019;</p><attrib>Hospitalist</attrib></disp-quote>
</p><p>Nurses also identified morning rounds as a missed opportunity for team communication. This resulted in nurses being unable to complete key parts of their role, which was to provide bedside education, counselling or reinforcement of elements of the transition planning.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>&#x02018;It's difficult because we don't have it set up to where we do rounds together. I try to keep an eye out for when the team comes so that I can round with them, so that I can be part of that process. But most of the time, the physicians come by in rounds, and we don't even know that they've been there. So, we miss out on those conversations with them and the families&#x02019;.</p><attrib>Hospital nurse</attrib></disp-quote>

They acknowledged they did not feel qualified to do so. Hospital clinicians identified gaps in their training and clinical knowledge as reasons why they failed to inform patients about care at SNFs or long&#x02010;term recovery. Specifically, their training and focus on inpatient care meant they did not follow patients longitudinally to be able to see the range of potential patient outcomes following hospitalisation. This lack of a feedback loop impacted their confidence in providing prognosis predictions about patients' recovery arc and outcomes.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>&#x02018;We learn these patterns over time after seeing hundreds and thousands of patients. But if you're a hospitalist your thousands of patients with a hip fracture ends at the time that you discharge them.

They're understanding how to manage this short time in someone's life, which is sometimes just days in the hospital, but they don't understand the impact of their decisions on long&#x02010;term outcomes because they're just not seeing those patterns&#x02019;.</p><attrib>Hospital geriatrician</attrib></disp-quote>

</p><p>Patients and caregivers lacked knowledge about what to expect in terms of the SNF care they would receive. The &#x02018;step down in care&#x02019; that existed between a hospital and an SNF was surprising and concerning. An SNF nurse reflected on this mismatch of expectations:<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>&#x02018;This goes back to the expectation setting. For many of the patients it's their first time at SNF. Patients come thinking that it's going to be like a hospital and that's not the case. Patients may think that they'll be seen more often. Whereas inpatients are often seen daily by the team that's taking care of them, here, our medical providers follow&#x02010;up once weekly. If there is an acute issue they are seen more frequently&#x02019;</p><attrib>SNF nurse</attrib></disp-quote>

For others, when choices were available based on better insurance coverage, they felt rushed in making an important life decision.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p>&#x02018;There is not a lot of time to make that decision.

</p></sec><sec id="hex70248-sec-0330"><label>3.7.3</label><title>Wanting Time With the Healthcare Team</title><p>Patients and caregivers wanted more time with clinicians. This was partly to help them prepare and understand post&#x02010;acute care and their recovery potential, but it was also about having individual connections with their care team. The sentiments of one patient captured how many felt; &#x02018;No one has the time to sit and talk with you in the way that you would want them to&#x02019;. Another patient noted that the hospital team &#x02018;were talking to each other, but not to me.&#x02019; Poor communication resulted in feelings of disconnection between patients and their care team.</p></sec><sec id="hex70248-sec-0340"><label>3.7.4</label><title>Limited Recall of Information</title><p>Patients and caregivers commonly reported that they could not recall information given to them.

Our study extends our understanding of these consistently reported experiences by uncovering the dynamic relationships between distinct contextual factors and conditions that shape key processes and actions of patients, caregivers and clinicians that ultimately influence these experiences. Most research investigating the hospital&#x02010;to&#x02010;SNF care transition has explored the perspective of one key informant group, typically from one care setting. In contrast, this current study has included patients, caregivers and clinicians from both hospitals and SNFs, and therefore, it accurately reflects the combined influences of all informants on this care transition. Using dimensional analysis, we have created an explanatory matrix that has theoretical implications given the conceptualisation of the root causes of problems within this common and significant care transition (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="hex70248-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This theory generation identifies targets for clinical practice improvement, tailored intervention development and medical education innovations. This has practical implications for improvement efforts, which we will now discuss.</p><p>Team&#x02010;based care was a condition that had significant implications on clinicians' practice and patient processes. Team&#x02010;based care can meet value&#x02010;based care goals, reduce clinician burnout and improve efficiency, safety, quality and patient satisfaction [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, despite these benefits, the hospital&#x02010;to&#x02010;SNF transition created confusion and increased the likelihood of communication failings. As with other studies of hospitalised patients [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], we found that patients were unaware of who was responsible for leading their care and providing them with key information. While efforts have focused on improving understanding of their care team members' names and professional roles [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], this does not fully address the problem. Patients and caregivers in our study misunderstood the fundamental premise of a team care model whereby care, information and support could be delivered by any care team member, not just physicians. Strategies to change how patients perceive and interpret team&#x02010;based care are required to clearly articulate, and that is demonstrated in practice, a flatter and less hierarchical organisational structure that supports the intended goals of team&#x02010;based care.</p><p>Creating processes to optimally deliver information to patients by care teams will only solve part of the knowledge gap experienced by patients. The content of information must also be tailored to a patient's individual needs and circumstances. However, addressing information needs would present challenges based on our results and others which have found that most hospital clinicians, by their own admission, lacked sufficient knowledge about post&#x02010;acute SNF care to adequately advise patients and set realistic expectations about potential recovery trajectories [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our study adds to the urgent calls to improve clinical education, training and professional development for hospital&#x02010;based clinicians on post&#x02010;acute care [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A novel finding from our study was that clinicians, regardless of the clinical setting, found it challenging to discuss patients' potential post&#x02010;hospital and post&#x02010;SNF rehabilitation prognosis, function and outcomes. Prognostic models are emerging that predict functional and other outcomes for patients moving from the hospital to post&#x02010;acute care and beyond [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]; however, the implementation and clinical utility of these in real&#x02010;world practice settings remains uncertain. How prognostic models can inform real&#x02010;time counselling of patients about their long&#x02010;term outcomes is a potential avenue for future research.</p><p>Patients and caregivers were desperate for more time with their care teams. There is increasing evidence that patients want their care team to know more about them, given they believe it would enhance the patient&#x02013;clinician relationship, support trust building, improve decision&#x02010;making and satisfaction and result in better care and communication [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, studies have repeatedly described that hospital and SNF clinicians spend less time on direct patient care compared to indirect care activities [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. During transitional care, clinicians must complete indirect clinical and administrative tasks, while the demands on their time are stretched due to high censuses and throughput demands. Care redesign supported by policy and payment incentives that encourage time spent with patients is a challenging suggestion to recommend, but one that has the potential to address many of the drivers of patients' poor experiences during this care transition.</p><p>The disconnect between patients, caregivers and care team members was partly a result of the pervasive use of checklists and standardised workflows. Checklists can be a solution to patient safety and quality issues; however, they can also fail to account for and address complex, challenging healthcare situations [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The hospital&#x02010;to&#x02010;SNF transition is one example where a checklist appears to exacerbate problems rather than solve them. The use of checklists created a clinical task&#x02010;oriented environment that did not allow for tasks or a checkbox to elicit or address patients' individual transition and recovery priorities. Creating opportunities for patients and caregivers to be partners in this transition may offer solutions. One potential approach could be the development of SNF care transition interventions that engage, empower and educate patients. Interventions to engage patients and support goal setting, values elicitation and skill building for communication may also offer a solution to several of the topics identified in this study [<xref rid="hex70248-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="hex70248-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, the geographic restriction to one AMC and SNF in one city may limit transferability to other settings. Second, it only included English speakers and people without ADRD&#x02014;these patient populations should be considered in future research. Third, while the research team's clinical expertise may have enriched the data and analysis, our positionality as clinicians and researchers may have influenced findings in unrecognised ways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="hex70248-sec-0360"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study provides new evidence regarding the drivers and factors that contribute to patients' and caregivers' suboptimal care experiences during the hospital&#x02010;to&#x02010;SNF care transition.
